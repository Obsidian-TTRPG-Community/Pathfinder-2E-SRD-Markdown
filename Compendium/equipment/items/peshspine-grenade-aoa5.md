Peshspine grenades are explosive bombs packed with alchemically treated needles from the pesh cactus. A peshspine grenade deals the listed piercing damage and splash damage. On a hit, the target gains the [stupefied](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) condition until the end of its next turn.

Many types of peshpine grenade grant an item bonus to attack rolls.
