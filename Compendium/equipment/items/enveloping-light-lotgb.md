This tattoo is a series of six concentric circles that show up as a soft yellow on any skin tone. The marks carry in them a protective force that bolsters your body and soul. The first time each day that someone attempts to [Treat your Wounds](../../../Rules/actions/treat-wounds.md) and rolls a critical failure, they get a failure instead.

title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

For 5 rounds, your entire body begins to glow, with the effects of a 1st-level [light](../../../compendium/spells/light.md) spell. At the end of each of your turns during this time, you regain `1d4` Hit Points.
```
