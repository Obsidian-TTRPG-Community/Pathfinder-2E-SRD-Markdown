No matter how carefully you open this bottle, it always lets out an audible, echoing pop. For 1 minute after drinking this potion, you gain a +2 status bonus to [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) checks to hear.

In addition, each time you [Seek](../../../Rules/actions/seek.md), your hearing becomes a precise sense until the beginning of your next turn, allowing you to pinpoint creatures' locations and otherwise perceive the world in detail by listening to the sound of echoes.
