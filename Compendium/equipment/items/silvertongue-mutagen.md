- **Category** Elixir

Your features become striking and your voice becomes musical and commanding, though facts and figures become hazy for you and emotion clouds your ability to reason.

**Benefit** You gain an item bonus to [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](../../skills.md#Diplomacy), [Intimidation](../../skills.md#Intimidation), and [Performance](../../skills.md#Performance) checks. Your critical failures with any of these skill become failures instead.

**Drawback** You take a –2 item penalty to [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana), [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting), [Lore](../../skills.md#Lore), [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism), and [Society](../../skills.md#Society) checks. Choose one skill in which you are trained; for the duration, you become untrained in that skill. All your failures on checks to [Recall Knowledge](../../../Rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) become critical failures.
