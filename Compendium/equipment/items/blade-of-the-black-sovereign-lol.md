This +2 greater striking shock greatsword is forged from standard-grade adamantine, with inlays of [broken](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Broken) circuitry and a robot's ocular lens on the cross guard. A soft thrum comes from the blade, which you feel as a subtle pulse through the grip when wielding it.

It sparks when unsheathed, emitting dim light within 5 feet. On a hit against a foe made of metal, wearing metal armor, or using a metal shield, if the foe takes electricity damage from the blade, the makes the foe [flat-footed](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) for 1 round; if the [Strike](../../../Rules/actions/strike.md) was a critical hit, it also makes them [clumsy](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 round.

You cast the [electric arc](../../../compendium/spells/electric-arc.md) cantrip from the sword as an 8th-level primal spell, using 10 + your melee attack modifier with the Blade of the Black Sovereign as your spell DC.
