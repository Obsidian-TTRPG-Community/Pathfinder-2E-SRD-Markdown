- **Trigger**: You are hit by a melee, ranged, or spell attack

**Effect** The attack misses you, dealing no damage as you transform into a cloud of spores. You gain the benefits of a [gaseous form](../../../compendium/spells/gaseous-form.md) spell for 1 minute. For the duration, a cloud of deadly spores surrounds you. Each breathing creature that begins its turn within 10 feet of you takes `6d8` poison damage (DC 35 basic Fortitude save). You can [Dismiss](../../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) the cloud form.
