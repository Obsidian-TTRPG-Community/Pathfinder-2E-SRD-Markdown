# Breath Like Honey  *Feat 9*  
[gnoll](../../Rules/traits/gnoll-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: sweetbreath gnoll heritage

You smell of honey and savory things. You can cast [enthrall](../spells/enthrall.md) as a 3rd-level occult innate spell once per day, except the spell has a range of 30 feet and the [inhaled](../../Rules/traits/inhaled.md) trait instead of the [auditory](../../Rules/traits/auditory.md) trait. Targets don't gain any circumstance bonus for disagreeing with you. Your circumstance bonus to checks to [Make an Impression](../../Rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) if the target can smell your breath increases to +2.
