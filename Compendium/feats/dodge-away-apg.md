# Dodge Away  [R](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Acrobat Dedication](acrobat-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** You are the target of a melee attack.
- **Requirements**: You're aware of the attack and aren't [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed).
- **Activity** Reaction

You use your acrobatic prowess to evade an attack, using momentum to keep yourself moving, if you choose. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack.

If the attack misses you, you can [Step](../../Rules/actions/step.md) after the [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md). If you're a master in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics), you can move 10 feet on this [Step](../../Rules/actions/step.md) instead of 5 feet.
