# Anticipate Ambush  *Feat 6*  
[exploration](../../Rules/traits/exploration.md)  [rogue](../../Rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth)

Using your extensive knowledge of ambush tactics, you keep watch for any [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) creatures or dangerous sites, moving at half your travel speed. If you're Anticipating an Ambush at the start of an encounter, you roll a [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check for initiative, and all enemies rolling [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) for initiative take a –2 circumstance penalty to their [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) checks.
