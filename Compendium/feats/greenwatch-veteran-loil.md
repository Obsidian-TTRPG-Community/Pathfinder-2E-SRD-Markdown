# Greenwatch Veteran  [F](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 8*  
[gunslinger](../../Rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  [investigator](../../Rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  [ranger](../../Rules/traits/ranger.md)  [rare](../../Rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Trigger** Your turn starts, and you're in combat against a creature you spent at least 10 minutes Tracking.
- **Activity** Free Action

Your time spent tracking your target allows you to quickly identify its weaknesses and relay them to your allies. Attempt a [Recall Knowledge](../../Rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) check against the creature you were Tracking. On a success, you always know the creature's greatest weakness and highest resistance or immunity, in addition to any other information the check would typically provide. You immediately use a quick series of hand gestures to signal this information to any allies who can see you.
