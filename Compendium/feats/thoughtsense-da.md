# Thoughtsense  *Feat 8*  
[divination](../../Rules/traits/divination.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)  [psychic](../../Rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  


You can detect the flickers of mental activity let off by all thinking creatures. You gain thoughtsense as a vague sense that has a range of 30 feet—like all vague senses, it's only about as precise as an average human's sense of smell, meaning you generally can predict only if a creature is present. Your thoughtsense detects only thinking creatures, so a creature that is unthinking or otherwise immune to [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md) effects (such as many constructs and oozes) can't be perceived using your thoughtsense, regardless of how precise it is.

While your [Psyche is Unleashed](../../Rules/actions/unleash-psyche-da.md), your thoughtsense upgrades to an imprecise sense, letting you use it to [Seek](../../Rules/actions/seek.md) out creatures.
