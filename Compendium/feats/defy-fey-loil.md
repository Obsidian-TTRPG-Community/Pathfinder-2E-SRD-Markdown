# Defy Fey  *Feat 6*  
[gunslinger](../../Rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  [investigator](../../Rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  [ranger](../../Rules/traits/ranger.md)  [rare](../../Rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Greenwatch Initiate

You are keen to the wiles of the fey and can usually shake off their magic. Whenever you fail, but don't critically fail, a save against a spell with a duration of at least 1 round cast by a fey creature, you can attempt a second save against the original DC at the start of your next turn to end any lingering effects the spell might have. This can end [persistent damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) caused by a spell but can't reverse [any](../../Rules/traits/any-b1.md) effects that have been resolved already (such as damage dealt when the spell was cast).
