# Caterwaul  [R](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 13*  
[auditory](../../Rules/traits/auditory.md)  [catfolk](../../Rules/traits/catfolk-b1.md)  [concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** An ally within 30 feet would be reduced to 0 HP but not immediately killed.
- **Activity** Reaction

You give a daring yowl in the face of adversity, calling your companion back from the brink of unconsciousness. Your ally isn't knocked out and remains at 1 Hit Point. Your ally's [wounded](../../Rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition still increases by 1 as though they had been [dying](../../Rules/conditions.md#Dying) and recovered.
