# Bless Toxin  *Feat 7*  
[general](../../Rules/traits/general.md)  [negative](../../Rules/traits/negative.md)  [skill](../../Rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting), deity who grants harm divine font

You pour negative energy into toxins you create to further debilitate your targets. When you [Craft](../../Rules/actions/craft.md) an alchemical poison (rather than create it with advanced alchemy, [Quick Alchemy](../../Rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md), or another means), it becomes a blessed alchemical poison and gains the [negative](../../Rules/traits/negative.md) trait. When a creature is afflicted with a blessed alchemical poison, for 1 round, any Hit Points it would regain from a [positive](../../Rules/traits/positive.md) effect are reduced by 5, or by 10 if you are legendary in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting).
