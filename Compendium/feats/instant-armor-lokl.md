# Instant Armor  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Vigilant Dedication](knight-vigilant-dedication-locg.md)

A knight is nothing without their armor, and you know how to keep yours ready. You can perform a 10-minute ritual, which has the [conjuration](../../Rules/traits/conjuration.md) and [magical](../../Rules/traits/magical.md) traits, to divert a set of heavy armor you are wearing into an extradimensional space connected to you. While the armor is in this space, you can use a three-action activity, which has the concentrate, [conjuration](../../Rules/traits/conjuration.md), and [teleportation](../../Rules/traits/teleportation.md) traits, to phase the armor back and instantly don it. The armor automatically phases away if you don another set of armor, if you become [unconscious](../../Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), or if you die. If you are incapable of wearing the armor when it phases back, it appears in your square instead.
