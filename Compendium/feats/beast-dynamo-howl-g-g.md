# Beast Dynamo Howl  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from Arcadia.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You've incorporated beast tech from Arcadia into your dynamo, adding in components from various terrifying creatures to enhance your prosthesis's capabilities. The beast parts can unleash a disturbing howl as you make a powerful attack with your dynamo. Attempt a single [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) check to [Demoralize](../../Rules/actions/demoralize.md) each enemy within 30 feet; you don't take a penalty when you attempt to [Demoralize](../../Rules/actions/demoralize.md) a creature that doesn't understand your language. Then, make a dynamo [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md). Reduce the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour.
