# Stormburst *Spell 5*

- **Range**60 foot

Your voice projects like cracking thunder as you summon a localized storm, creating a fearsome surge of lightning and wind that deals `6d6` electricity damage. Each creature must attempt a Reflex saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is knocked [prone](../../Rules/conditions.md#Prone).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is knocked [prone](../../Rules/conditions.md#Prone), and is [stunned](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stunned).

**Heightened (7th)** The damage increases to `8d6`, and targets who critically fail are [stunned](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stunned).

**Heightened (9th)** The damage increases to `10d6`, and targets who critically fail are [stunned](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
