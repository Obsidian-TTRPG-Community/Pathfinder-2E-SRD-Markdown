# Dispel Magic *Spell 2*   
[abjuration](../../Rules/traits/abjuration.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**1 spell effect or unattended magic item

You unravel the magic behind a spell or effect. Attempt a counteract check against the target (page 458). If you succeed against a spell effect, you counteract it. If you succeed against a magic item, the item becomes a mundane item of its type for 10 minutes. This doesn't change the item's non-magical properties.

If the target is an artifact or similar item, you automatically fail.
