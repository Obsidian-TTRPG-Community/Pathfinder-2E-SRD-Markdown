When you cast this spell, each target transforms into a vaguely cloud-like form and is picked up by a wind moving in the direction of your choice. You can change the wind's direction by using a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait. The wind carries the targets at a Speed of 20 miles per hour, but if any of the targets make an attack, [Cast a Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), come under attack, or otherwise enter encounter mode, the spell ends for all targets just after they roll initiative, and they drift gently to the ground.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
