# Entangle *Spell 2*   
[plant](../../Rules/traits/plant.md)  [transmutation](../../Rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**all squares in a 20-foot burst that contain plants or fungi
- **Duration**1 minute

Plants or fungi in the area entangle creatures. The area counts as difficult terrain. Each round that a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, it takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and on a critical failure, it is also [immobilized](../../Rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) for 1 round. Creatures can attempt to [Escape](../../Rules/actions/escape.md) at entangle's DC to remove these effects.
