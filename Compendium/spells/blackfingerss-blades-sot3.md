[poison](../../Rules/traits/poison.md)  [transmutation](../../Rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**up to 4 weapons, each wielded by a separate willing creature within range
- **Duration**up to 1 minute

You pray for swift and painful death to your enemies and find your and your allies' weapons blessed to deliver just that. The target weapons are coated with giant scorpion venom (Core Rulebook 551) with a DC equal to your spell DC. The effects remain on a weapon for 1 minute or until the weapon deals damage, whichever comes first.
