# Fear the Sun *Spell 2*   
[transmutation](../../Rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude

You cause the creature's vision to become particularly sensitive. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [dazzled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The creature is [dazzled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature gains light blindness (Pathfinder Bestiary 343) for 1 minute. If the creature is already exposed to bright light, it immediately becomes [blinded](../../Rules/conditions.md#Blinded), as it isn't acclimated to its newly acquired light blindness.

**Heightened (6th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
