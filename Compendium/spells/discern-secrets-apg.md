- **Patron** Witch

You call upon your patron's power to better uncover secrets.

When you [Cast the Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), the target can [Recall Knowledge](../../Rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), [Seek](../../Rules/actions/seek.md), or [Sense Motive](../../Rules/actions/sense-motive.md). The target gains a +1 status bonus to the skill or [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) used for the roll, and this bonus remains as long as you [Sustain the Spell](../../Rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md). The target is temporarily immune to discern secrets for 1 minute.

**Heightened (5th)** You can target two creatures instead of one.
