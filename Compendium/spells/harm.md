# Harm *Spell 1*   
[necromancy](../../Rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [negative](../../Rules/traits/negative.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md)
- **Cast** [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") to [>>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**varies
- **Targets**1 living creature or 1 willing undead creature

You channel negative energy to harm the living or heal the undead. If the target is a living creature, you deal `1d8` negative damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save.

If the target is a willing undead creature, you restore that amount of Hit Points. The number of actions you spend when [Casting this Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.

**[>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") (somatic)** The spell has a range of touch.

**[>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") (verbal, somatic)** The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you're healing an undead creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.

**[>>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") (material, verbal, somatic)** You disperse negative energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the area.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The amount of healing or damage increases by `1d8`, and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8.
