[evocation](../../Rules/traits/evocation.md)  [fire](../../Rules/traits/fire.md)  [sonic](../../Rules/traits/sonic.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Area**10-foot burst

A brilliant and clamorous display of sparks and colorful fireworks explode around your enemies, dealing `1d8` fire damage and `1d8` sonic damage to creatures within a 10-foot burst. All creatures in the area must attempt a Reflex save.
