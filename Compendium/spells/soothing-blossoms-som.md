# Soothing Blossoms *Spell 3*   
[conjuration](../../Rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [plant](../../Rules/traits/plant.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Area**10-foot burst
- **Duration**10 minutes

Blossoms grow from the ground in a small area, soothing away afflictions and persistent pains and harm. When any creature in that area rolls a successful save against a [poison](../../Rules/traits/poison.md) or [disease](../../Rules/traits/disease.md) effect, it gets a critical success instead.

The blossoms grant assisted recovery to everyone in the area to end their [persistent damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), both when the spell is cast and at the start of each of your turns.

Once the duration ends, the flowers lose their [magical](../../Rules/traits/magical.md) effect, but a few of them might survive in the area as long as they can naturally. This spell doesn't give a benefit on a save against an affliction unless the stage lasts 10 minutes or less.
