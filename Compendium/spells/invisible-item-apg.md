# Invisible Item *Spell 1*   
[illusion](../../Rules/traits/illusion.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 object
- **Duration**1 hour

You make the object [invisible](../../Rules/conditions.md#Invisible). This makes it [undetected](../../Rules/conditions.md#Undetected) to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making it [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) to them instead if they succeed. If the item is used as part of a [hostile](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action, the spell ends after that [hostile](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action is completed. Making a weapon [invisible](../../Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) typically doesn't give any advantage to the attack, except that an [invisible](../../Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) thrown weapon or piece of ammunition can be used for an attack without necessarily giving information about the attacker's hiding place unless the weapon returns to the attacker.

**Heightened (3rd)** The duration is until the next time you make your daily preparations.

**Heightened (7th)** The duration is unlimited.
