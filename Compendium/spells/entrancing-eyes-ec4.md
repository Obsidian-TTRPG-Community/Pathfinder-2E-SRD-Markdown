# Entrancing Eyes *Spell 7*   
[enchantment](../../Rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  [visual](../../Rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**30-foot emanation centered on you
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

Your eyes glow with an entrancing radiance that captivates those who meet your gaze. Any creature that ends its turn within the emanation must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and becomes immune to this particular casting of the spell. Success The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** Until the end of its next turn, the target is [stupefied](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) and [fascinated](../../Rules/conditions.md#Fascinated).
> - **Critical Failure** Until the end of its next turn, the target is [stupefied](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stupefied), [fascinated](../../Rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), and can't take reactions. In addition, all creatures and objects other than you are [concealed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) from the target. During any round you [Sustain the Spell](../../Rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), you can use a single action, which has the [manipulate](../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait, to focus your entrancing eyes on a single creature you can see within 30 feet. This creature must immediately make a Will save against the spell as if it were ending its turn in the emanation. If the creature was already [fascinated](../../Rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) by your entrancing eyes before its save, a failed save causes it to be [paralyzed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 round. You can't use this action to focus on the same creature more than once per round.
