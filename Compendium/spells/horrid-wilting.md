# Horrid Wilting *Spell 8*   
[necromancy](../../Rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [negative](../../Rules/traits/negative.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**500 foot
- **Targets**any number of living creatures
- **Saving Throw**  basic Fortitude

You pull the moisture from the targets' bodies, dealing `10d10` negative damage. Creatures made of water (such as water elementals) and plant creatures use the outcome for one degree of success worse than the result of their saving throw. Creatures whose bodies contain no significant moisture (such as earth elementals) are immune to horrid wilting.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d10`.
