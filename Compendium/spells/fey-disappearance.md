- **Duration**until the end of your next turn

You become [invisible](../../Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) and ignore natural difficult terrain (such as underbrush). Any [hostile](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action you use ends this invisibility, but you still ignore natural difficult terrain.
