# Prismatic Spray *Spell 7*

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**30-foot cone

A spray of rainbow light beams cascades from your open hand. Each creature in the area must roll `1d8` on the table below to see which beam affects it, then attempt a saving throw of the indicated type. The table notes any additional traits that apply to each type of ray. If a creature is struck by multiple beams, it uses the same d20 result for all its saving throws. For all rays, a successful saving throw negates the effect for that creature.
