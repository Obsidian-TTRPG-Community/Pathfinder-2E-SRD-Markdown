# Spiritual Attunement *Spell 4*   
[abjuration](../../Rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

You attune yourself to a spiritual plane of the Outer Sphere (see sidebar on page 131), connecting your spirit without fully transporting to it. Your [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) and spells gain the alignment traits of the plane you chose, which deals additional damage to creatures with a weakness to either of those alignment traits. Furthermore, the plane protects you from energy of the alignments that oppose the plane. You gain resistance 5 to damage of the alignments that oppose those of your chosen plane. For example, if you chose Heaven, your [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) would gain the [good](../../Rules/traits/good.md) and [lawful](../../Rules/traits/lawful.md) traits, and you would gain resistance to chaotic and evil. If you choose the Boneyard, the resistance is to negative and positive damage instead.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The resistance increases by 5.
