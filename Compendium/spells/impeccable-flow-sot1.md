# Impeccable Flow *Spell 2*   
[divination](../../Rules/traits/divination.md)  [lawful](../../Rules/traits/lawful.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You attune yourself to an underlying cosmic order to the world. While you remain in tune with this power, you gain a +1 status bonus to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks, saving throws, and skill checks. If you critically fail any check while under the effects of this spell, the bonus ends and you instead have a –1 status penalty to all checks for the remaining duration.

**Heightened (5th)** The status bonus increases to +2.

**Heightened (8th)** The status bonus increases to +3.
