# Healer's Blessing *Focus 1*   
[cleric](../../Rules/traits/cleric.md)  [necromancy](../../Rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[healing](../setting/domains.md#Healing)]
- **Cast** [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 willing living creature
- **Duration**1 minute

Your words bless a creature with an enhanced connection to positive energy. When the target regains Hit Points from a healing spell, it regains 2 additional Hit Point.

The target regains additional Hit Points from healer's blessing only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The additional healing increases by 2 HP.
