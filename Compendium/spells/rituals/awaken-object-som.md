You imbue a single Small or smaller object with rudimentary awareness and consciousness, and it gains mental ability modifiers depending on the results of the ritual. It gains the ability to see and hear, and the ability to understand (but not speak) a single language that you know. It's [indifferent](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Indifferent) to you and all living creatures. In all other respects, it's an ordinary object of its type. An awakened object that gains the [broken](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Broken) condition is rendered insensate until Repaired above its [Broken](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Broken) Threshold.

Magical objects and constructs can't be awakened, nor can most spell or magic item abilities be added to an awakened object later (the process to do so is much more complicated than a ritual and essentially creates an intelligent magic.
