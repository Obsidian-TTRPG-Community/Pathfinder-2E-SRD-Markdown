The target appears to fall down dead, though it actually turns [invisible](../../Rules/conditions.md#Invisible). Its illusory corpse remains where it fell, complete with a believable fatal wound. This illusion looks and feels like a dead body. If the target's death seems absurd—for instance, a barbarian at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage—the GM can grant the attacker an immediate [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check to 0. If the target uses [hostile](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hostile) actions, the spell ends. This ends the entire spell, so the illusory corpse disappears too.

**Heightened (7th)** The spell doesn't end if the target uses [hostile](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hostile) actions.
