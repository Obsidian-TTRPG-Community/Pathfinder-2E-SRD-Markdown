# Inevitable Destination *Focus 4*   
[cleric](../../Rules/traits/cleric.md)  [conjuration](../../Rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [rare](../../Rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Domains**: [[travel (apocryphal)](../setting/domains.md#Travel%20(apocryphal))]
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**you and 1 enemy
- **Duration**2 rounds

You twist the paths of the target, ensuring that each one leads to you. The target attempts a Will saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** As failure, plus the target is pulled 10 feet closer to you and falls [prone](../../Rules/conditions.md#Prone), tripping in its haste to move toward you.
> - **Success** Your pull hampers the target's footsteps. It takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the end of its next turn.
> - **Failure** The target can't move any farther from you than it was when you [Cast the Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), though it can move in such a way that it maintains an equal distance. If you move farther away from the target than the initial distance, the spell ends. The targeted foe can attempt to [Escape](../../Rules/actions/escape.md) against your spell DC. If it succeeds, the spell ends.
