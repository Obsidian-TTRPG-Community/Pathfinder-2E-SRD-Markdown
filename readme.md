# Pathfinder 2E Community Vault

> Important: It is very helpful when starting with this vault, to learn what [Absolute Paths Are](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-path-absolute-relative) and what [Markdown Links Are](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links) and why both are used.

This is Obsidian TTRPG Community's Pathfinder 2E Vault, containing nearly everything you need to get started building your next campaign. 


## Required Plugins and Scripts


### Admonitions

[Admonition](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition) by [Javalent](https://github.com/valentine195). 

The Compendium and Rules Folders use custom admonitions to call out and format much of their content.

Without these Admonitions, you will see a lot of ugly text.

You can find the [Admonitions.json](https://github.com/ebullient/ttrpg-convert-cli/tree/main/examples) at the TTRPG-CLI repository. The specific admonitions file for this repository will have `pf2e` in the name. 

You can view instructions how to import the .json file at Javalent's [Plugins Documentation](https://plugins.javalent.com/admonitions/import-json#Obtain%20an%20Admonitions.Json%20File)  site.


### Fantasy Statblocks

[Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks/) by  [Javalent](https://github.com/valentine195). 

Fantasy Statblocks makes the Bestiary usable and pretty. It also integrates nicely with [Initiative Tracker](https://github.com/javalent/initiative-tracker).

Having issues with the Pathfinder 2E layout? Report an issue at the [Pathfinder 2E Development Repository](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/Pathfinder-2E-Statblocks-Development).

> **Hint**: If Using ITS Theme, turn off Statblock styling in Style Settings. This will make the Statblock look as it should. 


## Not Optional, But Highly Recommended


### Pathfinder CSS

In order to add little tweaks to the Pathfinder 2E Files, we highly recommend downloading the [Pathfinder 2E CSS](https://github.com/ebullient/ttrpg-convert-cli/tree/main/examples/css-snippets) and adding it to your snippets folder.


### Force Note View in Frontmatter

[Obsidian force view mode of note](https://github.com/bwydoogh/obsidian-force-view-mode-of-note) by Bwydoogh

This plugin automatically switches a note to source or reading mode based off a key/value pair within the frontmatter of the note. 

The non-bestiary files are all equipped with this frontmatter setup.



## Special Thanks
This community vault has been brought to you by the efforts of many individuals. 

- [eBullient](https://github.com/ebullient), for their [TTRPG-Covert-CLI](https://github.com/ebullient/ttrpg-convert-cli) which pulls the data from PF2ETools and converts it to Markdown Form.
- [Javalent](https://github.com/valentine195), for their useful plugins help make some of the painful parts of 
  this process much easier. 
- [Sigrunixia](https://github.com/sigrunixia), eventually, for their over-spazzing on the CSS and getting the thing uploaded onto the Vault.
- [Robinsving](https://github.com/robinsving), whose dataview spells will get re-added to the CLI spell format, soon. (I promise.)

If I forgot someone, poke me – Sigrunixia
