- **[Identify Magic](rules/actions/identify-magic.md)**, particularly arcane magic.
- **[Learn a Spell](rules/actions/learn-a-spell.md)** from the [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait") tradition.

_Source: Core Rulebook p. 241_

Athletics allows you to perform deeds of physical prowess. When you use the [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) basic action, you can use your [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) modifier instead of your unarmed attack modifier.

## Crafting
_Source: Core Rulebook p. 243_

You can use this skill to create, understand, and repair items. Even if you're untrained, you can [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md).

- **[Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md)** about alchemical reactions, the value of items, engineering, unusual materials, and alchemical or mechanical creatures. The GM determines which creatures this applies to, but it usually includes constructs.

<sup>CRB p. 243</sup>

You must be trained in Crafting to use it to [Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md).

- **[Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md)** by crafting goods for the market.

## Deception
_Source: Core Rulebook p. 245_

You can trick and mislead others using disguises, lies, and other forms of subterfuge.

## Diplomacy
_Source: Core Rulebook p. 246_

You influence others through negotiation and flattery.

## Intimidation
_Source: Core Rulebook p. 247_

You bend others to your will using threats.

## Lore
_Source: Core Rulebook p. 247_

You have specialized information on a narrow topic. Lore features many subcategories. You might have Military Lore, Sailing Lore, Vampire Lore, or any similar subcategory of the skill. Each subcategory counts as its own skill, so applying a skill increase to Planar Lore wouldn't increase your proficiency with Sailing Lore, for example.

You gain a specific subcategory of the Lore skill from your background. The GM determines what other subcategories they'll allow as Lore skills, though these categories are always less broad than any of the other skills that allow you to Recall Knowledge, and they should never be able to fully or mainly take the place of another skill's [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) action. For instance, you couldn't choose Magic Lore to recall the breadth of knowledge about magic covered by Arcana, Nature, Occultism, and Religion, or Adventuring Lore to give you all the information an adventurer needs, or Planar Lore to gain all the information spread across various skills and subcategories such as Heaven Lore.

If you have multiple subcategories of Lore that could apply to a check or that would overlap with another skill in the circumstances, you can use the skill with the better skill modifier or the one you would prefer to use. If there's any doubt whether a Lore skill applies to a specific topic or action, the GM decides whether it can be used or not.

Even if you're untrained in Lore, you can use it to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md).

- **[Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md)** about the subject of your Lore skill's subcategory.

### Lore Trained Actions

You must be trained in Lore to use it to [Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md).

- **[Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md)** by using your knowledge to practice a trade.

## Medicine
_Source: Core Rulebook p. 248_

You can patch up wounds and help people recover from diseases and poisons. Even if you're untrained in Medicine, you can use it to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md).

- **[Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md)** about diseases, injuries, poisons, and other ailments. You can use this to perform forensic examinations if you spend 10 minutes (or more, as determined by the GM) checking for evidence such as wound patterns. This is most useful when determining how a body was injured or killed.

## Nature
_Source: Core Rulebook p. 249_

You know a great deal about the natural world, and you command and train animals and magical beasts. Even if you're untrained in Nature, you can use it to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md).

- **[Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md)** about fauna, flora, geography, weather, the environment, creatures of natural origin (like animals, beasts, fey, and plants), the First World, the Material Plane, and the Elemental Planes.

- **[Identify Magic](rules/actions/identify-magic.md)**, particularly primal magic.

## Occultism
_Source: Core Rulebook p. 249_

You know a great deal about ancient philosophies, esoteric lore, obscure mysticism, and supernatural creatures. Even if you're untrained in Occultism, you can use it to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md).

- **[Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md)** about ancient mysteries; obscure philosophies; creatures of occult significance (like aberrations, spirits, and oozes); and the Positive Energy, Negative Energy, Shadow, Astral, and Ethereal Planes.

### Occultism Trained Actions
<sup>CRB p. 249</sup>

You must be trained in Occultism to use it for the following general skill actions.

- **[Decipher Writing](rules/actions/decipher-writing.md)** on occult topics, including complex metaphysical systems, syncretic principles, weird philosophies, and incoherent ramblings.
- **[Identify Magic](rules/actions/identify-magic.md)**, particularly occult magic.
- **[Learn a Spell](rules/actions/learn-a-spell.md)** from the [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait") tradition.

## Perception
_Source: Core Rulebook p. 448_

Perception measures your ability to be aware of your environment. Every creature has Perception, which works with and is limited by a creature's senses (described on page 464). Whenever you need to attempt a check based on your awareness, you'll attempt a Perception check. Your Perception uses your Wisdom modifier, so you'll use the following formula when attempting a Perception check.

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Perception check result = d20 roll + Wisdom modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties

Nearly all creatures are at least trained in Perception, so you will almost always add a proficiency bonus to your Perception modifier. You might add a circumstance bonus for advantageous situations or environments, and typically get status bonuses from spells or other magical effects. Items can also grant you a bonus to Perception, typically in a certain situation. For instance, a fine spyglass grants a +1 item bonus to Perception when attempting to see something a long distance away. Circumstance penalties to Perception occur when an environment or situation (such as fog) hampers your senses, while status penalties typically come from conditions, spells, and magic effects that foil the senses. You'll rarely encounter item penalties or untyped penalties for Perception.

Many abilities are compared to your Perception DC to determine whether they succeed. Your Perception DC is 10 + your total Perception modifier.

### Perception for Initiative
<sup>CRB p. 448</sup>

Often, you'll roll a Perception check to determine your order in initiative. When you do this, instead of comparing the result against a DC, everyone in the encounter will compare their results. The creature with the highest result acts first, the creature with the second-highest result goes second, and so on. Sometimes you may be called on to roll a skill check for initiative instead, but you'll compare results just as if you had rolled Perception. The full rules for initiative are found in the rules for encounter mode on page 468.

## Performance
_Source: Core Rulebook p. 250_

You are skilled at a form of performance, using your talents to impress a crowd or make a living.

### Basic Competence
<sup>CRB p. 250</sup>

Some performances require you to be more than just charismatic, and if you don't meet the demands of the art form or the audience, the GM might apply a penalty based on the relevant ability score. For example, if you're dancing and have a negative Dexterity modifier, you might take a penalty to your attempt at dancing. Likewise, if you are orating and have a negative Intelligence modifier, you might have to hope your raw Charisma can overcome the penalties from your intellectual shortcomingsâ€”or ask someone to help write your speeches!

### Performance Traits
<sup>CRB p. 250</sup>

When you use an action that utilizes the Performance skill, it gains one or more traits relevant to the type of performance. The GM might change these depending on the circumstances, but the most common performance based traits are listed below.

| Performance | Additional Traits |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Act or perform comedy | [Auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait"), [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait"), and [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") |

## Religion
_Source: Core Rulebook p. 250_

The secrets of deities, dogma, faith, and the realms of divine creatures both sublime and sinister are open to you. You also understand how magic works, though your training imparts a religious slant to that knowledge. Even if you're untrained in Religion, you can use it to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md).

- **[Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md)** about divine agents, the finer points of theology, obscure myths regarding a faith, and creatures of religious significance (like celestials, fiends, and undead), the Outer Sphere, and the Positive and Negative Energy Planes.
