- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Activity** Single Action

Due to your origins, your form is more flexible than most. You shift your appearance to resemble a creature within 30 feet but with an unsettling, horrifying twist. Though this transformation is momentary, witnessing it gives the target deep existential dread. It must succeed at a Will save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or become [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) ([frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical failure) and be [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) as long as the [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition lasts. Once you've used Warped Reflection against a creature, it's temporarily immune for 24 hours.
