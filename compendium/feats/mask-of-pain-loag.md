# Mask Of Pain  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 9*  
[orc](rules/traits/orc.md "Orc Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), [Orc Warmask](compendium/feats/orc-warmask-loag.md)
- **Trigger** You succeed at a [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) check.
- **Requirements**: You're wearing your warmask.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your mask has grown into a manifestation of your pain, which you can release. The creature you successfully [Demoralized](rules/actions/demoralize.md) takes `2d6` mental damage, or `4d6` mental damage if you're legendary in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation).

The target is then temporarily immune to additional damage from Mask of Pain for 24 hours.
