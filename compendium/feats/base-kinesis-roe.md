# Base Kinesis  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Kineticist Dedication](compendium/feats/kineticist-dedication-roe.md)

You gain the [Base Kinesis](rules/actions/base-kinesis-roe.md) impulse. For the purposes of determining when the range and Bulk improvements of the action occur, your kineticist level is equal to half your level (for example, [Base Kinesis](rules/actions/base-kinesis-roe.md) for a 10th- level character with this feat would have a range of 45 feet and could affect 1 Bulk of their chosen element).
