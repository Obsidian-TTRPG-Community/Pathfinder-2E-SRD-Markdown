# Voice Cold as Death  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 7*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Reclaimant Dedication](compendium/feats/knight-reclaimant-dedication-locg.md), master in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation)
- **Requirements**: You are not [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued).
- **Activity** Single Action

Channeling the energy of the Crimson Oath into your voice, you pronounce a threat in a tone so icy it freezes the blood. Attempt an [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check to [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md); you don't suffer a penalty if the target doesn't understand the language you're speaking, but this otherwise functions as normal. You can't use Intimidating Glare or any other effect that would cause your [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) attempt to lose the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") trait as part of using this feat. If you critically succeed at your [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check, the target becomes [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned), or [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) if the target is undead. After using this feat, you are [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) until the end of your next turn, and you can't use this feat again until the end of your next turn.
