# Past Life  *Feat 5*  
[skeleton](rules/traits/skeleton-b1.md "Skeleton Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Flashes of your life become clearer and more frequent, allowing you to apply skills you developed while alive. You become trained in a skill of your choice and gain the [Additional Lore](compendium/feats/additional-lore.md) feat for a [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) subcategory tied to your life.
