# Hail of Splinters  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 1*  
[impulse](rules/traits/impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](rules/traits/kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [overflow](rules/traits/overflow-roe.md "Overflow Action & Ability Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [wood](rules/traits/wood-roe.md "Wood Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

A fusillade of jagged splinters flies from you. Creatures in a 30-foot cone take `1d4` piercing damage and `1d4` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) with a basic Reflex save against your class DC.
