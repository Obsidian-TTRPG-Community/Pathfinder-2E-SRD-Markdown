# Astonishing Explosion  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 20*  
[additive <2>](rules/traits/additive-2.md "Additive Feat Trait")  [alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md "Alchemist Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Trigger** You use [Quick Alchemy](rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md) to craft an alchemical bomb that deals splash damage and is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.
- **Activity** Free Action

Your bomb incorporates an explosive spark of wonder that leaves witnesses dumbfounded. Any target hit by your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the bomb is [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) by you for 1 round. On a critical success, the target is also [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
