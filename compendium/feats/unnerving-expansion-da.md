# Unnerving Expansion  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Curse Maelstrom Dedication](compendium/feats/curse-maelstrom-dedication-da.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You gather your curse around you and impel it to pour outward, expanding your maelstrom. The radius of the emanation of your curse maelstrom state increases by 5 feet until the end of your curse maelstrom state. The outpouring of the curse is unnerving. You attempt to [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) a creature within the emanation of your curse maelstrom; you don't take penalties for not sharing a language with that creature.
