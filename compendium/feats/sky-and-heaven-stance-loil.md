Your jagged blows are like lightning. The only Strikes you can make are skyward slash unarmed attacks. These unarmed attacks deal `1d10` slashing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the nonlethal, unarmed, and versatile P traits. While in Sky and Heaven Stance, you gain resistance 2 to electricity and resistance 2 to sonic damage. These resistances increase to 5 at 12th level and to 8 at 18th level.
