[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghost Hunter Dedication](compendium/feats/ghost-hunter-dedication-av1.md)

You are skilled at noticing the telltale signs of ghosts and hauntings. Even when you aren't Investigating in exploration mode, you get a check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about incorporeal undead and haunts active in the area. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to disable haunts.
