# Halo  *Feat 1*  
[aasimar](rules/traits/aasimar-apg.md)  


You are surrounded by a halo of light and goodness at all times. Your halo sheds light with the effects of a divine [light](compendium/spells/light.md) cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. You can suppress or reestablish the halo with a single action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait.

## Halo leads to...

[Healer's Halo](compendium/feats/healers-halo-loag.md)
