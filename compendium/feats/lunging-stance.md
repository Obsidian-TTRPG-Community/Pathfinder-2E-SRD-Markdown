# Lunging Stance  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md), [Lunge](compendium/feats/lunge.md)
- **Requirements**: You are wielding a melee weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

Your body coiled to strike, you can lash out at distant enemies. While you are in this stance, you can use [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md) against a creature that is outside your reach but within the reach you would have with a Lunge. If you do, you increase your range with the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) by 5 feet.
