# Aquatic Eyes  *Feat 1*  
[undine](rules/traits/undine-b2.md "Undine Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


As your connection to water grows, you can see more easily in places with less light, such as the depths of the ocean. You gain [low-light vision](rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md), or you gain [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md) if your ancestry already has [low-light vision](rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md).

**Special.** If your ancestry has neither [low-light vision](rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md) nor [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md), you can take this ancestry feat a second time to gain [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md). You can't retrain out of this feat.
