# Persistent Creation  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Halcyon Speaker Dedication](compendium/feats/halcyon-speaker-dedication-locg.md)

You can cast [creation](compendium/spells/creation.md) as an innate spell at will, choosing whether it is arcane or primal each time. The created object lasts until you spend 1 hour not within its immediate vicinity or until it is destroyed. Such objects are called persistent creations. If you cast [creation](compendium/spells/creation.md) again, any persistent creation you previously created with the spell immediately disintegrates.

## Persistent Creation leads to...

[Charged Creation](compendium/feats/charged-creation-locg.md)
