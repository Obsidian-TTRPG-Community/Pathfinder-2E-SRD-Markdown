[goloma](rules/traits/goloma-lome.md "Goloma Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: ability to cast the [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) cantrip

You've trained yourself to constantly be on the lookout for [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") effects, even when focusing on looking out for other things. When you are [Searching](rules/actions/search.md), you also gain the benefits of Detect Magic unless you choose not to. See page 479 of the Core Rulebook for more information about exploration activities.
