# Whirling Blade Stance  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Monastic Weaponry](compendium/feats/monastic-weaponry.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a mindful stance that creates a deep connection between you and your monk weapons, allowing you to manipulate them with your ki even at a distance. All melee monk weapons you wield with the [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait") trait gain the thrown 10 feet trait (unless they already have the [thrown](rules/traits/thrown.md "Thrown Weapon Trait") trait with a greater range)

Once you've made a thrown [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with such a weapon, you can use the precision of your throw to make additional strikes with it, even from a distance. Start from the space of the previous [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)'s target to determine the range increment and whether the new target has cover. At the end of your turn, the thrown weapon flies directly back to you in a straight line. If a solid barrier blocks its path, it falls to the ground after hitting the barrier.
