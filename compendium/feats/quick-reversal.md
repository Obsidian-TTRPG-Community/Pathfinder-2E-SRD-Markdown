# Quick Reversal  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  [flourish](rules/traits/flourish.md "Flourish Combat Trait")  [press](rules/traits/press.md "Press Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You are flanked by at least two enemies.
- **Activity** Single Action

You turn your foes' flanking against them with a quick reverse. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against one of the flanking enemies and make a second [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the same weapon or unarmed attack against a different enemy that is flanking you. This second [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) has the same multiple attack penalty of the initial attack and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.
