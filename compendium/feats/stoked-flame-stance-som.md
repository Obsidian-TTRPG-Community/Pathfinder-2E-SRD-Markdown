# Stoked Flame Stance  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md)  [monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a stance of fast, fiery movements. You can make flashing spark attacks that deal `1d8` slashing damage. They are in the brawling group and have the [forceful](rules/traits/forceful.md), [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md), [sweep](rules/traits/sweep.md), and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits. If you have access to the flashing sparks' critical specialization effect, you can take an alternate effect instead: if your critical [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) dealt damage, the target takes `1d6` [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

While in Stoked Flame Stance, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed. If you have incredible movement, increase the benefit from incredible movement to a +15-foot status bonus plus 5 feet for every 4 levels beyond 3rd.

**Special.** This feat gains your choice of either the [divine](rules/traits/divine.md) or [occult](rules/traits/occult.md) trait, matching your ki spell tradition if possible.

## Stoked Flame Stance leads to...

[Blazing Streak](compendium/feats/blazing-streak-som.md), [Inner Fire](compendium/feats/inner-fire-som.md)
