# Remediate  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 16*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: harmful font or healing font
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Activity** Free Action

If your next action is to use your divine font to cast a 3-action [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) or [harm](compendium/spells/harm.md) spell to damage creatures, you can harness the residual energy to counterbalance opposing forces. You use your [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) or [harm](compendium/spells/harm.md) spell to attempt to counteract one effect in the spell's area with the [chaotic](rules/traits/chaotic.md "Chaotic Alignment Trait"), [evil](rules/traits/evil.md "Evil Alignment Trait"), [good](rules/traits/good.md "Good Alignment Trait"), or [lawful](rules/traits/lawful.md "Lawful Alignment Trait") trait. The chosen trait must oppose one component of your deity's alignment; if your deity is neutral, you can choose any one trait.
