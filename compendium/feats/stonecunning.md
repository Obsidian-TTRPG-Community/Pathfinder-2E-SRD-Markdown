# Stonecunning  *Feat 1*  
[dwarf](rules/traits/dwarf.md "Dwarf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You have a knack for noticing even small inconsistencies and craftsmanship techniques in the stonework around you. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to notice unusual stonework. This bonus applies to checks to discover mechanical traps made of stone or [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) within stone.

If you aren't using the [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) action or [Searching](rules/actions/search.md), the GM automatically rolls a secret check for you to notice unusual stonework anyway. This check doesn't gain the circumstance bonus, and it takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty.
