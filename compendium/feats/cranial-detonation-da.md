# Cranial Detonation  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 18*  
[death](rules/traits/death.md)  [mindshift](rules/traits/mindshift-da.md)  [psyche](rules/traits/psyche-da.md)  [psychic](rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Trigger** You successfully reduce one or more non-mindless enemies to 0 Hit Points with a spell.
- **Activity** Free Action

As your overwhelming psyche fells a creature, you use its flickering consciousness to detonate psychic energy from the creature's head. Each enemy you reduced to 0 Hit Points dies and its head explodes. Each exploding head generates a shockwave in a 15-foot emanation around that enemy. Each creature in any of the emanations takes `10d6` bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save. If this damage reduces an enemy to 0 Hit Points, its head also explodes, potentially damaging more creatures and potentially causing more detonations. A given creature can take damage only once from a single use of Cranial Detonation.
