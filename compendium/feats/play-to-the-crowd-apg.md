# Play To The Crowd  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Gladiator Dedication](compendium/feats/gladiator-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** You reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points during a non-trivial combat encounter with spectators.
- **Activity** Reaction

You show off for the crowd. Attempt a [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check; the DC is determined by the GM but is typically the standard DC for your level or the DC to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on the spectators, whichever is higher. On a success, choose one of the following benefits; on a critical success, choose two benefits:

- A number of temporary Hit Points equal to your character level; these last for 1 minute.
- A +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.
- A +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll before the end of your next turn.
