# Form Retention  *Feat 8*  
[wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md "Wizard Class Trait")  


You have trained your mind and body to tolerate [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait") magic for longer periods of time, so long as you prepare for the change appropriately. When preparing a polymorph spell that lasts 1 minute and grants a battle form, you can prepare the spell in a slot 2 levels higher than normal. This doesn't grant any of the normal benefits of heightening a spell, but the spell lasts up to 10 minutes. For example, if you prepared [animal form](compendium/spells/animal-form.md) in a 4th-level slot with Form Retention, you would cast a 2nd-level animal form that lasts for up to 10 minutes. If the spell can be [Dismissed](rules/actions/dismiss.md), that doesn't change.
