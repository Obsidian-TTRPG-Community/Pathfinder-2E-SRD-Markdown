# Claws Of The Dragon  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dragon Disciple Dedication](compendium/feats/dragon-disciple-dedication-apg.md)

Your fingernails grow into razor-sharp claws, and scales speckle your fingers, hands, and wrists. Your claws are [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait"), [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait") unarmed attacks that deal `1d6` slashing damage and are in the brawling weapon group.

If you're a draconic sorcerer, when you cast [dragon claws](compendium/spells/dragon-claws.md), increase the spell's slashing damage die from `d4` to `d6` and increase the resistance to 10 at 1st level, 15 at 5th level, and 20 at 9th level.
