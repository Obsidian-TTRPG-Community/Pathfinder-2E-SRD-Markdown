# Scholar's Inheritance  *Feat 1*  
[suli](rules/traits/suli-b2.md)  


Your parents devoted themselves to alchemical experiments involving elemental energy.

You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting). If you would automatically become trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the [Alchemical Crafting](compendium/feats/alchemical-crafting.md) skill feat.
