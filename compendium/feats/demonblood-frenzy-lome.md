# Demonblood Frenzy  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 5*  
[orc](rules/traits/orc.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Matanji ethnicity
- **Prerequisites**: tusks unarmed attack
- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Trigger** You successfully [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) a living creature that has the [fiend](rules/traits/fiend.md) trait with your tusks unarmed attack.
- **Activity** Reaction

Just the taste of fiendish blood is enough to send blood rushing through your veins in a supernatural fury. You become [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) until the end of your next turn and you can use the extra action to make a tusks [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), or [Step](rules/actions/step.md).
