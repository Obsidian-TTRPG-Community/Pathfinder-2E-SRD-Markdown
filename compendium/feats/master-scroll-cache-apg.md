# Master Scroll Cache  *Feat 18*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Expert Scroll Cache](compendium/feats/expert-scroll-cache-apg.md)

Your scroll collection is incredible, brimming with eldritch power, and you can prepare far more of them than an ordinary scroll trickster. In addition to your daily scrolls from the Basic and Expert Scroll Caches, add a single scroll with a 6th-level spell. At 20th level, add a scroll with a 7th-level spell.
