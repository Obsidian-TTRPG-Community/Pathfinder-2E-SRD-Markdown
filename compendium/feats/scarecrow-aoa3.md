- **Prerequisites**: [Bellflower Dedication](compendium/feats/bellflower-dedication-aoa3.md)

You fight fiercely to protect your crop. When you hit a creature that is adjacent to two or more members of your crop with a weapon or unarmed attack, you gain a circumstance bonus to your damage roll equal to the number of weapon damage dice. When you hit a creature who has a member of your crop [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), that member can attempt to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) using a reaction.
