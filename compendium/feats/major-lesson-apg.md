# Major Lesson  *Feat 10*  
[witch](rules/traits/witch-apg.md "Witch Class Trait")  


Your patron grants you even greater secrets. Choose a major, greater, or basic lesson. You gain its associated hex, and your familiar learns the associated spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.

**Special.** You can select this feat a second time if you're 14th level or higher, and a third time if you're 18th level or higher. Choose a different lesson each time.
