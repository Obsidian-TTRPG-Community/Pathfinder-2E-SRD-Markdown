# Scapegoat Parallel Self  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 20*  
[divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md "Oracle Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** Your turn starts or your oracular curse would advance.
- **Activity** Reaction

Seeing Syndara superimpose creatures with similar metaphysical properties, you've realized a way to manipulate the effects of your oracular curse.

You immediately change your curse to its minor, moderate, or major stage, or back to its mild form, exchanging the [curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait") effect with that of a parallel version of yourself in another reality.
