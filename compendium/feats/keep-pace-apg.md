- **Trigger** Your prey is within reach and attempts to move away from you.

Your prey can't escape. [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout its movement until it stops moving or you've moved your full Speed. You can use Keep Pace to [Burrow](rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md), [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
