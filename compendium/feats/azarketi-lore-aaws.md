# Azarketi Lore  *Feat 1*  
[azarketi](rules/traits/azarketi-loag.md "Azarketi Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You have learned the history and origins of your people and how to connect to both your land and sea heritage. You become trained in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) and [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Azarketi Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).
