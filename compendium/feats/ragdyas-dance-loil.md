# Ragdya's Dance  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 9*  
[vanara](rules/traits/vanara-loil.md "Vanara Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger** An adjacent [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed) creature succeeds at an attack roll against you.
- **Activity** Reaction

Even when faced with deadly danger, you fight with the rapturous laughter of [Ragdya](compendium/setting/deities/ragdya-logm.md) in your heart and can play impossible tricks. After resolving the successful attack, the triggering creature must attempt a Will save against the higher of your class DC or your spell DC. On a failure, you and the triggering creature switch places. You and the triggering creature must each be able to fit in the new space, and your positions must be unoccupied.
