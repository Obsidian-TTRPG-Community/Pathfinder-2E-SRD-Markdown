# Uzunjati Storytelling  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](compendium/feats/magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), Uzunjati affiliation, master in a [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) skill
- **Activity** Single Action

You tell a quick story or begin telling a longer tale. This is most useful when you want to prove your scholarly credibility or impress someone quickly. Roll a check with a skill that can be used to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) in which you have expert proficiency, using the result entry for the [Perform](rules/actions/perform.md) action. Like Performing, Storytelling rarely has an effect on its own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks against the observers—or even change their attitudes—if the GM sees fit. This action is not a [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) and cannot be used in place of anything that requires you to [Perform](rules/actions/perform.md).

## Uzunjati Storytelling leads to...

[Uzunjati Recollection](compendium/feats/uzunjati-recollection-locg.md), [Janatimo's Lessons](compendium/feats/janatimos-lessons-lol.md)
