# Shared Stratagem  *Feat 2*  
[investigator](rules/traits/investigator-apg.md "Investigator Class Trait")  


The plans you make include your allies as well as yourself. When you hit a creature with an attack on which you substituted your attack roll due to Devising a Stratagem, designate one ally. The creature you hit is flat-footed to that ally on the next attack the designated ally makes against that creature before the start of your next turn.
