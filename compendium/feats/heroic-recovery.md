# Heroic Recovery  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: healing font, good alignment
- **Activity** Single Action

The restorative power of your healing invigorates the recipient. If the next action you use is to cast [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) targeting a single living creature and the target regains Hit Points from the spell, it also gains three bonuses until the end of its next turn: a +5-foot status bonus to its Speed, a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, and a +1 status bonus to damage rolls.
