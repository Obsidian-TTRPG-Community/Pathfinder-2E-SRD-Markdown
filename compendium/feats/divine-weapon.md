# Divine Weapon  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 6*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per turn
- **Trigger** You finish [Casting a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) using one of your divine spell slots on your turn.
- **Activity** Free Action

You siphon residual spell energy into a weapon you're wielding. Until the end of your turn, the weapon deals an additional `1d4` force damage. You can instead deal an additional `1d6` damage of an alignment type that matches one of your deity's alignment components. As usual for aligned damage, this can damage only creatures of the opposite alignment.
