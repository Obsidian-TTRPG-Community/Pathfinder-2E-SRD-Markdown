# Morrigna's Spider Affinity  *Feat 9*  
[duskwalker](rules/traits/duskwalker-apg.md "Duskwalker Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Much like morrignas, you feel an affinity for spiders. You can cast [animal messenger](compendium/spells/animal-messenger.md) (spiders only), speak with animals (spiders only), and spider climb each once per day as 2nd-level divine innate spells.
