# Night's Warning  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Oatia Skysage Dedication](compendium/feats/oatia-skysage-dedication-gw1.md)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger** A creature targets you with an attack and you can see the attacker.
- **Requirements**: You can see the night sky.
- **Activity** Reaction

Portents written in the night sky show you how to avoid an attack. The triggering attack roll targets your [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) DC instead of your AC. Though this allows you to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn't remove any conditions or other effects causing such penalties.

For example, an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra damage to you for being [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed), even though you wouldn't take the â€“2 circumstance penalty when defending against the attack.
