You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks attempted as initiative rolls.

Additionally, if your initiative roll result is tied with that of an opponent, you go first, regardless of whether you rolled [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) or not.
