# Side By Side (Druid)  *Feat 10*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Animal Companion

You and your animal companion fight in tandem, distracting your foes and keeping them off balance. Whenever you and your animal companion are adjacent to the same foe, you are both flanking that foe with each other, regardless of your actual positions.
