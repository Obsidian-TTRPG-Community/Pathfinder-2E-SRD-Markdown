# Crown of the Saumen Kar  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pactbound Dedication](compendium/feats/pactbound-dedication-lomm.md)

Your body begins to evolve and adapt, taking the first steps  towards blending your very self with the ancient curse of  the saumen kar. You become larger and bulkier, pushing the very edge of height and weight for your size. You gain [scent](rules/abilities/scent.md) as an imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks made to [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md) or [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) in areas of forest and snow. You sprout a pair of horns from your forehead, gaining a horns unarmed attack that deals `1d8` bludgeoning damage. Your horns are in the brawling group and have the [shove](rules/traits/shove.md "Shove Weapon Trait") and [trip](rules/traits/trip.md "Trip Weapon Trait") traits.
