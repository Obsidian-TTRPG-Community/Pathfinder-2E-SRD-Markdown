- **Activity** Two-Action

You unleash a small, localized tremor in a 10-foot burst within 30 feet. Each creature in the area takes `1d8` bludgeoning damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC. A creature that critically fails is knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone). Earth and stone in the area is difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.
