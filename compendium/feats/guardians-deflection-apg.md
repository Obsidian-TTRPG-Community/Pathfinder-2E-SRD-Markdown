# Guardian's Deflection  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md "Swashbuckler Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** An ally within your melee reach is hit by an attack, you can see the attacker, and a +2 circumstance bonus to AC would turn the critical hit into a hit or the hit into a miss.
- **Requirements**: You are wielding a single one-handed melee weapon and have your other hand or hands free.
- **Activity** Reaction

You use your weapon to deflect the attack against your ally, granting a +2 circumstance bonus to their AC against the triggering attack. This turns the triggering critical hit into a hit, or the triggering hit into a miss.
