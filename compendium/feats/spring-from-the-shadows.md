# Spring From The Shadows  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[flourish](rules/traits/flourish.md)  [rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

Leaping out from hiding, you assail your target when they least expect it. You [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed, but you must end your movement next to an enemy you're [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from or [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by. You then [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that enemy; you remain [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from or [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by that creature until after you [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). You can use Spring from the Shadows while [Burrowing](rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climbing](rules/actions/climb.md), [Flying](rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Striding](rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
