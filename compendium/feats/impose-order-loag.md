# Impose Order  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 13*  
[aphorite](rules/traits/aphorite-loag.md)  [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You would critically fail a skill check or suffer an effect with the [misfortune](rules/traits/misfortune.md) trait.
- **Activity** Reaction

You shift the underlying fabric of reality to impose a baseline of order.

If the trigger was a skill check, you instead receive a result of 10 + your proficiency bonus (don't apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers). If the trigger was an effect with the [misfortune](rules/traits/misfortune.md) trait, the [misfortune](rules/traits/misfortune.md) and [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md) effects cancel each other out as normal, negating the triggering [misfortune](rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect.
