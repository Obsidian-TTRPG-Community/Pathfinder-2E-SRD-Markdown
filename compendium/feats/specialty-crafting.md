# Specialty Crafting  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

Your training focused on [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) one particular kind of item. Select one of the specialties; you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) checks to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) items of that type. If you are a master in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting), this bonus increases to +2. If it's unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides. Some specialties might apply only partially. For example, if you were making a [morningstar](compendium/equipment/items/morningstar.md) and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.
