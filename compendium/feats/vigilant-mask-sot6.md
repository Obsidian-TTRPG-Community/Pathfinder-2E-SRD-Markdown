# Vigilant Mask  *Feat 20*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md "Wizard Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication

Your mask grants the extraordinary magical senses of Carmine Jaws, the Hyena who Looks Between. You gain scent as a precise sense to a range of 60 feet. If you already have scent as a precise sense, increase its range by 60 feet. You can sometimes catch a faint whiff of magic itself. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell, your scent extends between worlds, like Carmine Jaws's own.

This causes you to be able to smell ethereal creatures, those in an extradimensional space with an aperture that's within your scent range, incorporeal creatures and objects, and other creatures and objects that are insubstantial or not fully in phase with reality. Unlike your normal scent, this is an imprecise sense.
