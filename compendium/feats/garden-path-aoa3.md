# Garden Path  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bellflower Dedication](compendium/feats/bellflower-dedication-aoa3.md)

You can guide your crop to move without notice. When you and any of your crop are [Avoiding Notice](rules/actions/avoid-notice.md), you can choose one member of your crop to temporarily gain the benefits of the [Quiet Allies](compendium/feats/quiet-allies.md) skill feat until the group is no longer [Avoiding Notice](rules/actions/avoid-notice.md). The group rolls two checks instead of one, using the higher die roll. This is a [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait") effect.
