# One with the Land  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mummy Dedication](compendium/feats/mummy-dedication-botd.md)

Your connection to your bound terrain strengthens, making you unhindered by local weather. When in your bound terrain, you ignore the effects of non-magical difficult terrain. In addition, your experience from your bound terrain lets you ignore circumstance penalties to visual [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks and ignore [concealment](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) caused by certain environmental effects. The types you ignore depend on your bound terrain.

- **Arctic** Ice or snow
- **Desert** Dust or sand
- **Mountain** Clouds or mist
- **Swamp** Rain or murky water
