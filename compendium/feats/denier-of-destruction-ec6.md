# Denier Of Destruction  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 20*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: healing font
- **Trigger** Any ally within 30 feet that you can heal with your [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) spell would take damage from an attack or effect from a source you can observe.
- **Requirements**: You have a [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) spell prepared and you aren't [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to the source of the damage.
- **Activity** Reaction

You can manipulate the same energies that the aeon orbs use to sustain life. You cast [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) on the triggering target.

Instead of its normal effects, the [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) spell reduces the triggering damage by an amount equal to the Hit Points a 1-action [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) spell of that level would have recovered.

As usual, if this reduces the damage to 0, it might also remove additional effects of the triggering attack, such as injury poisons.
