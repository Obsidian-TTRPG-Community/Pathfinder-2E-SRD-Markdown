# Confounding Image  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](compendium/feats/spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [mirror image](compendium/spells/mirror-image.md)

When you cast [mirror image](compendium/spells/mirror-image.md), you can modify its duration to be sustained up to 1 minute and modify its range to 30 feet. If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You create an illusory duplicate of yourself that appears in an unoccupied square within range. The image takes up space and has a reach of 5 feet, and your allies can flank with the image. It doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have other than an AC equal to your spell DC and saving throw modifiers equal to your spell DC â€“ 10. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, or if you ever move more than 30 feet from it, the spell ends. Creatures can move through its space without hindrance. When you [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), you can move the image to an unoccupied square within range.
