# Sacral Monarch  *Feat 14*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sacral Lord](compendium/feats/sacral-lord-da.md), master in [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion)

You have come into your full powers and are truly a monarch of your realm, by your own definition at least. While in your territory, you can cast [banishment](compendium/spells/banishment.md) and inevitable disaster (Secrets of Magic 111) as innate divine spells, each once per day.
