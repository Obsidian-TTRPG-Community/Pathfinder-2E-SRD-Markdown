# Seedpod  *Feat 1*  
[leshy](rules/traits/leshy-b1.md "Leshy Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your body produces a nearly endless supply of hard seedpods. You gain a seedpod ranged unarmed attack with a range increment of 10 feet that deals `1d4` bludgeoning damage; these [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) have the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") trait. On a critical hit, a seedpod bursts, issuing forth a tangle of vegetation that imposes a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty on the target's Speed for 1 round. Seedpods do not add critical specialization effects.
