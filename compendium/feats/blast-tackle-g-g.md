# Blast Tackle  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 14*  
[gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: way of the vanguard
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a two-handed crossbow or a firearm that has the kickback or scatter trait.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You throw yourself at an enemy, bracing your weapon against it and pulling it close before releasing a destructive shot. Attempt to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md); if you're wielding your weapon in both hands, you [Release](rules/actions/release.md) one hand to do so. If your [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) succeeds, you can immediately [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) the target of the [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) with the required weapon, even if it's a two-handed weapon you're holding in one hand. This [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) deals an additional `3d6` precision damage.

As long the creature remains [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained), you can use just one hand to reload the weapon and [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that creature with it.
