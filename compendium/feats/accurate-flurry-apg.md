# Accurate Flurry  *Feat 20*  
[ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Impossible Flurry](compendium/feats/impossible-flurry.md)
- **Requirements**: You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.

You refine the precision of your unbelievable storm of blows. When you perform an [Impossible Flurry](compendium/feats/impossible-flurry.md), your first attack with each weapon instead takes the multiple attack penalty as though you had already made one attack this turn. All subsequent attacks take the maximum multiple attack penalty, as though you had already made two or more attacks this turn.
