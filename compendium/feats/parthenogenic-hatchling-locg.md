# Parthenogenic Hatchling  *Feat 1*  
[lizardfolk](rules/traits/lizardfolk-b1.md "Lizardfolk Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You were hatched from an unfertilized egg during hard times for your people, and you are a biological copy of your mother. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases. Each of your successful saving throws against a disease reduces its stage by 2, or by 1 for a virulent disease. Each critical success against an ongoing disease reduces its stage by 3, or by 2 for a virulent disease. You take damage only every 2 hours from thirst and every 2 days from starvation, rather than every hour and every day.

**Special.** You can take this feat only at 1st level.
