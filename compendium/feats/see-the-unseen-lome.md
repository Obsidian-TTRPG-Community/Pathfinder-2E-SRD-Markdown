# See The Unseen  *Feat 13*  
[goloma](rules/traits/goloma-lome.md)  


You notice things that others can't see at all. While you're adjacent to an [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) creature of your level or lower, it is instead only [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from you. You only need a successful DC 5 flat check to target a [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) creature.
