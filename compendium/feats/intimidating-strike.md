- **Activity** Two-Action

Your blow not only wounds creatures but also shatters their confidence. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). If you hit and deal damage, the target is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened), or [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical hit.
