# Dragon's Presence  *Feat 1*  
[kobold](rules/traits/kobold-b1.md "Kobold Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


As a member of dragonkind, you project unflappable confidence (that collapses catastrophically against the deadliest foes)

When you roll a success on a saving throw against a [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effect, you get a critical success instead. When you roll a failure against a [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effect, you get a critical failure instead.

In addition, when you attempt to [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) a foe of your level or lower, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check.
