# Woodworker  *Feat 1*  
ardande  


Denizens of the Plane of Wood take immense pride in the magnificent works of art they can craft from wood, and practicing your own woodcraft helps you feel a connection with your planar heritage. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting). If you would automatically become trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [Specialty Crafting](compendium/feats/specialty-crafting.md) skill feat for woodworking.
