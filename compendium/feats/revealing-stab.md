# Revealing Stab  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a melee weapon that deals piercing damage.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You drive your piercing weapon into an imperceptible foe, revealing its location to your allies. Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the required melee weapon. You don't have to attempt a flat check to hit a [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) creature, and you have to succeed at only a DC 5 flat check to target a [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) creature. If you hit and deal damage, you can drive the required weapon into a corporeal target, revealing its current position. You [Release](rules/actions/release.md) the weapon, and it becomes lodged in the target. If the target is [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed), other creatures don't need to succeed at a flat check to hit it. If the target is [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden), other creatures have to succeed at only a DC 5 flat check to target it. The creatures need to be able to see your weapon to gain any of these benefits, and the target can't become [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) to anyone who sees your weapon. If the target is [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), the weapon remains visible while lodged in it.
