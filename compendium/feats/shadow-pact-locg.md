# Shadow Pact  *Feat 13*  
[human](rules/traits/human.md "Human Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Nidalese ethnicity

Thousands of years ago, your ancestors made a pact with Zon-Kuthon. He has not forgotten, even if you might wish he had. You can take 1 damage to mix blood and shadows to cast 5th-level [creation](compendium/spells/creation.md) as an innate divine spell. You can use this ability as often as you wish, but you can have only one such object in existence at a time. If the object encounters bright light, the spell ends and the object dissolves into shadows.
