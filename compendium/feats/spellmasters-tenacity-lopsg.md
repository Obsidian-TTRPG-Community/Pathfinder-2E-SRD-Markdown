# Spellmaster's Tenacity  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellmaster's Resilience](compendium/feats/spellmasters-resilience-locg.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You critically fail at a saving throw against a foe's spell, and that spell was cast or created with the tradition of magic you selected with the Spellmaster's Resilience feat.
- **Activity** Reaction

You call upon the power of your spells to protect you from the worst of the magic headed your way. You fail your saving throw instead of critically failing. For 1 minute, increase the circumstance bonus to saving throws from the Spellmaster's Resilience feat to +2, and increase the resistance to damage it grants to 10.
