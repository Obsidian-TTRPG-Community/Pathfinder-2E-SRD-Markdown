# Risky Surgery  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine)

Your surgery can bring a patient back from the brink of death, but might push them over the edge. When you [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md), you can deal `1d8` slashing damage to your patient just before applying the effects of [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md). If you do, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check to [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md), and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
