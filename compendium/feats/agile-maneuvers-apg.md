[swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md "Swashbuckler Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics)

Your easily maneuver against your foes. Your [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md), and [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) actions have a lower multiple attack penalty: –4 instead of –5 if they're the second attack on your turn, or –8 instead of –10 if they're the third or subsequent attack on your turn.
