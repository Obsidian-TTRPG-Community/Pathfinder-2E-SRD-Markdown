# Protect Ally  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Swordmaster Dedication](compendium/feats/swordmaster-dedication-locg.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You place your body between your friends and your enemies, protecting your allies against oncoming attacks. You choose one adjacent ally. That ally gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn or until that ally is no longer adjacent to you, whichever comes first. You can only protect a single ally in this way. If you choose to Protect a different Ally, the previous ally loses the bonus to AC.
