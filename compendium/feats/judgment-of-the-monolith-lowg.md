# Judgment Of The Monolith  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ka Stone Ritual](compendium/feats/ka-stone-ritual-lowg.md)

You can use the oaths bound in your ka stone to compel the truth from the living and the dead. You can activate your ka stone to target a single living creature, causing that creature to experience the effects of being in a [zone of truth](compendium/spells/zone-of-truth.md). You can also activate it with a 10-minute activation (envision) to cast [talking corpse](compendium/spells/talking-corpse.md).
