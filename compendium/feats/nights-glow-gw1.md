# Night's Glow  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Oatia Skysage Dedication](compendium/feats/oatia-skysage-dedication-gw1.md)

The stars and moon lend you their light. You gain your choice of the moonbeam or zenith star (Lost Omens Gods & Magic 117) domain spell. Like your Oatia skysage spells, you cast this focus spell as an occult spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover by using the [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) to reflect upon or gaze at the stars.

**Special.** You can take this feat a second time, gaining the focus spell that you didn't gain the first time. Increase the number of Focus Points in your pool by 1.

## Night's Glow leads to...
