# Great Boaster  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Charisma 16, [Firebrand Braggart Dedication](compendium/feats/firebrand-braggart-dedication-locg.md)

Your bragging is particularly effective. If you succeed at a boast, you can attempt a great boast about that same skill by using your Firebrand Braggart Dedication action about the same action during the duration of your original boast's circumstance bonus; this is an exception to the rule that you can't make another boast about the same action until your next daily preparations. A great boast uses the Firebrand Braggart Dedication action (page 74), except that if you succeed, your circumstance bonus increases to +2 and remains for 1 hour. If you fail the great boast, you take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attempt the same action for 4 hours. Once you declare a great boast about a particular action, you can't declare a great boast about the same action until the next time you make daily preparations, regardless of whether you succeed or fail at the check. The minimum challenging task for a great boast is one with at least a hard DC for your level.
