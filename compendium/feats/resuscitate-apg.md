# Resuscitate  [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 16*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [healing](rules/traits/healing.md "Healing Effect Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Medic Dedication](compendium/feats/medic-dedication-apg.md), legendary in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine)
- **Requirements**: You are holding healer's tools or are wearing them and have a hand free.
- **Activity** Three-Action

You can use [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) to resuscitate the dead. Attempt a DC 40 [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of [raise dead](compendium/spells/raise-dead.md), except it still has the [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition it had before [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying), increased by 1 (or [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) if it wasn't [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) before [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying)). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day.
