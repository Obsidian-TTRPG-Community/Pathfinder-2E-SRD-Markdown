# Solar Detonation  [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 8*  
[fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [impulse](rules/traits/impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait")  [kineticist](rules/traits/kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [overflow](rules/traits/overflow-roe.md "Overflow Action & Ability Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  vitality  

- **Activity** Three-Action

Blinding flames explode in a swirling sphere! The detonation fills a 20-foot burst within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the area takes `6d6` fire damage, plus `2d6` vitality damage if it has void healing, and can become [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) or [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) depending on the result of its Reflex save. The light from Solar Detonation is sunlight for creatures with a particular vulnerability to sunlight.

Each creature that attempts a save becomes temporarily immune to being [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) or [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by Solar Detonation for 10 minutes, but not the impulse's other effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage and is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until the start of your next turn.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) until the start of your next turn.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 minute. Level (+2) Increase the fire damage by `1d6` and the vitality damage by `1d6`.
