# Quicksoul  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  talos  


The elemental metal in your bloodline literally courses through your veins in the form of liquid metals like mercury, rubidium, gallium, and djezet, giving your actions a languid fluidity. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics).

If you would automatically become trained in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. As these metals are largely toxic to organic life, you also gain the Toxic Touch action.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Toxic Touch** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") ([poison](rules/traits/poison.md))

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Requirements**: Your most recent action was to [Tumble Through](rules/actions/tumble-through.md), and you successfully moved through an enemy's space

**Effect** Make a melee unarmed [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the enemy whose space you moved through. On a hit, the target takes `1d6` [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) (or takes `2d6` [persistent poison](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) on a critical hit).
