# Battleforger  *Feat 9*  
[dwarf](rules/traits/dwarf.md "Dwarf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

You can sharpen weapons, polish armor, and apply special techniques to temporarily gain better effects from your armaments. By spending 1 hour working on a weapon or armor, you can grant it the effects of a +1 potency rune until your next daily preparations, gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls for a weapon or increasing armor's item bonus to AC by 1. This has no effect if the weapon or armor already had a potency rune.
