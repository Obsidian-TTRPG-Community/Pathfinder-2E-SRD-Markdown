# Kneecap  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 5*  
[goblin](rules/traits/goblin.md "Goblin Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You deliver a punishing blow to an enemy's knee, shin, or other vulnerable anatomy within your reach. Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with one of your melee weapons or melee unarmed attacks.

This attack doesn't deal damage. On a hit, the target takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed or a –15-foot status penalty on a critical hit. The penalty lasts for 1 round. This penalty applies only if the target has a land Speed and depends on legs or other targetable appendages to use its land Speed. As with all penalties to Speed, this can't reduce a creature's Speed below 5 feet.
