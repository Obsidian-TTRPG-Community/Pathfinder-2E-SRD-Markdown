- **Prerequisites**: Maestro muse
- **Activity** Single Action

You can perform multiple compositions simultaneously. If your next action is to cast a composition, it becomes a harmonized composition. Unlike a normal composition, a harmonized composition doesn't end if you cast another composition, and you can cast another composition on the same turn as a harmonized one. Casting another harmonized composition ends any harmonized composition you have in effect.

## Harmonize leads to...

[Symphony Of The Muse](compendium/feats/symphony-of-the-muse.md)
