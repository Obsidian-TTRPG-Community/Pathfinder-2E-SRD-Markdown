# Leave An Opening  *Feat 14*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  


When you hit hard enough, you leave an opening so your ally can jump in on the action. Whenever you critically hit a [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) opponent with a melee attack and deal damage, the target triggers an [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md) reaction from one ally of your choice who has that reaction, as if the enemy had used a [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") action.
