# Pristine Weapon  *Feat 10*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Verdant Weapon](compendium/feats/verdant-weapon-apg.md)

Your verdant weapon can cut through the resistances of magical creatures. The weapon is treated as cold iron and silver. If you critically hit a creature that has a weakness to cold iron or silver, the target takes `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) as the primal energies within your weapon slow its natural healing.
