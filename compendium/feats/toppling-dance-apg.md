# Toppling Dance  *Feat 13*  
[halfling](rules/traits/halfling.md "Halfling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dance Underfoot](compendium/feats/dance-underfoot-apg.md)

While sharing a creature's space using Dance Underfoot, your weapons and unarmed attacks gain the [trip](rules/traits/trip.md "Trip Weapon Trait") trait, but only against the creature whose space you share. You can be in the same space as a Large or larger [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) creature, even if it's not your ally.
