# Skull Creeper  *Feat 1*  
[ratfolk](rules/traits/ratfolk-b1.md "Ratfolk Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You wear skulls to demoralize foes. You become trained in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) and gain the [Intimidating Glare](compendium/feats/intimidating-glare.md) skill feat. If you're already trained in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. If you pay 50 gp for a splendid skull mask, the mask grants you a +1 item bonus to [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation); its usage is worn (mask).
