[suli](rules/traits/suli-b2.md "Suli Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  


You have power connected to the powerful jann amirs. You can cast [read omens](compendium/spells/read-omens.md) and 4th-level [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md) each once per day as arcane innate spells, and you can cast [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) at will as an arcane innate cantrip, heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
