# Paralyzing Slash  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md)  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [occult](rules/traits/occult.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Feverish Enzymes](compendium/feats/feverish-enzymes-botd.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

Your enzymes can paralyze your foes rather than merely making it harder for them to heal their wounds. [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with your claw or jaws. If you hit a living non-[elf](rules/traits/elf.md) creature, it becomes [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Regardless of the result of the save, the creature is temporarily immune to Paralyzing Slash for 24 hours. A creature that becomes [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) can attempt a new save to end the paralysis at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.
