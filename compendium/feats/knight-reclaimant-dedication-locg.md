# Knight Reclaimant Dedication  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) and [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth), any non-evil alignment, member of the Knights of Lastwall of knight rank

You have sworn the Crimson Oath and become a full member of the Crimson Reclaimers. You gain expert proficiency in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) and [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival). Whenever you roll a success on a saving throw against an undead's special ability, you get a critical success instead. This applies to any abilities that come from being undead, including an undead's innate spells (but not its prepared or spontaneous spells).

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Knight Reclaimant archetype.
