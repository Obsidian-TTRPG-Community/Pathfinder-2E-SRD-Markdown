# School Counterspell  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Counterspell, [Runelord Dedication](compendium/feats/runelord-dedication-som.md)

Your intricate knowledge of your school lets you easily negate spells from that school. Instead of being able to counter a foe's spell with Counterspell only if you have the same spell prepared, if the foe casts a spell from the school matching your specialization, you can Counterspell it with any other spell of the same school.
