# Target Of Opportunity  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Marshal Dedication](compendium/feats/marshal-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** An ally succeeds at a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against an opponent within your weapon's first range increment.
- **Requirements**: You have a ranged or thrown weapon in hand.
- **Activity** Reaction

You capitalize on your ally's attack to create a coordinated barrage. Make a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a â€“2 penalty against the opponent targeted by the triggering attack. This [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). If this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) is successful, combine the damage from the attack with the damage from your ally's attack for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.
