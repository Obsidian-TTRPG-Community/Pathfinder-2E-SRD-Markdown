- **Activity** Two-Action

Roots and branches of living wood writhe in elemental fire at your command, forming a bonfire fearsome enough to scare off predators in the night. You conjure a bonfire in an unoccupied 10-foot-square space within 30 feet. The bonfire burns for 10 hours, providing all the benefits of a normal campfire. If you use this impulse again, any previous one ends.

When you make a wood ranged [Elemental Blast](rules/actions/elemental-blast-roe.md), you can have it come from the bonfire instead of you, flinging burning logs. This blast deals an additional `1d6` fire damage. Each time you do this, the size of the bonfire is reduced by one 5-foot square. If all the squares are removed, the impulse ends.
