# Revivifying Mutagen  *Feat 2*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md)  


While under the effect of a mutagen, you can metabolize that mutagen's power to heal yourself. This uses a single action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md) and [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md) traits. Once the action is complete, you regain `1d6` Hit Points for every 2 item levels of the mutagen (minimum `1d6`), but the mutagen's duration immediately ends, even if you are under the effect of [Persistent Mutagen](compendium/feats/persistent-mutagen.md).
