[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cavalier Dedication](compendium/feats/cavalier-dedication-apg.md)

You've trained your mount to become a powerful force on the battlefield. The mount you gained through the [Cavalier Dedication](compendium/feats/cavalier-dedication-apg.md) feat becomes a mature animal companion, granting it additional capabilities. During an encounter, even if you don't use the [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) action, your animal companion can still use 1 action on your turn to [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) or [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
