# Thunder Clap  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Powder Punch Stance](compendium/feats/powder-punch-stance-ooa1.md)
- **Requirements**: You're in [Powder Punch Stance](compendium/feats/powder-punch-stance-ooa1.md).
- **Activity** Two-Action

You slam your hands together to unleash a deafening blast. Creatures in a 15-foot cone take `3d6` sonic damage, with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC.

Creatures that critically fail their save are also [deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 minute. You can't use this ability again for `1d4` rounds as your hands recover from the thunderous vibrations. At 8th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage from Thunder Clap increases by `1d6`.
