# Different Worlds  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: ability to select ancestry feats from multiple ancestries

Your separate experiences in different societies have evolved into entirely separate lives. Create a second identity for yourself with a different name, history, and background. This identity must correspond to one of the ancestries whose ancestry feats you can select. You gain the trained proficiency rank in the [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill from the second background you chose (but you don't gain any of the background's other benefits), and you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks when making a statement that would be true of your second identity or when disguising yourself as your second identity.
