# Emerald Boughs Hideaway  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](compendium/feats/magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), Emerald Boughs affiliation

You use Emerald Bough techniques to create a small extradimensional space called a hideaway that lasts as long as you are conscious. The hideaway functions as a type I bag of holding, but has no Bulk and takes no hands; it holds one object with a maximum Bulk equal to your highest mental ability score modifier; as you open the hideaway with pure thought, activating it to retrieve an item is a free action with the envision component instead of a single action with the [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) component. The hideaway's access point appears as an obviously magical gap within 1 foot of your body. Only you can access the hideaway; you can you use an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action each round to physically hold it open for another person. A successful [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell or similar effect against your spell DC and the hideaway's counteract level of 2 expels the object; the object is also expelled if you become [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). After a successful [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell or when you become conscious again, the hideaway immediately reforms with no additional action from you. You can also dismiss the hideaway (if it is empty) or re-form it using a single action with the envision component.
