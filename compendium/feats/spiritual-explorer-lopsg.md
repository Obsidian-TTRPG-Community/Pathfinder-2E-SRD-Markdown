[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")

Even if you aren't [Searching](rules/actions/search.md) in exploration mode, you can attempt a check to find haunts that normally require you to [Search](rules/actions/search.md) for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to find a particular haunt.
