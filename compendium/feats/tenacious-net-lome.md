[grippli](rules/traits/grippli-b2.md "Grippli Ancestry & Heritage Trait")

After a creature you [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) with a net [Escapes](rules/actions/escape.md) or Forces Open the net, stray strands of the net cling to the creature, causing them to remain [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the beginning of their next turn.
