# Showstopper  *Feat 14*  
[gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pistol Twirl](compendium/feats/pistol-twirl-g-g.md), master in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception)

Your twirling weapons create a grand distraction that's difficult to look away from.

When using Pistol Twirl to [Feint](rules/actions/feint.md), you can target all enemies within your weapon's first range increment who you can perceive and who can see you. You roll one [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check and compare it against each target's [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC.
