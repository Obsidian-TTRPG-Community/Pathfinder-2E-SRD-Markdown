# Topple Giants  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Overwatch Dedication](compendium/feats/overwatch-dedication-g-g.md)

When you observe an ally try and fail to execute a strategic maneuver against your enemies, you coordinate with your other allies to finish the job, using the opening from the first attempt to keep your foe off-balance and ensure your eventual success.

When an ally within your overwatch field attempts to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md), [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md), or [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) an opponent within your overwatch field and fails, you coordinate efforts to provide a +2 circumstance bonus to the next [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check rolled by a different ally to attempt the same action on the same target before that target's next turn.
