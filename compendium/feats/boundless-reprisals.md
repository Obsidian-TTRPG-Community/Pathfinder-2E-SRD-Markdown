# Boundless Reprisals  *Feat 20*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  


With a sixth sense for the flow of combat, you can quickly react to any situation as required. At the start of each enemy's turn, you gain a reaction you can use only during that turn for any reaction from a fighter feat or class feature.
