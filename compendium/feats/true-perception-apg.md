# True Perception  *Feat 19*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [revelation](rules/traits/revelation.md "Revelation Effect Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception)

Your perceptive abilities and ability to process sensory information are so far beyond the pale that you notice minute discrepancies in all sorts of illusions and transmutations. You are constantly under the effects of a 6th-level [true seeing](compendium/spells/true-seeing.md) spell, using your [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) modifier for the counteract check.
