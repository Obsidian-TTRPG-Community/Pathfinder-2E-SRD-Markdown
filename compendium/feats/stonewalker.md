# Stonewalker  *Feat 9*  
[dwarf](rules/traits/dwarf.md "Dwarf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You have a deep reverence for and connection to stone. You gain [meld into stone](compendium/spells/meld-into-stone.md) as a 3rd-level divine innate spell that you can cast once per day.

If you have the [Stonecunning](compendium/feats/stonecunning.md) dwarf ancestry feat, you can attempt to find unusual stonework and stonework traps that require legendary proficiency in [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception). If you have both Stonecunning and legendary proficiency in [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception), when you're not [Seeking](rules/actions/seek.md) and the GM rolls a secret check for you to notice unusual stonework, you keep the bonus from Stonecunning and don't take the â€“2 circumstance penalty.

## Stonewalker leads to...
