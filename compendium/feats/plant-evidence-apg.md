[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pickpocket](compendium/feats/pickpocket.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You can put a single item you're holding of light or negligible Bulk onto a person without them noticing by succeeding at a [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check against their [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC. If you have the ruffian racket, you can do this as a free action when you successfully [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) a target.
