# Poultice Preparation  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Herbalist Dedication](compendium/feats/herbalist-dedication-apg.md)

When you create an herbal elixir, you can prepare it as a poultice instead. A poultice gains the [oil](rules/traits/oil.md) trait (but remains alchemical, not magical) and loses the [elixir](rules/traits/elixir.md) and [ingested](rules/traits/ingested.md) traits. You can apply a poultice by Interacting with one hand.

When you apply a poultice, in addition to the item's normal effects, the recipient can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of [persistent acid, bleed, or fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.
