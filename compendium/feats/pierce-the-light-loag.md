# Pierce The Light  *Feat 17*  
[fetchling](rules/traits/fetchling-b2.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  


You tear the veil between the Material Plane and its shadow. You can cast [plane shift](compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) twice per week as an occult innate spell that can only target yourself; you can travel only to the Material or Shadow Planes, and your body serves as the focus component.
