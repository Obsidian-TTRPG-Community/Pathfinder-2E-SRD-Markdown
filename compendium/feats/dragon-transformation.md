- **Prerequisites**: dragon instinct, [Dragon's Rage Wings](compendium/feats/dragons-rage-wings.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You transform into a ferocious Large dragon, gaining the effects of 6th-level [dragon form](compendium/spells/dragon-form.md) except that you use your own AC and attack modifier; you also apply your extra damage from [Rage](rules/actions/rage.md), and the Breath Weapon uses your class DC. The action to [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the transformation gains the [rage](rules/traits/rage.md) trait.

At 18th level, you gain a +20-foot status bonus to your fly Speed, your damage bonus with dragon [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) increases to +12, and you gain a +14 status bonus to your breath weapon damage.
