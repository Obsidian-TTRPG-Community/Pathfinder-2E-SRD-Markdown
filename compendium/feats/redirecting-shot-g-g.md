# Redirecting Shot  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 10*  
[fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** An ally misses with a ranged attack that uses a thrown weapon or ammunition.
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
- **Activity** Reaction

Seeing your ally's attack about to go astray, you fire your weapon to right its course.

Discharge your firearm and roll a d20. Your ally uses this roll instead of their own, and the attack ignores bonuses the target would gain against the attack from lesser or standard cover.
