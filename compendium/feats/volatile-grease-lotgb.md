# Volatile Grease  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](compendium/feats/spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [grease](compendium/spells/grease.md)

When you cast [grease](compendium/spells/grease.md), you can modify its target to be 1 creature. If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You splash the target with combustible grease. The target must attempt a Reflex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is splattered with grease and gains weakness 2 to fire until the end of your next turn. The target or an adjacent creature can rub off the combustible grease with an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action, ending the effect.
> - **Failure** As success, except the weakness to fire lasts for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+2)** The weakness increases by 1.
