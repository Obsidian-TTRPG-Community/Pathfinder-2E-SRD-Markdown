# Flexible Studies  *Feat 1*  
[investigator](rules/traits/investigator-apg.md "Investigator Class Trait")  


You've collected a cross-section of information on various disciplines you can refer to when preparing for various tasks.

During your daily preparations, you can cram on a certain subject to become temporarily trained in one skill of your choice. This proficiency lasts until you prepare again. As this proficiency is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent character option like a feat.
