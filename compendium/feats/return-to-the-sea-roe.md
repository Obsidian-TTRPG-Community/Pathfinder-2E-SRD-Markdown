- **Activity** Two-Action

You adapt a creature to living and moving in water. Target a willing creature within 30 feet. For 10 minutes, it gains the effects of a [feet to fins](compendium/spells/feet-to-fins.md) spell, can breathe water, and gets a +1 status bonus to AC and saves against any creature with the amphibious, [aquatic](rules/traits/aquatic-b1.md "Aquatic Creature Trait"), or [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") trait. In addition, its attacks ignore the effects water normally has on bludgeoning and slashing attacks. If you use Return to the Sea again, any existing one ends.
