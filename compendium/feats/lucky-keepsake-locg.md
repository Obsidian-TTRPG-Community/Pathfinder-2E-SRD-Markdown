# Lucky Keepsake  *Feat 9*  
[leshy](rules/traits/leshy-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Leshy Superstition](compendium/feats/leshy-superstition-locg.md)

You have a keepsake that grants you luck. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against spells and [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) effects at all times, not just when you use Leshy Superstition. If you lose the keepsake, you lose the bonus until you designate a new keepsake, typically over the course of a week.
