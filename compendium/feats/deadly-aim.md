# Deadly Aim  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[open](rules/traits/open.md "Open Combat Trait")  [ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md "Ranger Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: weapon specialization
- **Activity** Single Action

You aim for your prey's weak spots, making your shot more challenging but dealing more damage if you hit. Make a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against your hunted prey at a â€“2 penalty. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to damage on that [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). This bonus increases to +6 at 11th level and +8 at 15th level.
