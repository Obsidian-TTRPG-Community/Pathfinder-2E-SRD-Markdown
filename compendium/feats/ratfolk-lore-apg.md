# Ratfolk Lore  *Feat 1*  
[ratfolk](rules/traits/ratfolk-b1.md "Ratfolk Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Years of experience among ratfolk communities have made you nimble, and you've learned to run and hide when enemies threaten. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) and [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Ratfolk Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).
