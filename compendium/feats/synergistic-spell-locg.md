# Synergistic Spell  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 20*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Halcyon Spellcasting Initiate](compendium/feats/halcyon-spellcasting-initiate-locg.md), [Fulminating Synergy](compendium/feats/fulminating-synergy-locg.md), legendary in [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) and [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature)
- **Activity** Single Action

You combine your synergy and spells into a fantastic web of magic, allowing you to cast two spells at once. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from one of your halcyon spell slots, after that spell resolves, you can [Cast another Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) as a free action. This spell must be cast from one of your halcyon spell slots and be a spell that would normally take two actions to cast.
