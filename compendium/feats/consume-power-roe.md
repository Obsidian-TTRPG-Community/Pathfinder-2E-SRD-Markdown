# Consume Power  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[impulse](rules/traits/impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](rules/traits/kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [metal](rules/traits/metal-roe.md "Metal Energy & Element Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Trigger** You would take acid, electricity, fire, or sonic damage.
- **Activity** Reaction

You absorb energy and hold it in your kinetic gate. You gain resistance equal to your level to the triggering damageâ€”choose one eligible type of resistance. If this reaction prevents any damage, you gain a status bonus equal to half your level to the damage roll of the next metal impulse you use before the end of your next turn.
