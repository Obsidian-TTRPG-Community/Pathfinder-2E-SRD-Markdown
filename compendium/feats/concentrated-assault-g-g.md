# Concentrated Assault  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sniping Duo Dedication](compendium/feats/sniping-duo-dedication-g-g.md)

You and your spotter combine your efforts to bring down your target. If you and your spotter both use the [Ready](rules/actions/ready.md) activity to make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the same opponent and choose the same trigger for the readied action, resolve your attacks at the same time. Each of you can use the higher of the two attack rolls for your [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), each using your own modifier; this is a [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait") effect. If both attacks are successful, total the damage for both attacks for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.
