[ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md "Ranger Class Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

By pointing out vulnerabilities, you grant the benefits listed in [Hunt Prey](rules/actions/hunt-prey.md) and your hunter's edge benefit to an ally until the end of their next turn. Depending on whether you call out or use gestures, this action gains either the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") or [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") trait.

## Warden's Boon leads to...

[Shared Prey](compendium/feats/shared-prey.md), [Triple Threat](compendium/feats/triple-threat.md)
