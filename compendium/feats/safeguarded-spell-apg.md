[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md "Sorcerer Class Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You bring the magical wavelengths of your spell into sync with the ones produced by your own body. If the next action you take is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with an area, you aren't affected by the spell even if you are within the area.
