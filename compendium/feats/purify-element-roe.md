- **Activity** Two-Action

You turn an element into its purest form. Choose one of your kinetic elements and target up to 1 cubic foot of that element within 30 feet. (One cubic foot of liquid is roughly 8 gallons.) You remove toxins and pollutants from the element as well as anything intruding into the element, such as plant roots in soil. This can't change the grade of a material, alter the form of a manufactured object, or change the structural integrity of the element. If the purification would remove an alchemical or magical pollutant (such as a poison or curse), Purify Element attempts to counteract that impurity, using your class DC â€” 10 for the counteract check. If it fails to counteract a particular impurity, any further attempt you make to counteract that impurity with Purify Element fails as well.
