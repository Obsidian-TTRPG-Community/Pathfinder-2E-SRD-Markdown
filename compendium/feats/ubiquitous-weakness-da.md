# Ubiquitous Weakness  *Feat 20*  
[manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [thaumaturge](rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md "Thaumaturge Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Share Weakness

You've nurtured your bonds with your comrades, allowing you to share the benefits of your esoterica. When you use [Exploit Vulnerability](rules/actions/exploit-vulnerability-da.md) and choose mortal weakness, select any number of allies within 30 feet of you. Their [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) apply the weakness from mortal weakness the same way your [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) do. This benefit ends when you stop benefiting from [Exploit Vulnerability](rules/actions/exploit-vulnerability-da.md). Since this effect depends on magically strengthening your bond to your allies, only allies with whom you've developed a rapport over the course of one or more days gain the benefit.
