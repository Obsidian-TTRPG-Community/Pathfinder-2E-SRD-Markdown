# Rope Runner  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pirate Dedication](compendium/feats/pirate-dedication-apg.md); trained in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) and [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics)

You run and climb across ropes and rigging almost as easily as on the ground. You gain a climb Speed of 15 feet, but only on ship's rigging or similar ropes. Whenever you succeed at an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md) a rope or an [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Balance](rules/actions/balance.md) on a rope, you get a critical success instead. You aren't [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) while [Climbing](rules/actions/climb.md) or [Balancing](rules/actions/balance.md) on a rope.
