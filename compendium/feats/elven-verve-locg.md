# Elven Verve  *Feat 1*  
[elf](rules/traits/elf.md "Elf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


While all elves are immune to the paralyzing touch of ghouls, you can shake off flesh-numbing magic of all kinds. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against effects that would impose the [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), or [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) conditions. When you would be [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), or [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for at least 2 rounds, reduce that duration by 1 round.
