# Ride  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  


When you [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) you're mounted on to take a [move](rules/traits/move.md "Move Combat Trait") action (such as [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md)), you automatically succeed instead of needing to attempt a check. Any animal you're mounted on acts on your turn, like a minion. If you [Mount](rules/actions/mount.md) an animal in the middle of an encounter, it skips its next turn and then acts on your next turn. Page 249 has more on [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md).
