# Aura Of Faith  *Feat 12*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of good

You radiate an aura of pure belief that imbues your attacks and those of nearby allies with holy power. Your [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) deal an extra 1 good damage against evil creatures. Also, each good-aligned ally within 15 feet gains this benefit on their first [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that hits an evil creature each round.
