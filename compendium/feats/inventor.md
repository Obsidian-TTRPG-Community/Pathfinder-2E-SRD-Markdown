# Inventor  *Feat 7*  
[downtime](rules/traits/downtime.md "Downtime Action & Ability Trait")  [general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

You are a genius at [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting), easily able to determine how things are made and create new inventions. You can spend downtime to invent a common formula that you don't know. This works just like the [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) activity: you spend half the Price of the formula up front, attempt a [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check, and on a success either finish the formula by paying the difference or work for longer to decrease the Price. The difference is that you spend the additional time in research, design, and development, rather than in creating an item. Once it's complete, you add the new formula you invented to your formula book.
