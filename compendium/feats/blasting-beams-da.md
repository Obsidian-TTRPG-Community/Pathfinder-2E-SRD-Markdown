# Blasting Beams  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[attack](rules/traits/attack.md)  [deviant](rules/traits/deviant-da.md)  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Requirements**: You have a free hand.
- **Activity** Single Action

A directed beam of heat or an arc of lightning is one of the simplest ways to project energy. You fire a blast or beam from one hand. Make an attack roll against a creature within 30 feet.

If you succeed, the beam deals `1d6` damage for every 2 levels you have to the target, or double damage on a critical success.

**Awakening** Your beams blast through targets. Instead of making an attack roll to damage a single creature within 30 feet, you can use Blasting Beams as a 2-action activity to damage all creatures in a 60-foot line, with a basic Reflex save.

**Awakening** You can choose to launch smaller, quicker beams from your eyes instead. These deal d4s instead of d6s, but the attack has the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md) trait, and you don't need a hand free to make it, though your eyes must be uncovered.
