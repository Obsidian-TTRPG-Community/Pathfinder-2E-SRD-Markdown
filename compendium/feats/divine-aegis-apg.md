# Divine Aegis  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 2*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md "Oracle Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") effect, but you haven't rolled yet.
- **Activity** Reaction

You summon divine energy to shield yourself, offering protection against other traditions but leaving you exposed to other [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait") effects. Until the beginning of your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against non-divine [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") effects, but you also take a â€“1 circumstance penalty to saves against [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait") effects.
