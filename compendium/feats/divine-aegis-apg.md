# Divine Aegis  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 2*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md)  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  

- **Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) effect, but you haven't rolled yet.
- **Activity** Reaction

You summon divine energy to shield yourself, offering protection against other traditions but leaving you exposed to other [divine](rules/traits/divine.md) effects. Until the beginning of your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against non-divine [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) effects, but you also take a â€“1 circumstance penalty to saves against [divine](rules/traits/divine.md) effects.
