# Standby Spell  *Feat 8*  
[magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md "Magus Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md)

You've honed one spell as your favored combat technique, and you've practiced it enough that you no longer need to prepare it to cast it. Choose a spell in your spellbook that you could use with [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) and that has a level no higher than the highest-level magus spell slot you have.

You can [Cast this Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) without having it prepared ahead of time by expending a spell slot of a sufficient level to cast your chosen spell. You can change this spell whenever you add new spells to your spellbook, or by studying your spellbook for 1 hour.
