# Caterwaul  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 13*  
[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [catfolk](rules/traits/catfolk-b1.md "Catfolk Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** An ally within 30 feet would be reduced to 0 HP but not immediately killed.
- **Activity** Reaction

You give a daring yowl in the face of adversity, calling your companion back from the brink of unconsciousness. Your ally isn't knocked out and remains at 1 Hit Point. Your ally's [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition still increases by 1 as though they had been [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) and recovered.
