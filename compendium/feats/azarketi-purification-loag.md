# Azarketi Purification  *Feat 9*  
[azarketi](rules/traits/azarketi-loag.md)  


You can cast [purify food and drink](compendium/spells/purify-food-and-drink.md) as a primal innate spell, but only on liquids.

You can cast this spell once every 10 minutes. You can also use your innate purify food and drink on a touched creature instead of a liquid to purify their blood, giving that creature a +2 status bonus for 1 minute on their ongoing saves against poisons already present in their body when you cast the spell.
