# Hilt Hammer  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Reclaimant Dedication](compendium/feats/knight-reclaimant-dedication-locg.md)

You know how to turn any weapon into a bone-crushing implement of skeletal destruction. Melee weapons you wield gain the versatile B trait. You can use the weapon only to deal bludgeoning damage when making melee attacks. At the GM's discretion, specific weapons might not be able to gain the versatile B trait.
