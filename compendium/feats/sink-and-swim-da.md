# Sink and Swim  *Feat 14*  
[aftermath](rules/traits/aftermath-da.md)  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  [water](rules/traits/water.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: You've been brought to 0 Hit Points by an enemy that has the [water](rules/traits/water.md) trait or an enemy's ability that has the [water](rules/traits/water.md) trait.

Your body looks like it's made of flowing water, clear and pristine, providing a natural grace to all your movements. You gain a swim Speed equal to your land Speed. If you already had a swim Speed, it's increased by 10 feet. You gain the Water Transfer activity, which enables you to teleport through a body of water.

**Effect** You sink into the water and emerge back onto land in another space within 120 feet that's adjacent to the same body of water. You can transport yourself, any items you're wearing and holding, and up to one other willing creature.
