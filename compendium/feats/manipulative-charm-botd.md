# Manipulative Charm  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Vampire Dedication, trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy)

Against humanoids, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks to [Lie](rules/actions/lie.md), and to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks to [Gather Information](rules/actions/gather-information.md) and [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md).

Once per day, you can cast [charm](compendium/spells/charm.md) as a divine innate spell using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") trait. At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened by an additional level, to a maximum of a 9th-level [charm](compendium/spells/charm.md) when you are 19th level.
