[emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation)
- **Activity** Single Action

You menace the target, stoking their fears and drawing their attention. Attempt an [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check against the Will DC of a target within 30 feet. If you succeed, for 1 minute, that target gains a +2 status bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks against you, but they take a â€“2 status penalty to Will saves against [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effects.
