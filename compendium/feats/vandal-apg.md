# Vandal  *Feat 5*  
[goblin](rules/traits/goblin.md "Goblin Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You have a knack for breaking and dismantling things. Putting them back together is the boring part, so you largely don't bother with that. You become trained in [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery). If you would automatically become trained in [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. In addition, whenever you hit with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a trap or an unattended object, you ignore the first 5 points of the object's Hardness.
