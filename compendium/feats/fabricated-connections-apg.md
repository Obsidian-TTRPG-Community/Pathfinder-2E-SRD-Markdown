# Fabricated Connections  *Feat 7*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dandy Dedication](compendium/feats/dandy-dedication-apg.md); master in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception)

You can lie about having taken an action so convincingly that you acquire all the tangible benefits of having successfully completed it. You can roll [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) in place of a different skill when attempting to [Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md), [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md), [Request](rules/actions/request.md), or [Subsist](rules/actions/subsist.md). You can use Fabricated Connections to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) or [Request](rules/actions/request.md) once per day, and you can also use it once per week to [Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md) or [Subsist](rules/actions/subsist.md).
