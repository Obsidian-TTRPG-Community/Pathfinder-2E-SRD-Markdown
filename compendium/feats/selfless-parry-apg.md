# Selfless Parry  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dueling Parry](compendium/feats/dueling-parry-apg.md), [Duelist Dedication](compendium/feats/duelist-dedication-apg.md)

You protect those near you with a flash of steel. When you're benefiting from Dueling Parry, allies adjacent to you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. If you have Dueling Riposte, you can use it when an enemy within your reach critically fails a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against an ally adjacent to you, not just against yourself.
