# Distracting Spellstrike  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md "Magus Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: laughing shadow hybrid study, [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md)
- **Requirements**: You're in [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md) stance and have a hand free.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You weave distracting magic with one hand to enhance your [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md). Make a [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) and [Feint](rules/actions/feint.md) against the target of your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). Do this immediately before making the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), but after choosing your target. The [Feint](rules/actions/feint.md) gains the [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait"), and [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") traits, and it always has the basic effects of a [Feint](rules/actions/feint.md), rather than applying any adjustments or alternate effects from other feats or abilities.
