# Inventor Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [multiclass](rules/traits/multiclass.md "Multiclass Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Intelligence 14

You become trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) and inventor class DC. You gain the [Inventor](compendium/feats/inventor.md) skill feat, even if you don't meet the skill feat's requirements. Choose an innovation. You gain that innovation, though you don't gain any other abilities that modify or use that innovation, such as modifications or [Explode](rules/actions/explode-g-g.md).

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have first gained two other feats from the inventor archetype.

## Inventor Dedication leads to...

[Basic Breakthrough](compendium/feats/basic-breakthrough-g-g.md), [Advanced Breakthrough](compendium/feats/advanced-breakthrough-g-g.md), [Basic Modification](compendium/feats/basic-modification-g-g.md), [Brilliant Crafter](compendium/feats/brilliant-crafter-g-g.md), [Explosion](compendium/feats/explosion-g-g.md)
