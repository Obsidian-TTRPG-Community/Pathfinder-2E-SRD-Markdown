# Furious Finish  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

Desperate to finish the fight, you pour all your rage into one final blow. Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). If it hits, you gain a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of rounds remaining in your [Rage](rules/actions/rage.md) (maximum 10). After this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), your [Rage](rules/actions/rage.md) immediately ends, and you are [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) until you rest for at least 10 minutes.
