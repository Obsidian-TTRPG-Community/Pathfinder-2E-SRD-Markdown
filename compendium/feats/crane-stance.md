# Crane Stance  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter the stance of a crane, holding your arms in an imitation of a crane's wings and using flowing, defensive motions. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC, but the only [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) you can make are crane wing attacks. These deal `1d6` bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait"), [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait"), [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait"), and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits.

While in Crane Stance, reduce the DC for [High Jump](rules/actions/high-jump.md) and [Long Jump](rules/actions/long-jump.md) by 5, and when you [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md), you can move an additional 5 feet horizontally or 2 feet vertically.
