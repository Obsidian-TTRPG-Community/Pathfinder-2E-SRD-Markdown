# Reach Beyond  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghost Eater Dedication](compendium/feats/ghost-eater-dedication-frp1.md)

You've learned to move your spiritual energy past yourself to attack spirits where others can't. You can make melee [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) against incorporeal creatures that are inside solid objects as long as the object is within your reach. An incorporeal creature inside of a solid object is [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden), requiring you to succeed at a DC 11 flat check when you target it. You can spend an action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait, to focus on a creature inside of a solid object. If you do, the next melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) you make this turn requires you to succeed at only a DC 6 flat check to affect the creature.
