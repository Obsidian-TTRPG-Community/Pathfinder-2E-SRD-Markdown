# Fade Away  *Feat 9*  
[halfling](rules/traits/halfling.md "Halfling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Easily Dismissed](compendium/feats/easily-dismissed-locg.md)

Your ability to blend into the background allows you to fade away entirely or appear innocuous even to [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") effects. You gain invisibility and misdirection as 2nd-level innate occult spells. You can target only yourself with invisibility, and you must be the primary target of misdirection. You can cast each spell once per day.
