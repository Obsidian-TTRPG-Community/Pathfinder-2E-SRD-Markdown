# Crystalline Cloud  *Feat 9*  
[aphorite](rules/traits/aphorite-loag.md "Aphorite Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Crystalline Dust](compendium/feats/crystalline-dust-loag.md)

When you use Crystalline Dust, you can spend one additional action to disperse the motes as a 10-foot-radius cloud centered on you instead of as haze; the activity gains the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait. All creatures within the cloud become [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed), and all creatures outside the cloud become [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to creatures within it.
