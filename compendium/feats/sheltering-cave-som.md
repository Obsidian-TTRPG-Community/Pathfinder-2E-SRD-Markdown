# Sheltering Cave  *Feat 4*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  [earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait")  [exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md "Exploration Action & Ability Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: stone order
- **Requirements**: You're standing on ground composed of earth, stone, or a similar material.

You spend 10 minutes communing with spirits of earth and stone, requesting shelter. At the end of this time, the earth rises and opens, forming a small cave or earthen mound 20 feet in diameter and 10 feet high. This cave has the [structure](rules/traits/structure.md "Structure General Trait") trait and the same restrictions as structures created by magic items. The cave has a single entrance and provides shelter from the elements. The cave remains for 12 hours or until you spend 10 minutes coaxing the earth to close.
