# Hag Claws  *Feat 1*  
[changeling](rules/traits/changeling-b1.md "Changeling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


When you came of age, your fingernails grew long and sharp.

You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals `1d4` slashing damage. Your claws are in the brawling group and have the agile, [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait"), and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits.

**Special.** Hag claws can develop at any point in a changeling's life, allowing you to select this feat anytime you would gain an ancestry feat, but once you've selected it, you can't retrain out of it.
