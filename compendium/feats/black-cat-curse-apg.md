[catfolk](rules/traits/catfolk-b1.md "Catfolk Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [misfortune](rules/traits/misfortune.md "Misfortune Effect Trait")  [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")

- **Trigger** A creature within 30 feet you can see would succeed at a save.
- **Activity** Reaction

You hiss a spiteful curse at the creature. The target must reroll the triggering saving throw and use the worse result.
