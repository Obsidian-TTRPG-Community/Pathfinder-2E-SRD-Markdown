# Burn It!  *Feat 1*  
[goblin](rules/traits/goblin.md "Goblin Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Fire fascinates you. Your spells and [alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait") items that deal fire damage gain a status bonus to damage equal to half the spell's level or one-quarter the item's level (minimum 1). You also gain a +1 status bonus to any [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) you deal.
