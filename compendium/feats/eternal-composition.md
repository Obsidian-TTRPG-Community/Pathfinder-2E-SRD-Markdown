# Eternal Composition  *Feat 18*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Maestro muse

The world is a stage upon which you are always playing. You are permanently [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened); you can use your extra action only to cast a composition cantrip that requires 1 action to cast. While in exploration mode, you can declare that you are performing an eligible composition cantrip while using any exploration tactic. Even before your first turn in a combat encounter, that cantrip is active as if you had cast it on your previous turn.
