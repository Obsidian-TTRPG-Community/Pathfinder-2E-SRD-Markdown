# Chance Death  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[duskwalker](rules/traits/duskwalker-apg.md "Duskwalker Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You would die as a result of a failed saving throw or recovery check.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your previous life ended due to sheer poor luck, struck by lightning or choking on a fish bone. You can reroll the triggering recovery check or saving throw, but you must use the new result, even if it's worse than the first roll.

**Special.** You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of this feat.
