# Phalanx Breaker  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: way of the vanguard
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a two-handed firearm or a two-handed crossbow.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You know that to take out an enemy formation, you must punch a hole through its center. Make a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the required weapon against a target within the weapon's first range increment. The target is pushed directly back 10 feet (20 feet on a critical hit), and if this pushes the target into an obstacle, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to half your level.
