# Sense The Unseen (Investigator)  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 14*  
[investigator](rules/traits/investigator-apg.md "Investigator Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** You fail a check to [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

When you look for foes, you notice the slightest of cues. Even though you failed at the triggering check, you automatically sense any [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) creatures in the area where you're Seeking, making them merely [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) to you.
