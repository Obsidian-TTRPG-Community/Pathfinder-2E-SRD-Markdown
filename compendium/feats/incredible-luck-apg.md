# Incredible Luck  *Feat 18*  
[fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md "Swashbuckler Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Charmed Life](compendium/feats/charmed-life-apg.md)

You always seem to bounce back from the worst. When you use Charmed Life, roll the save twice (including the +2 circumstance bonus from Charmed Life) and use the better result.
