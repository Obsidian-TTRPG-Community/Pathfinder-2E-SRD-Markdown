# Time Dilation Cascade  [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 20*

- **Activity** Three-Action

You borrow a bit of time from the future to act now. Make six [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md). Your multiple attack penalty applies normally to these [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md). If you successfully hit a creature with multiple [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), combine those [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md)' damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. On your next turn, you regain 1 action instead of 3. This is before any alteration in your actions due to the [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened), [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed), and [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) conditions.
