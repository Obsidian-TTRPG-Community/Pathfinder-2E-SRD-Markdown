[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hellknight Armiger Dedication](compendium/feats/hellknight-armiger-dedication-lowg.md)
- **Trigger** Your turn begins and you can observe a devil.
- **Activity** Free Action

Your Hellknight training drilled details of Hell's denizens deep into your mind. Make an attempt to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about a devil you're observing. If you roll a critical failure on this check, you get a failure instead.
