[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Wrestler Dedication](compendium/feats/wrestler-dedication-lotgb.md)
- **Trigger** A creature gives you the [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your ability to twist your opponents' bodies into painful locks and holds makes you particularly adept at escaping such predicaments. Attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) the triggering condition. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this check.
