# Round Ears  *Feat 1*  
[half-elf](rules/traits/half-elf.md "Half-Elf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your elven lineage is subtle enough that you look barely different from other humans, and you've learned to use that to your advantage. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) (or another skill of your choice, if you were already trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception))

You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) checks to pretend you aren't a halfelf.

Observers are never granted circumstance bonuses to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks due to you [Impersonating](rules/actions/impersonate.md) a full-blooded human, and you never take circumstance penalties due to you Impersonating a full-blooded human.

**Special.** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain out of this feat or into this feat.
