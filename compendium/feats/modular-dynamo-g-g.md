# Modular Dynamo  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sterling Dynamo Dedication](compendium/feats/sterling-dynamo-dedication-g-g.md)

Your dynamo has modular configurations, allowing you to swap between various different possibilities with ease in order to adapt to various situations in combat. Your dynamo attack gains the [modular](rules/traits/modular-logm.md "Modular Weapon Trait") trait (page 150), as well as one of the following configurations of your choice: power driver (`1d6` bludgeoning damage; shove), percussive striker (`1d4` bludgeoning damage; agile, finesse), rotating sickle (`1d6` slashing damage; trip), or entangling barbs (`1d6` piercing damage; grapple). If you have a manually controlled dynamo, these damage dice increase by 1 size, as usual, and you can also choose the extendable baton (`1d4` bludgeoning damage; finesse, reach), which has the damage increase already factored in.

When you use an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to switch configurations using the [modular](rules/traits/modular-logm.md "Modular Weapon Trait") trait, you switch between the initial configuration of dynamo you chose with the Sterling Dynamo Dedication and the new configuration you chose with Modular Dynamo.

**Special.** You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, you choose another configuration and add it to the list of options you can choose when you use an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action with the [modular](rules/traits/modular-logm.md "Modular Weapon Trait") trait.
