- **Activity** Two-Action

Intense cold swirls around your foe, covering it in frost that slows it down and turns its body to ice. Target a creature you can observe within 120 feet. It must attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC. The creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) until the end of its next turn.
> - **Failure** The target is frozen solid. It can't act, its AC is 9, it has Hardness 5, and it's immune to other [cold](rules/traits/cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait") effects, critical hits, and precision damage. This lasts until the end of your next turn, but if the target is affected by a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action, this effect ends immediately after that action.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but after becoming unfrozen, the creature is [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) until the end of its next turn.
