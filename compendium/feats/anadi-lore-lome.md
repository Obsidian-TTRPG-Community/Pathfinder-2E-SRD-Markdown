# Anadi Lore  *Feat 1*  
[anadi](rules/traits/anadi-lome.md "Anadi Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You've learned how to provide for your community, be it through hard-earned sustenance or useful crafts. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) and [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Anadi Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).
