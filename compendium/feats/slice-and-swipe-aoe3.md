# Slice And Swipe  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[flourish](rules/traits/flourish.md "Flourish Combat Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: Help either the Washboard Dogs or the Diobel
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a melee weapon that deals slashing damage and you have a free hand.
- **Activity** Single Action

You attempt a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the required weapon. If you hit and deal damage and the result of your attack roll exceeds the target's [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC, you [Steal](rules/actions/steal.md) a small object from the target (as if you had succeeded at that task using the [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) skill). Depending on the object, the target might realize that it has been stolen, and onlookers might realize you have stolen the object if the attack roll doesn't exceed their [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DCs.
