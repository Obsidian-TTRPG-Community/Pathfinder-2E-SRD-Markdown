# Hellspawn  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  [tiefling](rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md "Tiefling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your lineage descends from devils, the conniving schemers of Hell's malevolent hierarchy. You're as skilled at noticing lies and twisted wordings as you are at constructing them. You are trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) and [Legal Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore). If you were already trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also gain the [Lie to Me](compendium/feats/lie-to-me.md) skill feat.

## Hellspawn leads to...

[Devil Magic](compendium/feats/devil-magic-apg.md)
