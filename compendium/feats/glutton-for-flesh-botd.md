# Glutton for Flesh  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghoul Dedication](compendium/feats/ghoul-dedication-botd.md)

You have developed a capacity to store more flesh within your gaunt body to leave yourself satiated longer. If you Consume Flesh while satiated, you become fully satiated. You stay fully satiated for 3 hours, after which you become satiated for 1 hour. If you're fully satiated when an ability would end your satiation, you cease being fully satiated but remain satiated. If you have [Grave Strength](compendium/feats/grave-strength-botd.md), you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed when fully satiated instead of a +5-foot status bonus for being satiated.
