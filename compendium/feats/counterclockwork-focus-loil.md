# Counterclockwork Focus  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Shieldmarshal Dedication](compendium/feats/shieldmarshal-dedication-loil.md)
- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Activity** Single Action

You understand the need for law enforcement doctrine to adapt to the ever-changing innovations in technology and arcana. Your training in special weapons and tactics give you access to unusual techniques to respond to clockwork- and magic-related crimes. You apply special additives to a loaded firearm. On your next [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with that firearm before the end of your turn, you deal an additional `2d6` damage if the target is a [construct](rules/traits/construct.md "Construct Creature Type Trait"), and you can treat the ammunition as your choice of [cold iron](compendium/equipment/items/cold-iron.md) or [adamantine](compendium/equipment/items/adamantine.md). At 18th level, this additional damage increases to `3d6`, and you can choose to instead treat the ammunition as [orichalcum](compendium/equipment/items/orichalcum.md).
