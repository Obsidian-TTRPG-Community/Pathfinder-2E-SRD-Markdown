# Quick Jump  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics)

You can use [High Jump](rules/actions/high-jump.md) and [Long Jump](rules/actions/long-jump.md) as a single action instead of 2 actions. If you do, you don't perform the initial [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) (nor do you fail if you don't [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) 10 feet).
