# Spelunker  *Feat 1*  
[shisk](rules/traits/shisk-lome.md "Shisk Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Living underground, you have learned to find your way without landmarks or even solid ground. If you roll a success on an [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) check to [Sense Direction](rules/actions/sense-direction.md) or an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md), you get a critical success instead. You're not [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) when you attempt to [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md).
