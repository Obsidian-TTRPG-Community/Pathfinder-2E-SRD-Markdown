# Panache Paragon  *Feat 20*  
[swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md "Swashbuckler Class Trait")  


You find opportunities to perform stylish feats in the moments between others' heartbeats and eye blinks. You are permanently [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened). You can use the extra action only to [Tumble Through](rules/actions/tumble-through.md) or perform the skill action listed in your swashbuckler's style as one that allows you to gain panache, or other actions that would allow you to gain panache at the GM's discretion.
