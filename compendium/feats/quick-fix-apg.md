# Quick Fix  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Talisman Dabbler Dedication](compendium/feats/talisman-dabbler-dedication-apg.md)

You can attach a talisman using only a bit of glue and some string. You gain the [Rapid Affixture](compendium/feats/rapid-affixture-apg.md) skill feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites.

When you use it, you can affix or remove up to four talismans in 1 minute instead of just one.

You gain the ability to [Affix a Talisman](rules/actions/affix-a-talisman.md) as a 3-action activity from that feat at 12th level, regardless of your [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) proficiency.
