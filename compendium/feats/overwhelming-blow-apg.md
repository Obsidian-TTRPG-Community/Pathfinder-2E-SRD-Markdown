# Overwhelming Blow  [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 16*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Activity** Three-Action

You throw your weight into a powerful attack that leaves you vulnerable. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). This counts as three attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) hits, you get a critical hit. If you roll a critical hit, your attack also gains the [deadly <d12>](rules/traits/deadly.md) trait. Whether or not you hit, you become [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) and are [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of your next turn.
