# Rapid Mantel  *Feat 2*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics)

You easily pull yourself onto ledges. When you [Grab an Edge](rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md), you can pull yourself onto that surface and stand. You can use [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) instead of a Reflex save to [Grab an Edge](rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md).
