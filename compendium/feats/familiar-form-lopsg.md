# Familiar Form  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellmaster Dedication](compendium/feats/spellmaster-dedication-locg.md)

You can use your magic to transform into a small creature of a type that commonly serves as a spellcaster's familiar, potentially allowing you to safely scout for your party while retaining a degree of spellcasting ability. You gain the [familiar form](compendium/spells/familiar-form-lopsg.md) focus spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
