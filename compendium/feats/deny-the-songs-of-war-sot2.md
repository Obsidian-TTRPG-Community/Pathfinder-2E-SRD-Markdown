# Deny The Songs Of War  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Nantambu Chime-Ringer Dedication](compendium/feats/nantambu-chime-ringer-dedication-sot2.md)

To keep the peace, you disrupt those who seek to break it.

You can cast [deafness](compendium/spells/deafness.md) and 4th-level [silence](compendium/spells/silence.md) once per day each as innate spells. The tradition of these spells is the one you chose for the Nantambu Chime-Ringer Dedication feat.
