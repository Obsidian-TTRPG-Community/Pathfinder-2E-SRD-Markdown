- **Activity** Two-Action

Disks of rock fly to points that you designate to make a new path. You can set them horizontally to make a path across the ground or atop a liquid, or anchor them into a vertical surface to make steps. The path can be up to 20 feet (4 squares) long, and steps can extend up to 10 feet up the side of the surface. All squares must be contiguous and within 60 feet of you. Moving across the path lets a creature ignore difficult terrain and hazardous terrain from the ground beneath it. The disks last until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain the impulse.
