# Analyze Idiolect  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Linguist Dedication](compendium/feats/linguist-dedication-apg.md), expert in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) and [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society)

You break down a specific individual's idiolect, memorizing their speech mannerisms and habits. If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, when you later attempt to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) that individual, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks and DCs. Due to the intense character study required, you can't remember more than one idiolect at a time.
