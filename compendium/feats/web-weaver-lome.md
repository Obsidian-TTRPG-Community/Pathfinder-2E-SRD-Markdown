# Web Weaver  *Feat 1*  
[anadi](rules/traits/anadi-lome.md "Anadi Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You can produce a soft silk to weave into useful items. You gain the [Specialty Crafting](compendium/feats/specialty-crafting.md) feat with a specialty in weaving. You can use your webbing to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) simple, nonconsumable threaded items, such as clothing and rope, at zero cost as long as their base Price is 1 sp or less. These items have no resale value, and they naturally degrade after 24 hours without regular (if minor) maintenance. You can maintain up to 10 such items at a time; if you create a new one, your oldest creation breaks down from neglect. These temporary items take you only 1 day to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) instead of 4. If you're an expert in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting), you can [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) these items in 1 hour; if you're a master, you can [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) them in 10 minutes; if you're legendary, you can [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) them in 1 minute.
