# Predatory Claws  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vampire Dedication](compendium/feats/vampire-dedication-botd.md)

Your nails grow into sharp claws, perfect for seizing and tearing your prey. You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals `1d4` slashing damage. Your claws are in the brawling group and have the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md), [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md), and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.

If you hit the same enemy with two consecutive claw [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) in the same round, you can attempt to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) that same target as a free action, provided you take that action immediately after the second [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
