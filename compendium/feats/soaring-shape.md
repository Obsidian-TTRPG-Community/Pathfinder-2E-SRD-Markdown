# Soaring Shape  *Feat 8*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Wild Shape](compendium/feats/wild-shape.md)

Wings free you from the shackles of the ground below. Add the bat and bird forms in [aerial form](compendium/spells/aerial-form.md) to your wild shape list. If you have [Insect Shape](compendium/feats/insect-shape.md), you also add the wasp form to your wild shape list. If you have [Ferocious Shape](compendium/feats/ferocious-shape.md), you also add the pterosaur form to your wild shape list. Whenever you use wild shape to gain a form that grants you a specific [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) modifier, you gain a +1 status bonus to [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) checks.

## Soaring Shape leads to...

[Dragon Shape](compendium/feats/dragon-shape.md), [True Shapeshifter](compendium/feats/true-shapeshifter.md), [Reactive Transformation](compendium/feats/reactive-transformation-apg.md)
