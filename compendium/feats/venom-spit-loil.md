# Venom Spit  *Feat 5*  
[nagaji](rules/traits/nagaji-loil.md "Nagaji Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You've learned the art of lobbing toxic spittle at vulnerable spots on your foes, especially the eyes. You gain a venomous spit ranged unarmed attack with a range increment of 10 feet that deals `1d4` poison damage. On a critical hit, the target takes [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to the number of weapon damage dice. Your spit doesn't have a weapon group, nor a critical specialization effect.

**Special.** If you have the hooded nagaji heritage, in addition to your venomous spit's normal critical hit effect, the target is also [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until the start of your next turn.
