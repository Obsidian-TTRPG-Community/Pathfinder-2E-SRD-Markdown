# Mountain's Stoutness  *Feat 9*  
[dwarf](rules/traits/dwarf.md "Dwarf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your hardiness lets you withstand more punishment than most before going down. Increase your maximum Hit Points by your level. When you have the [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition, the DC of your recovery checks is equal to 9 + your dying value (instead of 10 + your dying value).

If you also have the [Toughness](compendium/feats/toughness.md) feat, the Hit Points gained from it and this feat are cumulative, and the DC of your recovery checks is equal to 6 + your dying value.
