# Reliable Squire  *Feat 2*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md)  [champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.

You know the path to victory isn't traveled alone, and you lend aid to your companions whenever you can. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to [Aid](rules/actions/aid.md). If you roll a critical failure on a check to [Aid](rules/actions/aid.md), you get a failure instead.
