[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [press](rules/traits/press.md)  [ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hunter's Aim](compendium/feats/hunters-aim.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You carefully track your prey's position and defenses, allowing you to follow up around obstacles that block your shot. Make a ranged weapon [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against your hunted prey. You ignore the target's [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition and all cover.
