# Determined Lore Seeker  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lore Seeker](compendium/feats/lore-seeker-locg.md)

You've mastered useful spells that let you find [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) truths others might miss, and a preferred spell comes naturally to you. When you gain this feat, choose one of the innate spells granted by the [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) Seeker feat: comprehend language, restore senses, or see invisibility. You can cast this spell three times per day instead of once per day.

When you cast any of the spells granted by [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) Seeker as innate spells, they gain additional effects. When you cast [comprehend language](compendium/spells/comprehend-language.md), the spell is heightened to 4th level. When you cast [restore senses](compendium/spells/restore-senses.md),the spell is heightened to half your level, rounded up. When you cast [see invisibility](compendium/spells/see-invisibility.md), for the duration of the spell you can use an action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait, to see [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creatures normally (instead of seeing them as translucent shapes that are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to you) until the end of your next turn.
