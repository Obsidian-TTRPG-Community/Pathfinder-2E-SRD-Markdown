# I Meant To Do That  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication](compendium/feats/unexpected-sharpshooter-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Requirements**: Your previous action was a ranged weapon [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that missed a foe within 60 feet.
- **Activity** Single Action

Somehow your stray bullet causes an unintended reaction that creates a problem for your enemy: perhaps a ricochet knocks your foe's weapon away or they stumble over stray debris in an attempt to dodge your bullets. Roll a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check to attempt to [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md), [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md), or [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) the foe you missed.
