# Leech-clipper  *Feat 1*  
[hobgoblin](rules/traits/hobgoblin-locg.md)  


You are trained to capture deserters, or "leeches." If you critically hit a foe with a weapon from the flail weapon group, you can wrap the weapon around the target's legs and then drop it, causing the foe to take a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds until they or their allies disentangle the weapon, which takes a total of 2 [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions.
