[air](rules/traits/air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait")  [changeling](rules/traits/changeling-b1.md "Changeling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Virga May](compendium/feats/virga-may-loag.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You wrap a shell of favorable wind around a weapon you wield. On your next [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a ranged weapon before the start of your next turn, you don't take circumstance penalties on the attack roll due to wind. In addition, if that weapon has a range increment of 10 feet or less, increase its range increment by 10 feet for that [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
