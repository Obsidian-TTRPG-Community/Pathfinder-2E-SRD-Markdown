- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics), unarmed attacks, and unarmored defense

Your training in the wrestling arts has made you particularly adept at moving, striking, and grappling while unencumbered.

You become an expert in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) and gain the [Titan Wrestler](compendium/feats/titan-wrestler.md) skill feat. You don't take the â€“2 circumstance penalty for making a lethal attack with your nonlethal unarmed attacks. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude DC when resisting an opponent's attempts to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) you or Swallow you Whole.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the wrestler archetype.
