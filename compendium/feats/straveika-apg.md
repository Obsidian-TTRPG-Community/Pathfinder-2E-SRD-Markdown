# Straveika  *Feat 1*  
[dhampir](rules/traits/dhampir-b1.md "Dhampir Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  


You descend from one of the truly ancient vampires, a nosferatu cursed to eternal life but not eternal youth. People call you straveika, or ancient-born. The vestiges of your forebear's powers of domination have left you with an understanding of how a creature's intentions change its behaviors. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to [Sense Motive](rules/actions/sense-motive.md) and [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DCs against attempts to [Lie](rules/actions/lie.md) to you.

## Straveika leads to...
