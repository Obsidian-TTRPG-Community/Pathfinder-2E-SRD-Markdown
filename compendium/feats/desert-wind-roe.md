- **Activity** Single Action

A vortex of sand and dust surrounds you. Each creature inside your kinetic aura (including you) is [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) from any creature outside your kinetic aura, and creatures outside the aura are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) from creatures inside the aura other than you.

Your air impulses carry sands that cut at great speed. When you use a damaging air impulse that affects at least one creature in your kinetic aura, that impulse deals 1 additional slashing damage, or 2 if the impulse has a single target.
