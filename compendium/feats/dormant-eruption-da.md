# Dormant Eruption  *Feat 14*  
[aftermath](rules/traits/aftermath-da.md)  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md)  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: You've been brought to 0 Hit Points by an enemy that has the [fire](rules/traits/fire.md) trait or an enemy's ability that has the [fire](rules/traits/fire.md) trait.

A sweltering heat and sparks of flame that take the form of tiny copies of you surround your body. You're hot to the touch, gaining resistance 5 to cold and fire. Whenever an adjacent creature [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) you with a melee attack or touches you, it takes `1d6` [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). You gain the Thermal Eruption action.

title: Thermal Eruption[two-actions]
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md)  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md)  

You concentrate your thermal energy and explode it outward. All creatures in a 20-foot emanation take `14d6` fire damage with a basic Reflex save. Afterward, you lose all effects of the Dormant Eruption feat until your next daily preparations.
