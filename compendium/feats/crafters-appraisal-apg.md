# Crafter's Appraisal  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

Your knowledge of items' construction allows you to discern their [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") effects as well. You can use [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) instead of a skill associated with a magic tradition to [Identify Magic](rules/actions/identify-magic.md) on magic items, though not on any other sorts of magic.
