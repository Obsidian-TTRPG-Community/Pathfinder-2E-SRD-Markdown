[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [ifrit](rules/traits/ifrit-b2.md "Ifrit Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** Your turn begins.
- **Activity** Reaction

You explode in flame. Enemies in a 20-foot emanation take `7d6` fire damage (basic Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). Allies in the area are [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) for 1 round and can use the additional action to [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md).
