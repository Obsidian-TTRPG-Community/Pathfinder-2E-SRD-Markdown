# Winter's Embrace  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  


Your eyes are accustomed to the harsh glare of the sun on snow and ice. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against effects that inflict the [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) condition.

Snow doesn't impair your vision; you ignore concealment from snowfall. Your skin becomes cold to the touch, and sometimes frost forms on you. You are protected from severe cold and heat.
