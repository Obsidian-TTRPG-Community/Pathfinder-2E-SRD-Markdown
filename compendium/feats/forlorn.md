# Forlorn  *Feat 1*  
[elf](rules/traits/elf.md)  


Watching your friends age and die fills you with moroseness that protects you against harmful emotions. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md) effects. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md) effect, you get a critical success instead.
