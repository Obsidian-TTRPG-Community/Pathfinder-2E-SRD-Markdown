# Instrument Of Zeal  *Feat 16*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: divine ally (blade), tenets of good

Divine energy fills your weapon. Whenever you critically hit a foe with [Blade of Justice](compendium/feats/blade-of-justice.md) or a [Retributive Strike](rules/actions/retributive-strike.md), your attack adds an extra damage die, and the target is [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) on its next turn.
