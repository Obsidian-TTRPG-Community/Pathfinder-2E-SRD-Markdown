[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Oozemorph Dedication](compendium/feats/oozemorph-dedication-sli.md)

Your limbs produce strange, sucker-like growths that allow you to adhere to walls, objects, and most other surfaces. You gain a climb Speed equal to your half your land Speed (minimum 5 feet). If you have the [Quick Climb](compendium/feats/quick-climb.md) feat, your climb Speed is equal to your land Speed.

In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC to avoid being [Disarmed](rules/actions/disarm.md).
