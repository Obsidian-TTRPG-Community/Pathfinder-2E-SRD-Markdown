# Surreptitious Spellcaster  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellmaster Dedication](compendium/feats/spellmaster-dedication-locg.md)

You've learned that it pays for a Pathfinder to be able to cast spells without being noticed. You gain the [Conceal Spell](compendium/feats/conceal-spell.md) wizard class feat, though it's not a wizard feat for you. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks to Conceal a Spell and to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks to conceal verbal components.
