# Blessed Spell  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Blessed One Dedication](compendium/feats/blessed-one-dedication-apg.md), ability to cast spells from spell slots, [Mercy](compendium/feats/mercy.md)
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Activity** Single Action

When you focus your magic on an ally, you can remove harmful conditions. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from a spell slot, and that spell targets only a single ally, you can also attempt to remove a harmful condition from that ally. The condition must be one that could be removed by your [Mercy](compendium/feats/mercy.md) feat, including those granted by later feats such as [Greater Mercy](compendium/feats/greater-mercy.md). Attempt a counteract check based on the spell's DC and level. This effect is in addition to the normal effects of your spell.
