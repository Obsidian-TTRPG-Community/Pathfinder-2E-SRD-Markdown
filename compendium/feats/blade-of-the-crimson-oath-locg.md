# Blade Of The Crimson Oath  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Reclaimant Dedication](compendium/feats/knight-reclaimant-dedication-locg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You call upon the Crimson Oath to smite undead and then make a weapon or unarmed [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against an undead foe. The [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) deals two extra weapon damage dice, and you can convert all the physical damage from the attack into positive damage.
