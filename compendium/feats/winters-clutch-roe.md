- **Activity** Two-Action

Gleaming flakes of chilling snow fall in a 10-foot burst within 60 feet. Each creature in the area takes `2d4` cold damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The ground in the area is covered in a snow drift, which is difficult terrain.

Each square of the drift lasts until it melts, either naturally or until fire damage is dealt in that square.
