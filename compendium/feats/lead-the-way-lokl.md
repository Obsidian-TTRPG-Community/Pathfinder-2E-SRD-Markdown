# Lead the Way  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Vigilant Dedication](compendium/feats/knight-vigilant-dedication-locg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You move forward, creating an opening for others to follow. Choose one adjacent ally who has a reaction available. You [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), and that ally can use their reaction to immediately [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md). The ally must end their [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) adjacent to you. If the ally Strides in this way, they don't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by movement. You, however, still trigger those reactions normally.
