# Shared Warding  *Feat 12*  
[thaumaturge](rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Esoteric Warden

You ward your allies from the attacks of your foes whenever you apply those protections to yourself. When you gain a status bonus to AC and saves from Esoteric Warden, you can choose to grant the same benefit to all allies within 30 feet.
