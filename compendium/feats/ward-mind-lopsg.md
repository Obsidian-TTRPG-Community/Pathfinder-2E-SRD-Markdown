# Ward Mind  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 16*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Scrollmaster Dedication](compendium/feats/scrollmaster-dedication-locg.md)
- **Trigger** Your turn ends.
- **Requirements**: You're currently affected by a [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect that you gained by failing, but not critically failing, a saving throw.
- **Activity** Reaction

To protect the knowledge within your mind from intrusion or erasure, you ward yourself against a mental attack, temporarily delaying its effects. Until the end of your next turn, you ignore a single [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect that meets the requirement.

You can suppress a particular effect using Ward Mind or Cognitive Loophole (Core Rulebook 188) only once, even if you have both feats.

**Special.** You can use this reaction even if the [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect prevents you from using reactions.
