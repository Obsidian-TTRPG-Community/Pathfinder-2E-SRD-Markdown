# Callow May  *Feat 1*  
[changeling](rules/traits/changeling-b1.md "Changeling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  


You are among the most common of changelings—those born to green hags—and a vibrant green eye signifies that parentage.

Your mother's manipulative nature and versatile voice gives you an edge when deceiving others. You gain the [Charming Liar](compendium/feats/charming-liar.md) skill feat. If you roll [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) for initiative, foes in that combat encounter that haven't acted yet are [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against you.
