# Unconventional Weaponry  *Feat 1*  
[human](rules/traits/human.md)  


You've familiarized yourself with a particular weapon, potentially from another ancestry or culture. Choose an uncommon simple or martial weapon with a trait corresponding to an ancestry (such as [dwarf](rules/traits/dwarf.md), [goblin](rules/traits/goblin.md), or [orc](rules/traits/orc.md)) or that is common in another culture. You gain access to that weapon, and for the purpose of determining your proficiency, that weapon is a simple weapon.

If you are trained in all martial weapons, you can choose an uncommon advanced weapon with such a trait. You gain access to that weapon, and for the purpose of determining your proficiency, that weapon is a martial weapon.
