# Know Oneself  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md)  [human](rules/traits/human.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Vudrani ethnicity
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You roll a critical failure on a saving throw against an [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md) effect.
- **Activity** Reaction

You center yourself and call to mind the Vudrani monastic ideals of mindfulness and self-knowledge. You fail the save against the [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md) effect instead of critically failing.
