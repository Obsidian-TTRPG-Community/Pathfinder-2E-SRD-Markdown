# Sticky Poison  *Feat 6*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md)  


A combination of additional viscosity and careful application keeps your weapons poisoned even when suffering significant wear and tear. If your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a poisoned weapon would expend its poison without your target attempting an initial save (due to resistance or your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) being a critical failure, for example), attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned. If your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a poisoned weapon succeeds, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned until the end of your next turn.
