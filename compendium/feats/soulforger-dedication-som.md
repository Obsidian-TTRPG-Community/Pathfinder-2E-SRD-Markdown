# Soulforger Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Wis 14 or ability to cast divine spells

You can manifest the power of your spirit in combat to realize your motivations. You manifest an armor, shield, or weapon as a soulforged armament (page 232). Choose one essence power for the armament (below). Changing an essence power requires 1 week of retraining, and you can't retrain it while you have soulforged corruption.

You can Manifest Soulforged Armament to summon your armaments in combat.

- **Requirements**: If summoning a weapon or shield, you have the hands free to wield it; if summoning armor, you aren't wearing any armor

**Effect** You immediately wield or wear the soulforged armament bound to you. The soulforged armament remains manifested until you [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) this effect.

Once per day when you use this ability, you can manifest the armament's essence form. You gain the armament's essence power until it's Dismissed.

After 1 minute, the essence form armament is automatically Dismissed.
