# Red Mantis Assassin Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: You are from Mediogalti Island.
- **Prerequisites**: trained in sawtooth sabers, deity is [Achaekek](compendium/setting/deities/achaekek-logm.md), lawful evil alignment, member of the Red Mantis assassins

You have learned how to stalk your foes and slay them with a sawtooth sabre. You become trained in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) and [Assassin Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. Whenever your proficiency in any weapon increases to expert or beyond, you also gain that new proficiency with sawtooth sabers.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Red Mantis assassin archetype.
