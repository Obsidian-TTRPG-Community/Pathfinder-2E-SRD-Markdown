# Wind-tossed Spell  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[air](rules/traits/air.md)  [archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Elementalist Dedication](compendium/feats/elementalist-dedication-som.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You enhance your spell with elemental air, using the wind to find your target and carry your magic around cover.

If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that requires a spell attack roll, you ignore the target's [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition and any cover they have from you. The spell gains the [air](rules/traits/air.md) trait.
