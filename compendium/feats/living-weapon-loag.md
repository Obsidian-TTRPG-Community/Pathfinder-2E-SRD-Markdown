You've learned to use part of your form as a weapon. When you select this feat, you gain a claws unarmed attack that deals `1d4` slashing damage and has the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait") and [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait") traits; a horn, jaws, or tusk unarmed attack that deals `1d6` piercing damage and has the versatile S trait; or a tail unarmed attack that deals `1d6` bludgeoning damage and has the [backswing](rules/traits/backswing.md "Backswing Weapon Trait") trait. Each of these unarmed attacks is in the brawling weapon group.
