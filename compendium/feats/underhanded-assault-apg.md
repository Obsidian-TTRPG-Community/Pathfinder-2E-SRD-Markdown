# Underhanded Assault  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 2*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You capitalize on the distraction provided by an ally. You [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md) up to a foe adjacent to one of your allies. You can roll against the foe you're [Sneaking](rules/actions/sneak.md) up on, even if it's currently [observing](rules/conditions.md#Observed) you, as though you were [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden). You take a â€“2 penalty on your [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check. If your [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check against the chosen foe succeeds, you can make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against that foe at the end of your [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md).
