# Cloud Walk  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dragon Disciple Dedication](compendium/feats/dragon-disciple-dedication-apg.md)

Your growing link to cloud dragons has granted you the ability to walk on clouds. Once per hour, you can cast [air walk](compendium/spells/air-walk.md) on yourself as an innate arcane spell, but only to walk on clouds or fog.
