# Reptile Rider  *Feat 1*  
[lizardfolk](rules/traits/lizardfolk-b1.md "Lizardfolk Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


To you, crocodilians, giant lizards, and dinosaurs are loyal steeds, not monsters.

You gain the [Ride](compendium/feats/ride.md) feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature) checks to Handle an Animal as long as the animal is a reptile, dinosaur, or even a non-sapient dragon.
