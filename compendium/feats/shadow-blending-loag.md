[fetchling](rules/traits/fetchling-b2.md "Fetchling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")  [shadow](rules/traits/shadow.md "Shadow General Trait")  

- **Trigger** A creature attempts a flat check to target you while you're [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) or [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) due to dim light or darkness.
- **Activity** Reaction

You draw shadows close to create a shroud. Increase the DC of the flat check by 2.
