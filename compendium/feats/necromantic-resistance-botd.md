[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Undead Slayer Dedication](compendium/feats/undead-slayer-dedication-botd.md)

As part of your training, you've inured yourself against necromancy through grueling, repeated exposure. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md) effects and gain resistance to negative damage equal to half your level.
