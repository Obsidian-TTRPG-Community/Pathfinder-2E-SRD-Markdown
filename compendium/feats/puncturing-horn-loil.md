# Puncturing Horn  *Feat 1*  
[kashrishi](rules/traits/kashrishi-loil.md "Kashrishi Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


While many kashrishi never use their horns for more than cracking open hard-shelled fruits or amplifying their psychic powers, you've practiced using yours offensively. You gain a horn unarmed attack that deals `1d6` piercing damage. Your horn is in the brawling group and has the [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait") and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits.

**Special.** If you have the xyloshi heritage, your horn instead deals `1d8` piercing damage.
