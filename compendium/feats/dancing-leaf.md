# Dancing Leaf  *Feat 2*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  


You are as light as a leaf whirling in the breeze. When you [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) or succeed at a [High Jump](rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](rules/actions/long-jump.md), increase the distance you jump by 5 feet. When calculating the damage you take from falling, don't count any distance fallen while you are adjacent to a wall.
