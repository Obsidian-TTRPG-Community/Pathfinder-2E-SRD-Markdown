- **Prerequisites**: Alkenstar Agent Dedication, master in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society)

You're practiced at creating forgeries that establish your outlaw credentials or augment your legal authority. You can [Create a Forgery](rules/actions/create-forgery.md) as an exploration activity. It takes you about 1 hour per page of the document that you're forging. This time is reduced to 10 minutes per page if you're legendary in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society).
