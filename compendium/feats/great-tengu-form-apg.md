# Great Tengu Form  *Feat 17*  
[tengu](rules/traits/tengu-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Long-Nosed Form](compendium/feats/long-nosed-form-apg.md)

You take on the imposing form of a large, winged oni. Once per day, as part of using [Long-Nosed Form](compendium/feats/long-nosed-form-apg.md), you also gain the benefits of 4th-level [enlarge](compendium/spells/enlarge.md) and fly. This lasts for 5 minutes or until you shift out of your [Long-Nosed Form](compendium/feats/long-nosed-form-apg.md), whichever happens first.
