# Quiet Allies  *Feat 2*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth)

You're skilled at moving with a group. When you are [Avoiding Notice](rules/actions/avoid-notice.md) and your allies [Follow the Expert](rules/actions/follow-the-expert.md), you and those allies can roll a single [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check, using the lowest modifier, instead of rolling separately. This doesn't apply for initiative rolls.
