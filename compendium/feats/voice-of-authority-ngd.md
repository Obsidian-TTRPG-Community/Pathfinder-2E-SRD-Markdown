[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [vigilante](rules/traits/vigilante-apg.md "Vigilante Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), [Vigilante Dedication](compendium/feats/vigilante-dedication-apg.md), member of the Gray Gardeners

You easily command the attention of others, and when the time comes to turn threats into action, your authoritative voice causes foes to falter.

Your voice be heard easily by any creatures within 300 feet if you wish, regardless of the level of ambient noise, although your voice can't penetrate silence or similar effect. If you roll [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) for initiative, on the first round of combat, creatures that haven't acted yet are [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to you.

## Voice of Authority leads to...

[Strident Command](compendium/feats/strident-command-ngd.md)
