# Razzle-dazzle  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 1*  
[gnome](rules/traits/gnome.md "Gnome Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger** You blind or dazzle a creature.
- **Activity** Free Action

You've spent considerable time practicing the manipulation of light, weaponizing your blade's reflection or bolstering the luminosity of magical displays to unconventional heights. Extend the duration of the [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) or [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) condition you give the target by 1 round.
