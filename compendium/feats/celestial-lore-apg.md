# Celestial Lore  *Feat 1*  
[aasimar](rules/traits/aasimar-apg.md)  


You were raised with an aasimar or celestial relative, or you've devoted yourself to researching the secrets of the celestial realms. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) and [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in a [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill related to the celestial realm from which you trace your lineage (usually [Elysium Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), [Heaven Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), or [Nirvana Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore)).
