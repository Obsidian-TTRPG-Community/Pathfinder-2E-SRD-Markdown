# Know It All  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Eldritch Researcher Dedication](compendium/feats/eldritch-researcher-dedication-av2.md)

Your knowledge of abstruse topics is unparalleled. When you succeed at a check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), you gain additional information or context. When you critically succeed at a Knowledge check, at the GM's discretion you might gain even more additional information or context than normal.
