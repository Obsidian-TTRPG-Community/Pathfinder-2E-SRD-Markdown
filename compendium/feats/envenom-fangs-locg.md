# Envenom Fangs  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 5*  
[lizardfolk](rules/traits/lizardfolk-b1.md "Lizardfolk Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sharp Fangs](compendium/feats/sharp-fangs-locg.md)
- **Frequency**: a number of times per day equal to your level
- **Activity** Single Action

You envenom your fangs. If the next fangs [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) you make before the end of your next turn hits and deals damage, the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) deals an additional `1d6` poison damage.

On a critical failure, the poison is wasted as normal.
