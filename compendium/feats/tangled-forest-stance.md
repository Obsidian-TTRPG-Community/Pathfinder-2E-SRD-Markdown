# Tangled Forest Stance  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You extend your arms like gnarled branches to interfere with your foes' movements. You can make lashing branch unarmed attacks. These deal `1d8` slashing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md), [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md), [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md), and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.

While you're in Tangled Forest Stance and can act, every enemy in your reach that tries to move away from you must succeed at a Reflex save, [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check, or [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check against your class DC or be [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) for that action. If you prefer, you can allow the enemy to move.
