# Dragon Roar  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md)  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md)  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md)  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md)  [monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dragon Stance](compendium/feats/dragon-stance.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in Dragon Stance.
- **Activity** Single Action

You bellow, instilling fear in your enemies. Enemies within a 15-foot emanation must succeed at a Will save against your [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) DC or be [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) ([frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical failure). When a creature [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) by the roar begins its turn adjacent to you, it can't reduce its [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) value below 1 on that turn. Your first attack that hits a [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) creature after you roar and before the end of your next turn gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage.

After you use Dragon Roar, you can't use it again for `1d4` rounds. Its effects end immediately if you leave Dragon Stance. Creatures in the area of your roar are then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
