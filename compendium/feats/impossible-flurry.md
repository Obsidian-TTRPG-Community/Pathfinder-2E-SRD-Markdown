[flourish](rules/traits/flourish.md "Flourish Combat Trait")  [open](rules/traits/open.md "Open Combat Trait")  [ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md "Ranger Class Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.
- **Activity** Three-Action

You forgo precision to attack at an impossible speed. Make three melee [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) with each of the required weapons. All of these [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) take the maximum multiple attack penalty, as if you had already made two or more attacks this turn.

## Impossible Flurry leads to...
