[bard](rules/traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Activity** Three-Action

You remember the revelry of the Night Parade and call them to your aid in a riotous display. You [Perform](rules/actions/perform.md) and cast 8th-level [mad monkeys](compendium/spells/mad-monkeys-apg.md) (Advanced Player's Guide 222) three times, except that the spell calls various apparitions such as dancing tsukumogami or drinking oni rather than monkeys. Each casting can produce a different kind of mischief. You can Sustain all three Spells each round using a single [Perform](rules/actions/perform.md) action.
