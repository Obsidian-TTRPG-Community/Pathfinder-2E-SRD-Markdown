# Lie To Me  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception)

You can use [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) to weave traps to trip up anyone trying to deceive you. If you can engage in conversation with someone trying to [Lie](rules/actions/lie.md) to you, use your [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) DC if it is higher than your [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC to determine whether they succeed. This doesn't apply if you don't have a back-and-forth dialogue, such as when someone attempts to [Lie](rules/actions/lie.md) during a long speech.
