# Waxed Feathers  *Feat 1*  
[tengu](rules/traits/tengu-b1.md "Tengu Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: wavediver tengu heritage

Your feathers are coated in a waxy substance that repels water. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that have the [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") trait. So long as you're in a dry place, you can spend one action to shake off any water that clings to your clothing and feathers to instantly become dry.
