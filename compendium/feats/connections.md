# Connections  *Feat 2*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society), [Courtly Graces](compendium/feats/courtly-graces.md)

You have social connections you can leverage to trade favors or meet important people. When you're in an area with connections (typically a settlement where you've spent downtime building connections, or possibly another area in the same nation), you can attempt a [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) check to arrange a meeting with an important political figure or ask for a favor in exchange for a later favor of your contact's choice. The GM decides the DC based on the difficulty of the favor and the figure's prominence.

## Connections leads to...

[Quick Contacts](compendium/feats/quick-contacts-apg.md)
