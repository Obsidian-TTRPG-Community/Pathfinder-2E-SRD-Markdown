# Invoke The Elements  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 9*  
[changeling](rules/traits/changeling-b1.md "Changeling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Brine May](compendium/feats/brine-may-apg.md), [Snow May](compendium/feats/snow-may-loag.md), [Veil May](compendium/feats/veil-may-loag.md), or [Virga May](compendium/feats/virga-may-loag.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You summon an aura of shimmering heat, flurrying snow, crashing waves, or swirling wind and lightning. For 1 minute, you gain concealment against creatures more than 5 feet away, and any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you suffers `1d12` damage (basic Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). At 13th and 17th level, this damage increases by `1d12`. A veil may changeling deals fire damage, a snow may changeling deals cold damage, a brine may changeling deals bludgeoning damage and the effect gains the [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") trait, and a virga may changeling deals electricity damage.
