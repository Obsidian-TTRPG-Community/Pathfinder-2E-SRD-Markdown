# Silencing Strike  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md)  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

A quick strike to the face or mouth silences your opponent. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe. The foe must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The target is dazed and can barely vocalize. It's [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) and its speech is raspy and hard to understand. It must succeed at a DC 11 flat check to use linguistic actions or supply verbal spellcasting components until the end of its next turn.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) instead of [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
