# Forgotten Presence  *Feat 8*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  


The world conspires to keep you forgotten and [unnoticed](rules/conditions.md#Unnoticed)— memories cloud, ink stains out your name in ledgers, and portraits of you crack and warp over your face. Characters attempting to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about you take a –2 circumstance penalty.

Add [modify memory](compendium/spells/modify-memory.md) to your spell list as a primal spell.
