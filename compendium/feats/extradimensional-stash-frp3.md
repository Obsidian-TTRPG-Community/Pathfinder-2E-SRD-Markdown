# Extradimensional Stash  *Feat 20*  
[extradimensional](rules/traits/extradimensional.md "Extradimensional Effect Trait")  [rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery)

When you perform sleight of hand, you fold space so that objects really do disappear. You create a small extradimensional space somewhere within in your clothing that can hold up to 5 Bulk worth of objects. The space functions as a bag of holding, but can hold only up to 5 Bulk, has no Bulk of its own, and can be Interacted with using only one hand.

In addition, when you [Palm an Object](rules/actions/palm-an-object.md), you can place it directly into this extradimensional space as long as the space has sufficient free space to hold the object.
