# Loremaster Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in at least one skill to [Decipher Writing](rules/actions/decipher-writing.md)

You've compiled a vast repository of information that touches on nearly every subject. You are trained in [Loremaster Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), a special [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill that can be used only to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), but on any topic. If you have legendary proficiency in a skill used to [Decipher Writing](rules/actions/decipher-writing.md), you gain expert proficiency in [Loremaster Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), but you can't increase your proficiency rank in [Loremaster Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) by any other means. You can take feats in the loremaster's additional feats entry even if you don't meet the enigma muse prerequisite.

If you have the [Bardic Lore](compendium/feats/bardic-lore.md) class feat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with [Bardic Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the loremaster archetype.

## Loremaster Dedication leads to...

[Magical Edification](compendium/feats/magical-edification-apg.md), [Greater Magical Edification](compendium/feats/greater-magical-edification-apg.md), [Orthographic Mastery](compendium/feats/orthographic-mastery-apg.md), [Quick Study](compendium/feats/quick-study-apg.md)
