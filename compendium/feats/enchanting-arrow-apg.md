- **Prerequisites**: [Eldritch Archer Dedication](compendium/feats/eldritch-archer-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

With a single whisper carried on the wind, you enchant your ammunition to make a foe more vulnerable to your attacks.

Make a bow [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). On a hit, the target takes an additional `2d6` mental damage. On a critical hit, the target also becomes [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned). The mental damage increases to `3d6` if your bow has a greater striking rune, or to `4d6` if your bow has a major striking rune.
