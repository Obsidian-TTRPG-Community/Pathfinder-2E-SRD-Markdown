# Fiendish Mount  *Feat 20*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: divine ally (steed), tenets of evil

Your steed ally manifests a suite of powerful and sinister gifts granted to it by your deity. It gains [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md), its maximum Hit Points increase by 40, and it gains weakness 10 to good damage.

Additionally, it grows wings appropriate for a servitor of your deity (such as bat wings for a devil), granting it a fly Speed equal to its Speed. It gains the [fiend](rules/traits/fiend.md) trait and the trait appropriate to the type of servitor it has become (such as daemon, demon, or devil).
