# Inescapable Grasp  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Wrestler Dedication](compendium/feats/wrestler-dedication-lotgb.md)

Your grasp has a supernatural quality to it, preventing your foes from easily escapingâ€”with or without magical assistance.

If a creature you have [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) attempts to use a teleportation spell or effect, it must succeed at a DC 15 flat check or the spell fails. If a creature you have [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) attempts to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) while under the effect of freedom of movement, it must succeed at a DC 15 flat check or be forced to roll the [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) attempt normally, rather than automatically succeeding.
