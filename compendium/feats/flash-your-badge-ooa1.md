# Flash Your Badge  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Alkenstar Agent Dedication, master in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You make a fearsome show of your authority. Roll [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks to [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) each creature in a 30-foot cone. When you do so, [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) gains the [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") trait, and creatures are affected if they can see you. If a target creature hasn't broken a law in the past week (as determined by the GM), the result of your check against that creature is one degree of success worse than the result you rolled.
