# Stargazer's Eyes  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Oatia Skysage Dedication](compendium/feats/oatia-skysage-dedication-gw1.md)

Long hours in darkened observatories have sharpened your senses. If you don't have low-light vision or darkvision, you gain low-light vision, or if you already have low-light vision, you gain darkvision.

**Special.** You can take this feat a second time, upgrading your low-light vision to darkvision.
