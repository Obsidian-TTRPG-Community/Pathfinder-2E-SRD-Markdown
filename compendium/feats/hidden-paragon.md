# Hidden Paragon  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 20*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger** You successfully use [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) and become [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from all of your current foes, or use [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) to [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md) and become [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) to all your current foes.
- **Activity** Reaction

When you put your mind to slipping out of sight, you disappear completely. You become [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) for 1 minute, even if you use a hostile action. Not even [glitterdust](compendium/spells/glitterdust.md), [see invisibility](compendium/spells/see-invisibility.md), or similar effects can reveal you, though creatures can still use the [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) action to locate you as normal.
