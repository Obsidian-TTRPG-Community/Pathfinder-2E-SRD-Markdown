# Reminder of the Greater Fear  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [vigilante](rules/traits/vigilante-apg.md "Vigilante Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), [Vigilante Dedication](compendium/feats/vigilante-dedication-apg.md)
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Trigger** Another creature within 30 feet of you that can see you would gain the [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition.
- **Activity** Reaction

You give a target a stern glower to remind them that it is you, and no one else, they should truly fear. Reduce the value of the [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition the creature would take by 1.
