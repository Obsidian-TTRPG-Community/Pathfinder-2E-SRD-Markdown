# Devastating Weaponry  [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 18*  
[inventor](rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md "Inventor Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: weapon innovation
- **Activity** Three-Action

You release a volley of projectiles from your weapon, or power it to fly in every direction across the battlefield and [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) multiple creatures. Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with your weapon innovation against each foe within 30 feet of you. Don't increase your multiple attack penalty until after making all the attacks. If your innovation is a melee weapon and any of the attacks are outside your reach, you [Release](rules/actions/release.md) the weapon before the [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), and it returns to your grasp after all of them. If your hands are full when the weapon returns, it falls to the ground in your space. As normal, if your weapon innovation requires one or more actions to reload between [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), you can't use it to make multiple attacks with Devastating Weaponry.
