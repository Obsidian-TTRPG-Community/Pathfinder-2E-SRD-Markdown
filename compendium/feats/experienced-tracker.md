# Experienced Tracker  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival)

Tracking is second nature to you, and when necessary you can follow a trail without pause. You can [Track](rules/actions/track.md) while moving at full Speed by taking a –5 penalty to your [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) check. If you're a master in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival), you don't take the –5 penalty. If you're legendary in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival), you no longer need to roll a new [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) check every hour when tracking, though you still need to roll whenever there are significant changes in the trail.
