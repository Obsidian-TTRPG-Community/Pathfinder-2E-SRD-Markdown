# Aura Of Vengeance  *Feat 14*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: exalt, [Vengeful Oath](compendium/feats/vengeful-oath.md)

When you call upon others to take retribution, you also guide their aim. When you use [Retributive Strike](rules/actions/retributive-strike.md), your allies who make [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) take only a –2 penalty, instead of a –5 penalty.
