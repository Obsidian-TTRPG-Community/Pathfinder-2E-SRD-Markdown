# Cognitive Loophole  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 16*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Trigger** Your turn ends.
- **Requirements**: You are currently affected by a [mental](rules/traits/mental.md) effect that you gained by failing, but not critically failing, a saving throw.
- **Activity** Reaction

You can find a loophole in a [mental](rules/traits/mental.md) effect to temporarily overcome it. Until the end of your next turn, you ignore a single [mental](rules/traits/mental.md) effect that meets the requirement. You can suppress a particular effect using Cognitive Loophole only once.

**Special.** You can use this reaction even if the [mental](rules/traits/mental.md) effect is preventing you from using reactions.
