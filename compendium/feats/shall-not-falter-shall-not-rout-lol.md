# Shall Not Falter, Shall Not Rout  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Reclaimant Dedication](compendium/feats/knight-reclaimant-dedication-locg.md)

You gain the [shall not falter, shall not rout](compendium/spells/shall-not-falter-shall-not-rout-lol.md) focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) activity to recite the Crimson Oath and meditate on its teachings. If you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your knight reclaimant focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs and your spellcasting ability is Charisma.
