- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy)
- **Activity** Three-Action

You attempt to reduce panic. Attempt a [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check, comparing it to the Will DC of creatures in a 10-foot emanation around you who are [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened). Each of them is temporarily immune for 1 hour.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Reduce the creature's [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) value by 2.
> - **Success** Reduce the creature's [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) value by 1.
