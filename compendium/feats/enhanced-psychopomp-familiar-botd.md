# Enhanced Psychopomp Familiar  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Psychopomp Familiar](compendium/feats/psychopomp-familiar-botd.md)

Your psychopomp's continued service in [Pharasma](compendium/setting/deities/pharasma.md)'s name brings it favor from the goddess. It might change appearance to look like a different, more powerful kind of psychopomp. You can select four familiar or master abilities each day, instead of two, but two must be from the [Psychopomp Familiar](compendium/feats/psychopomp-familiar-botd.md) feat or the following ability.

- **Augury** Your familiar can glimpse the strands of fate to give you a cryptic clue regarding your future. Your familiar can cast [augury](compendium/spells/augury.md) once per day using your magical tradition and spell DC. You must be at least 8th level to select this ability.
