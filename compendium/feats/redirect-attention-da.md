# Redirect Attention  *Feat 13*  
[reflection](rules/traits/reflection-da.md "Reflection Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Through your strong connection with your progenitor, you're able to redirect those attempting to spy on you. Whenever you would be directly targeted with a [scrying](rules/traits/scrying.md "Scrying Effect Trait") effect, the effect must attempt a counteract check against the higher of your spell DC or class DC. If the check fails, the effect targets your progenitor instead of you.
