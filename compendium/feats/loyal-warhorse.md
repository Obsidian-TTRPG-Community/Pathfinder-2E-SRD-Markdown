# Loyal Warhorse  *Feat 6*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: divine ally (steed)

You and your mount have grown closer, and your loyalty to each other is unbreakable. The mount you gained through the [divine ally](compendium/feats/divine-ally.md) class feature is now a specialized animal companion. In addition, your mount never attacks you, even if it is magically compelled to do so.

## Loyal Warhorse leads to...

[Imposing Destrier](compendium/feats/imposing-destrier.md), [Auspicious Mount](compendium/feats/auspicious-mount.md)
