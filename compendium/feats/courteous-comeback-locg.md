# Courteous Comeback  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 1*  
[fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [human](rules/traits/human.md "Human Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: Keleshite nationality
- **Trigger** You critically fail a [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check.
- **Requirements**: You're in a settlement or community, and you haven't used Courteous Comeback in this settlement or community within the past month.

You grew up in the proud Padishah Empire, where even insults have a certain poetic wit. Reroll the triggering [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check, using the second result.
