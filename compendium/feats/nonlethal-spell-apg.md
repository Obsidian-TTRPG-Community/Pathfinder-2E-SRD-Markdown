# Nonlethal Spell  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You can alter offensive spells to be less deadly. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that deals damage and doesn't have the [death](rules/traits/death.md) or [negative](rules/traits/negative.md) trait, that spell gains the [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md) trait.
