# Lab Rat  *Feat 5*  
[ratfolk](rules/traits/ratfolk-b1.md "Ratfolk Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You've spent more than your share of time in an alchemy lab. You might have been an alchemist yourself, an assistant, or perhaps even a test subject. Either way, you have been exposed to a wide variety of alchemical poisons and elixirs, leaving you with increased tolerance of their effects. You have a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against poison and harmful effects from elixirs. If you roll a success on your saving throw against an elixir or poison, you get a critical success instead.
