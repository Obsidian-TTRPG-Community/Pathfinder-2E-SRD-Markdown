# Coordinated Distraction  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: Help either the Washboard Dogs or the Diobel Sweepers destroy their rival.
- **Activity** Single Action

With a sharp whistle or wave of your hands, you distract an opponent from the fact that one of your allies is about to attack them. Choose a target and an ally, both of whom must be within 30 feet. The target is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the first [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) the ally makes on their next turn; if your ally doesn't [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that target, the effect is lost. Depending on how you describe your distraction, this action gains either the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") or [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") trait.
