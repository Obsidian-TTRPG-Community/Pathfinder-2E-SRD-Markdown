# Familiar's Language  *Feat 2*  
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md)  [witch](rules/traits/witch-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: a familiar

You've learned to speak with your familiar and other creatures like it. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) skill with creatures of the same family of animals as your familiar. For example, if your familiar were a cat, you could gain the effects of speak with animals for any felines (including leopards, lions, and tigers, among others)

This ability doesn't make them more [friendly](rules/conditions.md#Friendly) than normal.

If your familiar ever changes to a different creature, you can't use this ability for 1 week while you absorb your new familiar's language.

**Special.** This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).
