# Striker's Scroll  *Feat 4*  
[magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md)

You can attach a scroll to your weapon or handwraps of mighty blows to blend its spell into an attack, carefully folding it around a part of the weapon or sealing it to the weapon's surface. Attaching a scroll requires using the [Affix a Talisman](rules/actions/affix-a-talisman.md) action. You can have only one scroll affixed to a weapon at a time, and you can't have both a talisman and scroll attached.

You can [Cast the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from the scroll as part of a [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md), assuming the spell is one you could normally use with [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md). You can't [Cast the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) in any other way while it's affixed, though you can use [Affix a Talisman](rules/actions/affix-a-talisman.md) again to remove the scroll and use it as a normal—if a bit crumpled—scroll.
