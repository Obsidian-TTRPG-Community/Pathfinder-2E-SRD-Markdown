[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lion Blade Dedication](compendium/feats/lion-blade-dedication-lowg.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You use your movements and disguises to make yourself a flickering blur. You gain concealment until your next turn. As usual for concealment involving an obvious visual manifestation, you can't use this concealment to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md).
