# Beacon Mark  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Tracing Sigil](compendium/feats/tracing-sigil-lotgb.md)

When you cast [sigil](compendium/spells/sigil.md), you can modify the spell to add the following heightened entry.

**Heightened (4th)** You attune yourself to the marked target.

While the spell lasts, you can spend a single action, which has the concentrate, [detection](rules/traits/detection.md), and [divination](rules/traits/divination.md) traits, to attempt to locate the target, learning the direction to the target as long as you are within 1 mile of it. If the target is a creature or a creature is in possession of the target object, the creature can attempt a Will saving throw against your spell DC. If it succeeds, your attempt to locate the target fails and you can't attempt this again for 1 day. You can only have a single target marked with a sigil modified in this way. If you [Cast this Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) again on a second target, the [sigil](compendium/spells/sigil.md) spell on the first target ends, and your mark fades.
