# Mystery Conduit  *Feat 20*  
[oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md "Oracle Class Trait")  


The power of your mystery enables you to cast more than just revelation spells. When you cast a spell of 5th level or lower that has no duration, instead of spending a spell slot, you can advance the effects of your oracular curse in the same manner as when you cast a revelation spell. A spell cast in this way gains the [cursebound](rules/traits/cursebound-apg.md "Cursebound Spell Trait") trait.
