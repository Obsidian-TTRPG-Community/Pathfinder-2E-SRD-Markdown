# Steal Vitality  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](compendium/feats/spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [vampiric touch](compendium/spells/vampiric-touch.md)

When you cast [vampiric touch](compendium/spells/vampiric-touch.md), you can modify its standard effects as follows: Instead of gaining temporary Hit Points, if your target fails or critically fails its saving throw, you can attempt a counteract check to remove the [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) or [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) conditions on yourself, using the source of that condition to determine the counteract level and DC. If the condition was caused by an ongoing effect and you don't remove that effect, the condition returns at the end of your next turn.
