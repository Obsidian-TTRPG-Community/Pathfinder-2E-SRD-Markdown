# Unnerving Prowess  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Aldori Duelist Dedication](compendium/feats/aldori-duelist-dedication-lowg.md)
- **Trigger** You critically succeed at a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) with your Aldori dueling sword
- **Activity** Free Action

Your incredible skill with your blade unnerves your foes. You attempt to [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) the target of your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md). This [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) attempt does not have the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") trait, nor do you take a penalty to the check if the target doesn't understand your language.
