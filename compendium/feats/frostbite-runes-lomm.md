# Frostbite Runes  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pactbound Dedication](compendium/feats/pactbound-dedication-lomm.md)

Thick tattoos, each one a rune fragment from the saumen kar's long-lost language spelling out their pact with their equally lost deity, cover your body and stretch across your limbs, torso, and face. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against [evil](rules/traits/evil.md) and [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md) spells and effects. You can sense the presence of evil undead as a pervasive taste of oily corruption in the air; this is a vague sense that allows you to know when such  a creature is within 60 feet of you, though you can't precisely pinpoint their location with this sense. As normal for a vague sense, it can be fooled, but undead might not realize they need to take precautions against it. This sense also extends to living creatures who have the [negative healing](rules/abilities/negative-healing-b2.md) ability, like dhampir.
