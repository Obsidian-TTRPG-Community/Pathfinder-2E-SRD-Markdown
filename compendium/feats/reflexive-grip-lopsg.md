# Reflexive Grip  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Swordmaster Dedication](compendium/feats/swordmaster-dedication-locg.md)

You keep hold of your weapons even when knocked out.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC when defending against checks to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) you. In addition, when you fall [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), you don't drop any weapons that you're currently wielding, though somebody else can remove them from you.
