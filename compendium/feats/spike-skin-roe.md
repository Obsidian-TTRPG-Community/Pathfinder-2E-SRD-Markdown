# Spike Skin  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait")  [impulse](rules/traits/impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](rules/traits/kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You touch a willing creature, causing its skin to harden and form spiky protrusions. The target gains resistance 4 to all physical damage (except adamantine). Whenever a creature damages the target with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon, the attacking creature takes 2 piercing damage.

This impulse lasts for 10 minutes, but each time the target takes physical damage, the duration decreases by 1 minute. The target is temporarily immune to this impulse for 1 hour. If you use Spike Skin again, any previous one ends.
