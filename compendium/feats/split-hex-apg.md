# Split Hex  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 18*  
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  [witch](rules/traits/witch-apg.md "Witch Class Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You siphon some of the power from an offensive hex you cast to direct it at a second target as well. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) to cast a harmful hex with a single target, reduce its level by 2 (making it 2 levels lower than the maximum spell level you can cast). If you do, you can select a second target for that hex to affect.
