# Cut The Bonds  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [attack](rules/traits/attack.md "Attack Combat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bellflower Dedication](compendium/feats/bellflower-dedication-aoa3.md), expert in a melee weapon
- **Activity** Single Action

Select a [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") effect that has made an adjacent member of your crop [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy), [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained), or [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed). Attempt a counteract check using your attack modifier (including your multiple attack penalty) with a melee weapon with which you have expert proficiency. Your counteract level is half your level rounded up. On a success, you free that member from the effect; on a failure, you can't attempt to use Cut the Bonds on that effect on that crop member until 24 hours have passed.
