# Vibration Sense  *Feat 4*  
[evolution](rules/traits/evolution-som.md)  [summoner](rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  


Your eidolon gains [tremorsense](rules/abilities/tremorsense.md) as an imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet. If aquatic, it gains [wavesense](rules/abilities/wavesense.md) as an imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet instead. If amphibious, it gains both.
