# Elemental Trade  *Feat 1*  
[oread](rules/traits/oread-b2.md "Oread Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You have a strong connection with stone and metal. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting). If you would automatically become trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [Specialty Crafting](compendium/feats/specialty-crafting.md) skill feat for both Stonemasonry and Blacksmithing.
