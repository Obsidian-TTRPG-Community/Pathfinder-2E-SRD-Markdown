[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Free Action

In a mentally strenuous process, you modify your casting of a spell to take less time. If your next action is to cast a wizard cantrip or a wizard spell that is at least 2 levels lower than the highest level wizard spell you can cast, reduce the number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).
