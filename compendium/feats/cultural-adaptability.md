# Cultural Adaptability  *Feat 5*  
[halfling](rules/traits/halfling.md "Halfling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


During your adventures, you've honed your ability to adapt to the culture of the predominant ancestry around you. You gain the [Adopted Ancestry](compendium/feats/adopted-ancestry.md) general feat, and you also gain one 1st-level ancestry feat from the ancestry you chose for the Adopted Ancestry feat.
