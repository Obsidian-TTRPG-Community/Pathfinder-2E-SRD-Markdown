# Distracting Feint  *Feat 2*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Scoundrel racket

Your [Feints](rules/actions/feint.md) are far more distracting than normal, drawing your foes' attention and allowing you and your allies to take greater advantage. While a creature is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) by your [Feint](rules/actions/feint.md), it also takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks and Reflex saves.
