# Courageous Opportunity  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [bard](rules/traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: warrior muse
- **Trigger** A creature within your reach uses an [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") effect, [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") action, or [move](rules/traits/move.md "Move Combat Trait") action; makes a ranged attack; or leaves a square during its [move](rules/traits/move.md "Move Combat Trait") action.
- **Requirements**: You are affected by [inspire courage](compendium/spells/inspire-courage.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

You bellow a ferocious call to arms, inspiring yourself to lash out at a foe. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") action, the action is disrupted.
