# Warp Space  *Feat 2*  
[amp](rules/traits/amp-da.md "Amp Feat Trait")  [psychic](rules/traits/psychic-da.md "Psychic Class Trait")  


You use your magic to bend space, causing your spell to strike from a strange vector. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry. The amped psi cantrip must have a range.
