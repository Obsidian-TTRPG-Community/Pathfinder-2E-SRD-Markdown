[flourish](rules/traits/flourish.md "Flourish Combat Trait")  [gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You target a specific area of your foe's anatomy to debilitating effect. Declare a part of your foe's anatomy to target and make a ranged weapon [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). If you hit and deal damage, the target takes one of the following effects, based on the body part you targeted. The GM should use the stated effects as a guideline when attacking creatures with stranger anatomy—for instance, applying the "arms" effect to a creature's tentacles if those are what the creature uses to attack.

- **Arms** The target is [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) until the end of your next turn. On a critical hit, it's also [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 minute.
- **Head** The target is [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) until the end of your next turn. On a critical hit, it's also [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 minute.
- **Legs** The target takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds until the end of your next turn. On a critical hit, it also takes a –5-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute.
- **Wings** If the target is flying using its wings, it immediately falls 20 feet, or 40 feet on a critical hit. The fall is gradual enough that if the target hits the ground, it takes no damage from the fall.
