# Flexible Form  *Feat 1*  
[ghoran](rules/traits/ghoran-loil.md "Ghoran Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: any heritage except strong oak

Your body is as supple as a sapling, capable of bending without breaking. You become trained in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics), and if you roll a success to [Squeeze](rules/actions/squeeze.md), you get a critical success instead. If you would automatically become trained in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
