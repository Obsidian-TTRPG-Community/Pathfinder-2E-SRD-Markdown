# Clinging Shadows Initiate  *Feat 8*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: ki spells

You learn a mystical stance that transforms your ki into sticky smoke that shrouds your limbs, clinging to everything you touch. You gain the [clinging shadows stance](compendium/spells/clinging-shadows-stance-apg.md) ki spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. While entering the stance uses a ki spell, the shadow grasp attacks it grants are not, so you can use them as often as you like while in the stance.
