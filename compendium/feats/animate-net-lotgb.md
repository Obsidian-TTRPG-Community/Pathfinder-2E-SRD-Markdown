# Animate Net  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](compendium/feats/spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [animate rope](compendium/spells/animate-rope-apg.md) APG

When you cast [animate rope](compendium/spells/animate-rope-apg.md), you can modify its target to be 1 net. If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You cause a net to animate and throw itself at a Medium or smaller creature within 20 feet of the net. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's Reflex DC. On a success, the target is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) and takes a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it Escapes; on a critical success, it's also [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) until it Escapes. The [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) DC is equal to your spell DC as long as the spell lasts. Once the spell ends, the [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) DC returns to the normal DC for a net (usually 16), and a creature adjacent to the target can [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to remove the net.
