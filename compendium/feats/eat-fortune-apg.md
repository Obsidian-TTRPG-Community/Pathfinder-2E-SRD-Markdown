# Eat Fortune  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 5*  
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [tengu](rules/traits/tengu-b1.md "Tengu Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** A creature within 60 feet uses a [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait") or [misfortune](rules/traits/misfortune.md "Misfortune Effect Trait") effect.
- **Activity** Reaction

As someone tries to twist fate, you consume the interference.

The triggering effect is disrupted. If it's a [misfortune](rules/traits/misfortune.md "Misfortune Effect Trait") effect, Eat Fortune gains the [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait") trait; if it's a [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait") effect, Eat Fortune gains the [misfortune](rules/traits/misfortune.md "Misfortune Effect Trait") trait. This fortune or misfortune applies to the same roll the triggering effect would have, so you couldn't negate a [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait") effect with Eat Fortune and then apply a [misfortune](rules/traits/misfortune.md "Misfortune Effect Trait") effect to the same roll.

## Eat Fortune leads to...
