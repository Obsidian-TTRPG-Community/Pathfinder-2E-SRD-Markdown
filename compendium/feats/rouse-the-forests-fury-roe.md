- **Activity** Three-Action

Terrifying trees attack your enemies. Three Large trees appear in unoccupied spaces within 500 feet, at least 15 feet from one another. Each tree has AC 40, Fortitude +33, Reflex +24, Will +30, and 200 HP. The trees can flank, but are unable to move.

When the trees appear, each makes a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md); they share a multiple attack penalty. The tree's melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) is a branch that has reach 10 feet; on a hit, the target is [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) by the tree ([Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) DC 40). The ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) is a hurled fruit, gourd, seed, or stone with a range increment of 60 feet. Either [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) has a +30 attack modifier and deals `4d10+9` bludgeoning damage.

The trees last until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain the impulse. Each time you Sustain the impulse, you can have one tree make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
