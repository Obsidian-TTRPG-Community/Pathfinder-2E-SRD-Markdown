# Tough Tumbler  *Feat 5*  
[shoony](rules/traits/shoony-ec3.md "Shoony Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Scamper](compendium/feats/scamper-apg.md) Underfoot

You've taken your share of licks while scurrying around the battlefield and know how to defend yourself against opportunistic attackers. Your movement ends only when you critically fail an [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Tumble Through](rules/actions/tumble-through.md) an enemy's space (or when you don't have enough Speed to move all the way through its space). You still trigger reactions on a failure to [Tumble Through](rules/actions/tumble-through.md), but you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against attacks that you trigger in this way.
