# Ricochet Feint  *Feat 12*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ricochet Stance](compendium/feats/ricochet-stance-rogue-apg.md)

While in Ricochet Stance, you can bounce a thrown weapon off a foe to distract them. You can attempt a [Feint](rules/actions/feint.md) against a creature within the first range increment of a thrown weapon you are wielding, rather than only creatures within your melee reach.
