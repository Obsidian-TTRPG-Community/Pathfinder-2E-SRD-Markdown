# Defy Death  *Feat 5*  
[orc](rules/traits/orc.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Orc Ferocity](compendium/feats/orc-ferocity.md)

You're exceptionally difficult to kill. The DC of your recovery checks is equal to 9 + your [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) value, or 8 + your [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) value if you have the [Toughness](compendium/feats/toughness.md) general feat.

In addition, whenever someone returns you to life using magic that would normally leave you debilitated for a week (such as [raise dead](compendium/spells/raise-dead.md) or the [resurrect](compendium/spells/rituals/resurrect.md) ritual), you don't suffer that condition.
