# Tusks  *Feat 1*  
[half-orc](rules/traits/half-orc.md "Half-Orc Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Most half-orcs have visible tusks, but yours are particularly large and sharp, capable of gouging deep wounds. You gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals `1d6` piercing damage.

**Special.** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain out of this feat or into this feat.
