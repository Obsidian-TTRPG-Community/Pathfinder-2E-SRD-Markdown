# Shadow Spell  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [shadow](rules/traits/shadow.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Shadowcaster Dedication](compendium/feats/shadowcaster-dedication-som.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You attach a piece of your shadow to a spell to cloud the senses and cause mischief. If the next action you take is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that has the [shadow](rules/traits/shadow.md) trait, choose one creature affected by the spell. This creature either gains a +2 status bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) or takes a â€“2 status penalty to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) (your choice). This lasts for 1 round. This choice and the effect occur after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects. If the chosen creature is your enemy, it's affected only if your spell attack roll succeeded or if it failed its saving throw.

The effects of Shadow Spell end if you use Shadow Spell again.
