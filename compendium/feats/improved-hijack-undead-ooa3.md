# Improved Hijack Undead  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Clockwork Reanimator Dedication](compendium/feats/clockwork-reanimator-dedication-ooa3.md), [Hijack Undead](compendium/feats/hijack-undead-ooa3.md)

Undead creatures find it all but impossible to resist your commands. When you use [Hijack Undead](compendium/feats/hijack-undead-ooa3.md), if the undead fails its save, it becomes your [minion](rules/traits/minion.md "Minion Creature Trait") for 10 minutes. If it critically fails, it becomes your [minion](rules/traits/minion.md "Minion Creature Trait") for 24 hours.
