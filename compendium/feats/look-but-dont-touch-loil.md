# Look but Don't Touch  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 13*  
[ghoran](rules/traits/ghoran-loil.md)  [poison](rules/traits/poison.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

Many flowers are beautiful to look upon but deadly to touchâ€”and you're one of them. For 1 minute, any creature that touches you or damages you with a melee weapon without the [reach](rules/traits/reach.md) trait or with a melee unarmed attack takes `3d6` poison damage.
