- **Activity** Two-Action

Spinning molten iron through a vortex of fire, you trap your foe in searing wires. Make an impulse attack roll against a creature within 15 feet. On a success, the target takes `2d6` slashing damage and is wrapped in molten wire for 1 minute.

It is [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and takes `2d4` fire damage at the start of each of its turns, with a basic Reflex save. The wire's [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) DC is your class DC. The wire has AC 10 and 75 HP. The impulse ends if the creature Escapes or the wire is destroyed.
