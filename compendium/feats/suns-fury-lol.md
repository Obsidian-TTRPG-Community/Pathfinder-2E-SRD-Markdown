# Sun's Fury  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bright Lion Dedication](compendium/feats/bright-lion-dedication-lol.md)

The Old Sun Gods have granted you a gift in your fight against Walkena. You gain the sun's fury focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) activity to pray to the Old Sun Gods; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your Bright Lion focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, if you aren't already, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability score.
