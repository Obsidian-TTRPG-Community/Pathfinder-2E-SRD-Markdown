# Mortal Healing  *Feat 2*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Godless Healing](compendium/feats/godless-healing-lowg.md), you follow the Laws of Mortality

You grant greater healing when the gods don't interfere.

When you roll a success to [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md) for a creature that hasn't regained Hit Points from divine magic in the past 24 hours, you get a critical success on your check instead and restore the corresponding amount of Hit Points.
