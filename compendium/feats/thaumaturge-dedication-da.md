# Thaumaturge Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [multiclass](rules/traits/multiclass.md "Multiclass Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Charisma 14

You've uncovered basic thaumaturgy. You become trained in thaumaturge class DC. Choose an first implement and esoterica|thaumaturge|DA|1||implement; you can use it to Glimpse Vulnerability, but don't gain its benefits. You also gain a few esoterica, allowing you to use [esoterica](rules/traits/esoterica-da.md "Esoterica Action & Ability Trait") actions. You become trained in your choice of [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion); if you were already trained in these, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the Glimpse Vulnerability action.

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Requirements**: You are holding your implement
