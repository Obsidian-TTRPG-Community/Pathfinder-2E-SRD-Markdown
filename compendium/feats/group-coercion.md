# Group Coercion  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation)

When you [Coerce](rules/actions/coerce.md), you can compare your [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check result to the Will DCs of two targets instead of one. It's possible to get a different degree of success for each target. The number of targets you can [Coerce](rules/actions/coerce.md) in a single action increases to four if you're an expert, 10 if you're a master, and 25 if you're legendary.
