# Emotional Partitions  *Feat 1*  
[kashrishi](rules/traits/kashrishi-loil.md)  


You have created strong mental partitions in your mind to filter out negative emotional influences. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md) effects. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md) effect, you get a critical success instead.
