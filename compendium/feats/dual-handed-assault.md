# Dual-handed Assault  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  [flourish](rules/traits/flourish.md "Flourish Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a one-handed melee weapon and have a free hand.
- **Activity** Single Action

You snap your free hand over to grip your weapon just long enough to add momentum and deliver a more powerful blow to your opponent. Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the required weapon. You quickly switch your grip during the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) in order to make the attack with two hands. If the weapon doesn't normally have the [two-hand](rules/traits/two-hand.md "Two-Hand Weapon Trait") trait, increase its weapon damage die by one step for this attack. (Rules on increasing die size appear on page 279.) If the weapon has the [two-hand](rules/traits/two-hand.md "Two-Hand Weapon Trait") trait, you gain the benefit of that trait and a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the weapon's number of damage dice. When the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) is complete, you resume gripping the weapon with only one hand. This action doesn't end any stance or fighter feat effect that requires you to have one hand free.
