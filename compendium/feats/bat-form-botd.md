# Bat Form  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vampire Dedication](compendium/feats/vampire-dedication-botd.md)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Activity** Single Action

You can transform into a bat. You gain the effects of a 4th-level [pest form](compendium/spells/pest-form.md) spell. At 14th level, you can choose to spend two actions instead of one to gain the effects of a 4th- or 5th-level [aerial form](compendium/spells/aerial-form.md) spell instead (bat form only).
