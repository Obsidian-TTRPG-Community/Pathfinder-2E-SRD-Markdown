# Capture Magic  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md "Magus Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md)
- **Trigger** You succeed at your save against a foe's harmful spell, or a foe fails a spell attack roll against you from a harmful spell.
- **Activity** Reaction

When you resist a spell, you capture some of its magic for your own use. You enter your [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md) stance, using the triggering spell to determine what damage type your [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md) deals. Alternatively, if you're already in [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md), you can instead amplify its effects temporarily. Until the end of your next turn, you gain a +2 status bonus to the damage from your [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md).
