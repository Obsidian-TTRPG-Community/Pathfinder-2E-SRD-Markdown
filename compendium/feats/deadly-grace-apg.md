# Deadly Grace  *Feat 16*  
[swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md "Swashbuckler Class Trait")  


Your graceful attacks are especially powerful. When you score a critical hit with an [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait") or [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait") melee weapon that has the [deadly](rules/traits/deadly.md "Deadly Weapon Trait") trait, you double the number of dice from that trait. When you wield an [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait") or [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait") melee weapon that doesn't have the [deadly](rules/traits/deadly.md "Deadly Weapon Trait") trait, it gains the deadly d8 trait instead.
