# Eye Of The Arclords  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: You are a member of the Arclords of Nex.
- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Arcane Sense](compendium/feats/arcane-sense.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Single Action

You open an incandescent third eye upon your forehead. The eye can remain open for 1 minute, and you can close it before then with a single action with the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait. It can remain open for 2 minutes if you're a master in [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), or 5 minutes if you're legendary. While the eye is open, you gain the following benefits: you gain the effects of the detect magic arcane innate spell from your Arcane Sense at the start of each of your turns without needing to cast the spell; you gain [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md); you gain a +2 status bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) and [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) creatures and to your [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC against [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) and [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md). After your third eye closes, you are [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for an amount of time equal to how long you had it open.
