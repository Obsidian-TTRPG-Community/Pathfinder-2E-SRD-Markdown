# Tumble Behind (Rogue)  *Feat 1*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  


You tumble under and behind your foe to catch them off guard. When you successfully [Tumble Through](rules/actions/tumble-through.md), the foe whose space you passed through is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the next attack you make before the end of your turn.
