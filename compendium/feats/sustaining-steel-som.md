# Sustaining Steel  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 10*  
[arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md)  [healing](rules/traits/healing.md)  [magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md)  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [positive](rules/traits/positive.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md), inexorable iron hybrid study
- **Trigger** You [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) using a spell slot.
- **Requirements**: You're in [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md) stance.
- **Activity** Free Action

You pull magic into your weapon, using its substance to transform the magic into restorative energy. You regain Hit Points equal to double the spell's level and roll to end any [persistent negative damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) you have.

If the spell was of the necromancy school, any [persistent negative damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) you have ends automatically, and you can change the damage type from [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md) to positive if you wish. (Positive damage typically damages only undead or other creatures with [negative healing](rules/abilities/negative-healing-b2.md).).
