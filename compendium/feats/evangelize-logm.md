# Evangelize  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 7*  
[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), you follow a deity or philosophy
- **Activity** Single Action

You point out a detail that incontrovertibly supports your faith, causing a listener's mind to whirl. Attempt a [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check and compare the result to the Will DC of a single target that can hear you and understands your language; that target is then temporarily immune to Evangelize with respect to your deity or philosophy for 1 day. A creature that already agrees with you is unaffected, and at the GM's discretion, a target that genuinely changes its perspective to support your faith as a result of the argument is also otherwise unaffected.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 round.
> - **Success** The target is [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The target is unaffected.
