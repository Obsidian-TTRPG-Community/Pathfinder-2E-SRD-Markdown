# Channel The Godmind  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 17*  
[aphorite](rules/traits/aphorite-loag.md "Aphorite Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You tap into the Godmind's collective cognitive well, rapidly parsing near-infinite variables to read your surroundings. For 1 minute, you gain precise motion sense out to 60 feet, you can see [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creatures and objects, and you gain the effects of a 9th-level [true seeing](compendium/spells/true-seeing.md).
