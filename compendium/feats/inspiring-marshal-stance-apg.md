# Inspiring Marshal Stance  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [open](rules/traits/open.md "Open Combat Trait")  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Marshal Dedication](compendium/feats/marshal-dedication-apg.md), trained in [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy)

You become a brilliant example of dedication and poise in battle, encouraging your allies to follow suit. When you spend this action, attempt a [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.

> - **Success** As critical success, but your aura's size doesn't increase.
> - **Failure** You fail to enter the stance.
> - **Critical Failure** You fail to enter the stance and can't take this action again for 1 minute.
