# Poisoner's Twist  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Poisoner Dedication](compendium/feats/poisoner-dedication-apg.md), trained in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine)
- **Requirements**: Your last action was a successful melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that dealt damage against a target that is afflicted by a poison, and you know which poison.
- **Activity** Single Action

Poisons attack specific parts of the bodyâ€”one venom might target the lungs, another the circulatory system, while another deteriorates the nerves. You know how to take advantage of such weaknesses. You deal `1d6` damage of the required [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)'s damage type and `1d6` poison damage to the target. If you're at least 18th level, you deal `2d6` damage of each type.
