# Core Rejuvenation  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 13*  
[automaton](rules/traits/automaton-g-g.md "Automaton Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You have the [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition and are about to attempt a recovery check.
- **Activity** Free Action

Your soul taps into your core's power to push against the grasp of death and allow you to recover consciousness.

You're restored to 1 Hit Point, lose the [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) and [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) conditions, and can act normally on this turn. You gain or increase the [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition as normal when losing the [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition in this way.

**Enhancement** Your soul can draw even more power from your core, granting you additional benefits. When you use Core Rejuvenation, you also gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to three times your level. These Hit Points remain for 1 minute.
