# Safe Elements  *Feat 4*  
[kineticist](rules/traits/kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  


Elements are wild and dangerous, but you've found ways to reduce their risk. When you [Channel Elements](rules/actions/channel-elements-roe.md) or use a stance impulse that affects your kinetic aura, you can designate a number of creatures up to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 creature). Choose whether they are immune to the benefits of your kinetic aura or immune to its damage and drawbacks. You don't have to be able to see a creature to designate it, nor does it need to be in your kinetic aura, but you can't designate a creature that's [unnoticed](rules/conditions.md#Unnoticed) by you.

In addition, you gain the Pacifying Infusion action.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Pacifying Infusion** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") ([infusion](rules/traits/infusion-roe.md))


If your next action is an impulse, it gains the [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait") trait. If it has an area, you can exclude creatures you've designated with Safe Elements from its effects.
