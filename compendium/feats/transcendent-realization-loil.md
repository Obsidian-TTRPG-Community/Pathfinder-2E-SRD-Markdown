# Transcendent Realization  *Feat 9*  
[kashrishi](rules/traits/kashrishi-loil.md "Kashrishi Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Unlock Secret

You've unleashed even more of your mind's limitless potential. Choose a 3rd-level occult spell, either a common spell or another to which you have access, including a lower-level spell heightened to 3rd level if you wish. You can cast that spell once per day as an innate occult spell.
