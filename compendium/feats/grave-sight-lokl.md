# Grave Sight  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](compendium/feats/lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md), Grave Sense

Your ability to sense undead has improved. You sense undead as an imprecise sense (Core Rulebook 464) with a range of 60 feet: an uncomfortable sensation brushes against your spirit and stinks of rot. When in proximity to an undead, you can sense its presence, but it has the [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) condition instead of the [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed) condition. An undead using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence must attempt a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check against your [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC to hide its presence from you. If the creature succeeds, it's [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected), and you have to use the [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) basic action to detect the creature. As with hearing and other imprecise senses, you still need to [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) to locate an [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) creature.
