[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hellknight Dedication](compendium/feats/hellknight-dedication-locg.md)

You've trained with your order's weapon and your Hellknight plate long enough to apply your expertise from other weapons and armor. If you have expert proficiency in any weapon or unarmed attack, you gain expert proficiency in your order's weapon as well. If you have expert proficiency in any armor or unarmored defense, you gain expert proficiency in Hellknight plate as well.

Hellknight Signifer Signifers are the powerful and enigmatic Hellknight spellcasters who support and sometimes lead other Hellknights on their missions to enforce unwavering law. Formidable in their own right, signifers are trained to be unstoppable forces of order and authority when they stand alongside their martial counterparts.
