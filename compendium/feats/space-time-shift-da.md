# Space-Time Shift  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Chronoskimmer Dedication](compendium/feats/chronoskimmer-dedication-da.md)
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Trigger** Your turn begins.
- **Activity** Free Action

You travel just a few moments into the future to immediately arrive at your destination. Your [Strides](rules/actions/stride.md) are augmented until the end of your turn, allowing you to instantly teleport to any point you could reach with your [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) instead of traversing normally to the location. Your augmented [Strides](rules/actions/stride.md) have the teleport trait and don't trigger reactions that can be triggered by move actions or upon leaving or entering a square. You also augment your [Burrow](rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md), [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) actions in this way if you have the corresponding movement type.
