# Greater Distracting Shot  *Feat 16*  
[ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md "Ranger Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Distracting Shot](compendium/feats/distracting-shot.md)

Even a single missile can throw off your enemy's balance, and more powerful attacks leave it flustered for longer. If you hit your hunted prey with a ranged weapon, it's [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of your next turn. If you critically hit your prey or hit it twice on the same turn with a ranged weapon, it's [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the end of your next turn instead.
