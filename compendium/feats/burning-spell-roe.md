# Burning Spell  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [spellshape](rules/traits/spellshape-roe.md "Spellshape General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Elementalist Dedication](compendium/feats/elementalist-dedication-roe.md), fire is in your elemental philosophy
- **Activity** Single Action

You enhance your spell with elemental fire, causing it to set the target on fire. If the next action you use is to Cast a non- cantrip Spell that deals damage at a single target, the spell deals additional [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to the spell rank, in addition to its other effects. This has no effect if the spell already deals [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). The spell gains the [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait") trait.
