# Grim Insight  *Feat 1*  
[gnome](rules/traits/gnome.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: umbral gnome heritage

Others' attempts to scare you often grant you insights about your would-be bullies that you can then exploit. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a [fear](rules/traits/fear.md) effect, you get a critical success instead, and the source of the [fear](rules/traits/fear.md) effect is flatfooted to you until the end of your next turn.
