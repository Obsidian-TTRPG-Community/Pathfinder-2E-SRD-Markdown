- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

If you have the raw materials available, you can [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) a basic caltrop set, candle, compass, crowbar, fishing tackle, flint and steel, hammer, ladder, piton, rope, 10-foot pole, replacement thieves' picks, long or short tool, or torch without consulting a basic crafter's book.
