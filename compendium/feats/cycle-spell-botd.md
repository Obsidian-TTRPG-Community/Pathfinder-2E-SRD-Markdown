# Cycle Spell  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Soul Warden Dedication](compendium/feats/soul-warden-dedication-botd.md)

Your devotion to the cycle of souls grants you an additional divine spell. Choose from [bless](compendium/spells/bless.md), [disrupting weapons](compendium/spells/disrupting-weapons.md), or [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md). You must make this selection when you take this feat and it can't be changed. Once per day, while your spiral is glowing, you can cast the selected spell as a divine innate spell.
