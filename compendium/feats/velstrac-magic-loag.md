# Velstrac Magic  *Feat 9*  
[tiefling](rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md "Tiefling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Shackleborn](compendium/feats/shackleborn-loag.md)

You know there's so much more to sensation than whips and chainsâ€”but whips and chains also have their place. You can cast [telekinetic maneuver](compendium/spells/telekinetic-maneuver.md) and [web](compendium/spells/web.md) once per day each as 2nd-level divine innate spells; in both cases, the spells manifest shadowy chains rather than their usual visual signifiers.
