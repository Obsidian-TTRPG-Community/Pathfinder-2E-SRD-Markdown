# Whirling Throw  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You have a creature [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained).
- **Activity** Single Action

You propel your [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) foe a great distance. You can throw the creature any distance up to 10 feet, plus 5 feet × your Strength modifier. If you successfully throw the creature, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier plus `1d6` per 10 feet you threw it.

Attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check against the foe's Fortitude DC. You take a –2 circumstance penalty to your check if the target is one size larger than you and a –4 circumstance penalty if it's larger than that. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check if the target is one size smaller than you and a +4 circumstance bonus if it's smaller than that.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You throw the creature the desired distance and it lands [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
> - **Success** You throw the creature the desired distance.
> - **Failure** You don't throw the creature.
> - **Critical Failure** You don't throw the creature, and it's no longer [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by you.
