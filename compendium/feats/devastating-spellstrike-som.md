# Devastating Spellstrike  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md), inexorable iron hybrid study, [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md) stance and your [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) is charged.
- **Activity** Two-Action

Your [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) sweeps are so wide and devastating, they splash onto nearby foes. Make a [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md). Foes adjacent to the target take splash damage equal to 2 + the extra damage from [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md). The damage type is the same as [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md); if the spell already deals splash damage of the same type, combine the damage together before applying weaknesses or resistances.
