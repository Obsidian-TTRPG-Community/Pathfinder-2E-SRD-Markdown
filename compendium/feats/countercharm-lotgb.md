# Countercharm  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Basic Captivator Spellcasting](compendium/feats/basic-captivator-spellcasting-lotgb.md)
- **Trigger** A creature Casts a Spell from the enchantment or illusion school.
- **Requirements**: You have an innate non-cantrip captivator spell of the same school.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your enchantments and illusions are so dominant that you can use them to counteract similar magic cast by others.

When a foe casts an enchantment or illusion spell and you can see its manifestations, you can use your own innate magic to disrupt it. You lose an innate, non-cantrip spell of the same school as the triggering spell as if you had [Cast the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md). You then attempt to counteract the triggering spell with your spell.
