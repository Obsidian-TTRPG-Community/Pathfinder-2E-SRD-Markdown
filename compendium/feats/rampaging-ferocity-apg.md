# Rampaging Ferocity  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 17*  
[orc](rules/traits/orc.md "Orc Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Orc Ferocity](compendium/feats/orc-ferocity.md)
- **Trigger** You use [Orc Ferocity](compendium/feats/orc-ferocity.md).
- **Activity** Free Action

You lash out viciously even as you fend off death. Make a single melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). If this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) brings a foe to 0 Hit Points, this activation of [Orc Ferocity](compendium/feats/orc-ferocity.md) doesn't count against its frequency.
