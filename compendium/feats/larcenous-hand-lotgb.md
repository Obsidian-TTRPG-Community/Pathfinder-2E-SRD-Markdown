# Larcenous Hand  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Agile Hand](compendium/feats/agile-hand-lotgb.md), [Pickpocket](compendium/feats/pickpocket.md) skill feat

When you cast [mage hand](compendium/spells/mage-hand.md), you can remove its duration, modify its range to 20 feet, and modify its target to be an attended object within the spell's Bulk limit that wouldn't be time-consuming to remove. Add the following to the spell's standard effects: If the creature attending the object is willing to have you take the item, mage hand carries the item to you.

If the creature is unwilling, you must attempt to [Steal](rules/actions/steal.md) the target object with a [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check. The usual restrictions on attempts to [Steal](rules/actions/steal.md) an object apply, including the restrictions that you can't steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time-consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects) and you can't [Steal](rules/actions/steal.md) from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard. On a successful [Steal](rules/actions/steal.md) check, the mage hand carries the item to you, and on a critical failure, you can't use this modification again for 1 hour.

If you're a master in [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery), you can attempt to [Steal](rules/actions/steal.md) from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard, though if you do so, the spell's casting time increases by 1 action.
