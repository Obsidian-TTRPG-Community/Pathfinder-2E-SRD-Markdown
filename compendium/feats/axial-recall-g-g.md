# Axial Recall  *Feat 17*  
[automaton](rules/traits/automaton-g-g.md "Automaton Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  


You have reconfigured the magical resonance of your core to attune to the planar energies of Axis. You can cast [plane shift](compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) twice per week as an arcane innate spell that can only target yourself; you can travel only to Axis or the Material Plane, and your body serves as the focus component.
