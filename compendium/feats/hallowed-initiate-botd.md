# Hallowed Initiate  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hallowed Necromancer Dedication](compendium/feats/hallowed-necromancer-dedication-botd.md)

You've expanded your focus spellcasting to techniques used by clerics and wizards. You gain an additional focus spell, either the necromancer school spell [call of the grave](compendium/spells/call-of-the-grave.md) or the initial domain spell of the death domain, [death's call](compendium/spells/deaths-call.md). Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.

**Special.** You can select this feat a second time, choosing the other initial focus spell.
