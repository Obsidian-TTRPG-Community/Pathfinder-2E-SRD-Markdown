# Embodied Legionary Subjectivity  *Feat 1*  
[fleshwarp](rules/traits/fleshwarp-loag.md "Fleshwarp Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: You're from Nex.
- **Prerequisites**: heritage

Nex's Fleshforges shaped you not to achieve individual greatness at arms, but rather to become a part of a legion, a modular piece integral to the combined arms stratagems of Nexian battlemages. You become trained in [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) and [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills, you instead gain the trained rank in another skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Warfare Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).
