# Emotionless  *Feat 1*  
[android](rules/traits/android-loag.md)  


Your malfunctioning emotional processors make it difficult for you to feel strong emotions. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md) and [fear](rules/traits/fear.md) effects. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md) or [fear](rules/traits/fear.md) effect, you get a critical success instead.
