# Emotionless  *Feat 1*  
[android](rules/traits/android-loag.md "Android Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your malfunctioning emotional processors make it difficult for you to feel strong emotions. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") and [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effects. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") or [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effect, you get a critical success instead.
