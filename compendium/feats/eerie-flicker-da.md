# Eerie Flicker  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 2*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [deviant](rules/traits/deviant-da.md "Deviant Action & Ability Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Trigger** A enemy's [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) would hit you and you weren't already [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed), [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden), or [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by that enemy.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your body flickers momentarily into the Ethereal Plane. You become [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) for 1 round, and the flat check for concealment applies to the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that would have hit you. If the flat check fails, the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) misses you.

**Awakening** When your body flickers, you momentarily assume a terrifying form. If a creature fails the flat check against concealment from your Eerie Flicker, it becomes [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened), and it doesn't reduce the [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition from this effect at the end of the same turn it gained the condition.

**Awakening** You can choose to compress your flickering movement into a single moment, increasing your chance to avoid the triggering attack in exchange for a shorter-lived effect. If you choose to do so, the flat check for concealment against the triggering attack increases to DC 9, but the concealment affects only the triggering [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
