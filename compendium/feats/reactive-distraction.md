# Reactive Distraction  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 20*  
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Perfect Distraction](compendium/feats/perfect-distraction.md)
- **Trigger** You would be hit by an attack or targeted by an effect, or you are within an effect's area.
- **Requirements**: You have Perfect Distraction ready to use.
- **Activity** Reaction

You reactively switch with your decoy to foil your foe. You use Perfection Distraction, even if you were [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed), as long as you end the movement of your [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md) while [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) or in a location with cover or greater cover. Your decoy is targeted by the attack or effect instead of you. In the case of an area effect, if your [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md) doesn't move you out of the area, both you and the decoy are targeted by the effect.
