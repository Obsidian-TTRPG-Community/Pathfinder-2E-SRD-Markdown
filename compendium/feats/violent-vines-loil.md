# Violent Vines  *Feat 13*  
[ghoran](rules/traits/ghoran-loil.md)  


When angered, you can imbue nearby vines with your wrath, provoking them into a murderous rampage. Once per hour, you can cast [murderous vine](compendium/spells/murderous-vine-som.md) (Secrets of Magic 117) as a primal innate spell.
