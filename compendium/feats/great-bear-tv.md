# Great Bear  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Ursine Avenger Form
- **Frequency**: once per hour

When you transform, you can take on a bear's bulk and size. You can spend an additional action when using Ursine Avenger Form to gain the effects of a 1st-level [enlarge](compendium/spells/enlarge.md) spell, which lasts for the spell's normal duration or until you leave your Ursine Avenger Form, whichever comes first.
