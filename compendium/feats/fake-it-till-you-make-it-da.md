# Fake It Till You Make It  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Alter Ego Dedication](compendium/feats/alter-ego-dedication-da.md)

When you take on a role, you become more capable with all sorts of tasks involving that role. When you Assume a Role, choose two skills associated with the role in some way; if you're untrained, you can use your level as your proficiency bonus for those skills, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with those skills as long as you remain in that role. You and the GM determine which skills you assume.
