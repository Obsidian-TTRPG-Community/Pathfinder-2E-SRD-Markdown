# Bargain Hunter  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy)

You can [Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md) using [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), spending your days hunting for bargains and reselling at a profit. You can also spend time specifically sniffing out a great bargain on an item; this works as if you were using [Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md) with [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), except instead of gaining money, you purchase the item at a discount equal to the money you would have gained, gaining the item for free if your earned income equals or exceeds its cost. Finally, if you select Bargain Hunter during character creation at 1st level, you start play with an additional 2 gp.
