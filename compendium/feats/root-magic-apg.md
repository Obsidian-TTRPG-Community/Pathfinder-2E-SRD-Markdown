# Root Magic  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism)

Your talismans ward against foul magic. During your daily preparations, you can assemble a small pouch with bits of herbs, hair, sacred oils, and other ritual ingredients, which you give to one ally. The first time that day the ally attempts a saving throw against a spell or haunt, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the roll. This bonus increases to +2 if you're an expert in [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) or +3 if you're legendary.
