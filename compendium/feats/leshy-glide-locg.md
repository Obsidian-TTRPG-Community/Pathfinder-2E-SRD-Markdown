[leshy](rules/traits/leshy-b1.md "Leshy Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: leaf leshy heritage or [Cat Fall](compendium/feats/cat-fall.md) skill feat
- **Activity** Single Action

Using your own leaves, you can control your descent. You glide slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down and up to 25 feet forward through the air. As long as you spend at least 1 action gliding each round and have not yet reached the ground, you remain in the air at the end of your turn.
