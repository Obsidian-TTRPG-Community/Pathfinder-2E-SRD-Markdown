# Wild Strider  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Horizon Walker Dedication](compendium/feats/horizon-walker-dedication-apg.md)

Natural obstacles pose no obstacle to you. You gain the ranger's wild stride class feature. This allows you to ignore the effects of all non-magical difficult terrain, treat greater difficult terrain as merely difficult terrain, and gives you an additional benefit from [Favored Terrain](compendium/feats/favored-terrain.md) based on the terrain.
