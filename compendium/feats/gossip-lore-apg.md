# Gossip Lore  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dandy Dedication](compendium/feats/dandy-dedication-apg.md)

Your time gossiping in fashionable salons keeps you informed on every topic. You are trained in [Gossip Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), a special [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill that can be used only to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), but on any topic. If you fail a check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) with [Gossip Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), you get the effects of the [Dubious Knowledge](compendium/feats/dubious-knowledge.md) skill feat (Core Rulebook 260)

If you have legendary proficiency in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society), you gain expert proficiency in [Gossip Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), but you can't increase your proficiency rank in [Gossip Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) by any other means.
