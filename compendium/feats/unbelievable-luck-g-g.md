# Unbelievable Luck  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication](compendium/feats/unexpected-sharpshooter-dedication-g-g.md)

While no one, not even you, might appear to understand why, you demonstrate a greater ability to hit your targets regardless of the obstacles in your way. You can use the [Accidental Shot](rules/actions/accidental-shot-g-g.md) activity granted to you by the Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication once per hour instead of once per day.
