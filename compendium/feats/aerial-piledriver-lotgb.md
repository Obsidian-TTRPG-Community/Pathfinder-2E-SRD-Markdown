# Aerial Piledriver  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [attack](rules/traits/attack.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Wrestler Dedication](compendium/feats/wrestler-dedication-lotgb.md)
- **Requirements**: You have a creature [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained).
- **Activity** Two-Action

Heaving both yourself and your opponent into the air, you bring them crashing to the ground. Make an unarmed melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the creature you have [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained).

This [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) deals `1d6` additional damage per weapon damage die, and it has the following additional effects on a success, failure, and critical failure.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target lands [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
> - **Failure** You lose your grip on the target, and it is no longer [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by you.
> - **Critical Failure** You lose both your grip on the target and your balance. You fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone), and the target is no longer [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by you.
