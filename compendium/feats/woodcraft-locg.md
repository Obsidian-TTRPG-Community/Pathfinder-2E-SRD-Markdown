# Woodcraft  *Feat 1*  
[elf](rules/traits/elf.md "Elf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You have a innate familiarity with forested areas. When in a forest or jungle environment, if you roll a critical failure on a [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) skill check to [Sense Direction](rules/actions/sense-direction.md), [Subsist](rules/actions/subsist.md), or [Cover Tracks](rules/actions/cover-tracks.md), you get a failure instead, and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
