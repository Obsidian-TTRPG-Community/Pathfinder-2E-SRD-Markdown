# Eye For Treasure  *Feat 1*  
[dwarf](rules/traits/dwarf.md "Dwarf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You know good artisanship when you see it and can wax poetic about crafting techniques and forms.

You become trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) and gain a +1 circumstance bonus on all [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) checks made to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md).

If you would automatically become trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. In addition, you gain the [Crafter's Appraisal](compendium/feats/crafters-appraisal-apg.md) skill feat, enabling you to identify magic items using the [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) skill.
