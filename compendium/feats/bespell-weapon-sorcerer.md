# Bespell Weapon (Sorcerer)  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 4*  
[sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per turn
- **Requirements**: Your most recent action was to cast a non-cantrip spell.
- **Activity** Free Action

You siphon the residual energy from the last spell you cast into one weapon you're wielding. Until the end of your turn, the weapon deals an extra `1d6` damage of a type depending on the school of the spell you just cast.

- **Abjuration** force damage
- **Conjuration or Transmutation** the same type as the weapon
- **Divination, Enchantment, or Illusion** mental damage
- **Evocation** a type the spell dealt, or force damage if the spell didn't deal damage
- **Necromancy** negative damage
