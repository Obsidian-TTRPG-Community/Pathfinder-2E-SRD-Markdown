# Stasian Smash  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: You are from Ustalav.
- **Prerequisites**: [Sterling Dynamo Dedication](compendium/feats/sterling-dynamo-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You've modified your dynamo with Stasian coils, allowing you to make a powerful attack that crackles with electricity.

Make a dynamo [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). On a success, the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) deals an additional `1d12` electricity damage to the target, as well as `1d4` electricity damage to up to two other foes within 10 feet as sparks leap across the gaps. If you critically fail your dynamo [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), you take `1d12` electricity damage. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty.

At 18th level, the additional electricity damage to the target increases to `2d12`, and the additional electricity damage to the other foes increases to `2d4`. Reduce the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour.
