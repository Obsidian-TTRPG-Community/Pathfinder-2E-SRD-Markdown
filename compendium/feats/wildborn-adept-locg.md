# Wildborn Adept  *Feat 5*  
[elf](rules/traits/elf.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Wildborn Magic](compendium/feats/wildborn-magic-locg.md)

The whispers of the jungle grant you more diverse access to simple primal magic. You can cast [dancing lights](compendium/spells/dancing-lights.md), disrupt undead, and tanglefoot as innate primal spells at will.

If you chose one of those spells with Wildborn Magic, you can select a new spell for Wildborn Magic.
