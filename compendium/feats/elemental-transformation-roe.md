# Elemental Transformation  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[kineticist](rules/traits/kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: exactly one kinetic element
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Requirements**: Your kinetic gate is deactivated.
- **Activity** Single Action

You open your kinetic gate, but rather than activating your kinetic aura, you instead become overwhelmed with transformative elemental energy. You're affected by an [elemental form](compendium/spells/elemental-form.md) spell with the same trait as your kinetic element. You can heighten it to any spell rank up to half your level rounded up.
