# Impossible Striker  *Feat 20*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sly Striker](compendium/feats/sly-striker.md)

Your attacks are swift and deadly beyond explanation. Nothing can prevent you from making a sneak attack, even if your opponent can see every blow coming. Instead of dealing the damage from Sly Striker, you can deal your full sneak attack damage to a target even if the target isn't [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed).
