# Adaptive Vision  *Feat 1*  
[dwarf](rules/traits/dwarf.md "Dwarf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

After years of using black powder weaponry in dimly lit spaces, you've become accustomed to dazzling flashes of light and sudden shifts in illumination. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") effects.

If you roll a success on a saving throw against a [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") effect, you get a critical success instead.
