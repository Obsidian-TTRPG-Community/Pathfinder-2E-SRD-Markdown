# Reckless Abandon (Barbarian)  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 16*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Trigger** Your turn begins, and you are at half or fewer Hit Points.
- **Activity** Free Action

Your blood boils when you take a beating, and you throw caution to the wind to finish the fight. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls, a –2 penalty to AC, and a –1 penalty to saves. These bonuses and penalties last until your [Rage](rules/actions/rage.md) ends or until you are above half Hit Points, whichever comes first.
