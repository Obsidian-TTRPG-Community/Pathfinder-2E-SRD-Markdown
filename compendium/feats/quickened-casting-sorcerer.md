[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md "Sorcerer Class Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Free Action

In a mentally strenuous process, you modify your casting of a spell to take less time. If your next action is to cast a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell that is at least 2 levels lower than the highest level sorcerer spell you can cast, reduce the number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).
