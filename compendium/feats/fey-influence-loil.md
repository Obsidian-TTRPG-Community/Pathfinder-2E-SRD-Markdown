# Fey Influence  *Feat 5*  
[rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  


You have been exposed to powerful fey magic. You become trained in primal DCs and spell attack rolls. You gain the [fey](rules/traits/fey.md) trait and one of the following features that grants an innate primal spell that can be used once per day.

- **Anteater** You can launch your tongue forward as a deadly attack, gaining [grim tendrils](compendium/spells/grim-tendrils.md).
- **Cat Sith** You have catlike features and can appear as a mundane cat with [pest form](compendium/spells/pest-form.md) (cat only).
- **Cursed Bluebird** You have blue feathers or wings. It's terrible luck to harm a bluebird, and you can manifest that power as ill omen.
- **Dryad** Your body is covered in elegant vines, granting you [summon plant or fungus](compendium/spells/summon-plant-or-fungus.md).
- **Faun** Your legs and feet are swift and possibly hooved, granting you [fleet step](compendium/spells/fleet-step.md).
- **Gremlin** You have long, bat-like ears and gain [bane](compendium/spells/bane.md).
- **Monarch** You have vestigial, insectile features and gain [spider sting](compendium/spells/spider-sting.md).
- **Unicorn** You have a magical horn or a prominent symbol of one on your forehead, which you can use to cast [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md).

**Special.** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for human, goblin for goblin, etc.).
