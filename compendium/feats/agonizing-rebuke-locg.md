# Agonizing Rebuke  *Feat 5*  
[hobgoblin](rules/traits/hobgoblin-locg.md)  


When you terrorize your enemies, you also cause them painful mental distress.

When you successfully [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) a foe, that foe takes `1d4` mental damage at the start of each of its turns as long as it remains [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) and continues to engage in combat with you. If you have master proficiency in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), the damage increases to `2d4`, and if you have legendary proficiency, the damage increases to `3d4`.
