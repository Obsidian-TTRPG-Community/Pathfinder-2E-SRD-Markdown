# Burning Spell  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Elementalist Dedication](compendium/feats/elementalist-dedication-som.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You enhance your spell with elemental fire, causing it to set the target on fire. If the next action you use is to [Cast a non-cantrip Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that deals damage at a single target, the spell deals additional [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to the spell level, in addition to its other effects. This has no effect if the spell already deals [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). The spell gains the [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait") trait.
