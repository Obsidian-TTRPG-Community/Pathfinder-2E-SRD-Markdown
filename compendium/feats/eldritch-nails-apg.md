# Eldritch Nails  *Feat 4*  
[witch](rules/traits/witch-apg.md "Witch Class Trait")  


Your nails are supernaturally long and sharp. You gain a nails unarmed attack that deals `1d6` slashing damage. Your nails are in the brawling group and have the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait") and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits.

You can etch your nails with runes with the same cost and restrictions as for etching runes onto handwraps of mighty blows; runes etched onto your nails apply to nails unarmed attacks with both hands but not to other unarmed attacks.

You can deliver hexes through your nails. When you successfully cast a non-cantrip hex that requires 2 actions or more to cast and that doesn't require a spell attack roll, if your target is within your reach, as part of the spellcasting activity you can make a nails [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the foe before applying any effects of the hex. If this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) misses, the hex has no effect.
