# Emissary of Peace  [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Vigilant Dedication](compendium/feats/knight-vigilant-dedication-locg.md), master in [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy)
- **Activity** Three-Action

Even when bloodshed is inevitable, you would rather see your foes surrender. You attempt a [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) against a single foe whose Hit Points are at less than half of their maximum value, followed by an immediate [Request](rules/actions/request.md) to convince that creature to cease fighting. You take a â€“5 penalty to your [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check. The GM sets the DC of the [Request](rules/actions/request.md) based on the circumstances; it's generally at least a very hard DC for the creature's level. Some creatures might simply refuse, and those who agree to parley might find your arguments lacking and start fighting again.
