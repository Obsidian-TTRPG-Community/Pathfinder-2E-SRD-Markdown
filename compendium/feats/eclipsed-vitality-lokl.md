# Eclipsed Vitality  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Assassin Dedication](compendium/feats/assassin-dedication-apg.md) or [Scout Dedication](compendium/feats/scout-dedication-apg.md), master in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth)

You shroud yourself in ashes that hide the vital essence sought by life-sensing undead. You're always taking precautions when [Avoiding Notice](rules/actions/avoid-notice.md), Hiding, and Sneaking to foil lifesense, and you're [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to any creature using only precise lifesense to observe you.
