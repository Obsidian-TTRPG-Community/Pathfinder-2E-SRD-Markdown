# Vicious Incisors  *Feat 1*  
[ratfolk](rules/traits/ratfolk-b1.md "Ratfolk Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You've let your incisors grow long enough to serve as formidable weapons. You gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals `1d6` piercing damage. Your jaws are in the brawling group and have the [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait") and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits. Unlike most creatures, you can file down your teeth and regrow them later on, enabling you to select this feat at any level, and to retrain into and out of this feat.
