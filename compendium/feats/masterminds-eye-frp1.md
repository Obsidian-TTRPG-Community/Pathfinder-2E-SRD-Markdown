# Mastermind's Eye  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Butterfly Blade Dedication](compendium/feats/butterfly-blade-dedication-frp1.md)

When you succeed at identifying a creature using [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), that creature is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your attacks until the start of your next turn; if you critically succeed, it's [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your attacks for 1 minute. This feat serves as the rogue's mastermind racket for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.
