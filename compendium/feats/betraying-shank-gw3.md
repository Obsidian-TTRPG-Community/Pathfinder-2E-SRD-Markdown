# Betraying Shank  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Twilight Speaker Dedication
- **Requirements**: You are within melee reach of a target, but it is not in combat with you.
- **Activity** Single Action

While your usual diplomacy is well intentioned, you know that sometimes those same skills will need to be turned to deception. In a flash, you draw a sheathed or [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) agile or finesse weapon and make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). The target is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). You then roll [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) for initiative.
