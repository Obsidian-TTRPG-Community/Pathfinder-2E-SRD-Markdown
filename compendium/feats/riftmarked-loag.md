# Riftmarked  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  [tiefling](rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md "Tiefling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Long ago, [qlippoth](rules/traits/qlippoth-b2.md "Qlippoth Creature Trait") marked someone in your lineage, most likely through their ancient runestones that dot Golarion's surface. Yours is an old lineage, primordial and twisted, and you have a sense for similarly twisted things. You're trained in [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism). If you're already trained in [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the [Oddity Identification](compendium/feats/oddity-identification.md) skill feat.

## Riftmarked leads to...

[Qlippoth Magic](compendium/feats/qlippoth-magic-loag.md)
