# Cast Out  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Exorcist Dedication](compendium/feats/exorcist-dedication-botd.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You attempt to cast a malevolent entity out of the creature or object it's possessing. Roll a counteract check against the [possession](rules/traits/possession.md) effect; you must be within 30 feet of the possessed creature or object to do so. Your counteract level is half your level rounded up, and your counteract modifier is your [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) modifier, [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) modifier, or spell DC â€“ 10, whichever is highest. If you succeed, the entity is driven out and can't attempt to possess that creature or object for 1 week. If you fail, the possessing creature is immune to your Cast Out for a year and a day.
