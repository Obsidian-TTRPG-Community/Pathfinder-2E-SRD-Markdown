[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")

- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a tall and proud stance while remaining mobile, with all the grace and composure of a peafowl. While in this stance, the only [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) you can make are melee [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) with the required sword. Once per round, after you hit with a monk sword [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), you can [Step](rules/actions/step.md) as a free action as your next action.
