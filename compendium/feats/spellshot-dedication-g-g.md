# Spellshot Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [class](rules/traits/class-som.md "Class Class Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: way of the spellshot

You've steeped yourself in magic and gunplay to the extent that you can conjure bullets from thin air, using a rudimentary knowledge of arcane theory to create a temporary piece of ammunition. You gain the Conjure Bullet action.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Conjure Bullet [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

You conjure an ordinary level-0 bolt or bullet out of thin air and then immediately Interact to load it into your weapon. If the bolt or bullet isn't fired before the end of your turn, the effect is wasted.  
%% #trait/conjuration #trait/magical %%
```

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat other than Beast Gunner Dedication until you've gained two other feats from the [spellshot](compendium/character/archetypes/spellshot-g-g.md) or [beast gunner](compendium/character/archetypes/beast-gunner-g-g.md) archetypes.
