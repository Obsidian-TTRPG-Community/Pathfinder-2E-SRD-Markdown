# Tracing Sigil  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](compendium/feats/spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [sigil](compendium/spells/sigil.md)

When you cast [sigil](compendium/spells/sigil.md), you can modify the spell to add the following to its standard effects: The target leaves a magical trail that you and others can try to follow. You and other creatures can attempt to [Track](rules/actions/track.md) the target, substituting an [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) check (whichever matches the magical tradition of your [sigil](compendium/spells/sigil.md) spell) for the [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) check. Much like [Tracking](rules/actions/track.md) with [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival), this must take place somewhere the target has been and follow the trail; it doesn't allow anyone to find the target from a distance. You can only have a single target marked with a modified sigil in this way. If you use this ability again on a second target, the [sigil](compendium/spells/sigil.md) spell on the first target ends, and your mark fades.

## Tracing Sigil leads to...

[Beacon Mark](compendium/feats/beacon-mark-lotgb.md)
