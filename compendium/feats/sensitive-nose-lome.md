# Sensitive Nose  *Feat 1*  
[gnoll](rules/traits/gnoll-b1.md)  


Your large black nose isn't just for show. You gain imprecise [scent](rules/abilities/scent.md) with a range of 30 feet.

**Special.** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain out of this feat or into this feat.
