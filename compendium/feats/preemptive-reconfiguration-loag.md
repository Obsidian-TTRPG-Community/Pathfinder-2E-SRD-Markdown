# Preemptive Reconfiguration  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 9*  
[aphorite](rules/traits/aphorite-loag.md "Aphorite Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You would take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your body anticipates the blow. The impact area briefly reorganizes into a strengthened tissue lattice that blunts the attack. You gain resistance equal to your level to the triggering damage type, which applies against the triggering damage.

If you have the [Crystalline Dust](compendium/feats/crystalline-dust-loag.md) feat, you can use Preemptive Reconfiguration without expending a usage of the reaction for the purpose of the feat's Frequency limit. Instead, the usage counts toward your number of [Crystalline Dust](compendium/feats/crystalline-dust-loag.md) uses per day, as if you had used that feat instead.
