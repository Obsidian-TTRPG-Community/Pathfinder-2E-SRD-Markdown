# Become Thought  *Feat 20*  
[psychic](rules/traits/psychic-da.md "Psychic Class Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  


You shed some of your material form, becoming a being of pure thought. This has the following effects.

- You gain resistance 10 to physical damage but weakness 5 to mental damage and weakness 10 to [any](rules/traits/any-b1.md "Any Alignment Trait") effect that deals damage by targeting the spirit, such as spirit blast.
- You can change your appearance on a whim. This takes a single action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait, has the effects of illusory disguise, and lasts until you change your appearance again.
- Once per year, when you die, you automatically return to life the next day as long as one living sentient creature on your plane remembers you; the memories enable you to reconstruct yourself from their thoughts. You appear in the vicinity of the creature that remembers you most strongly.
