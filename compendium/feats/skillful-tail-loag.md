You were born with a tail, and with practice you've learned how to perform simple [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions with it, such as opening an unlocked door. Your tail can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish, and you can't use it to hold items.
