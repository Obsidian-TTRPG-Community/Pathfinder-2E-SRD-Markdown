# Vishkanya Lore  *Feat 1*  
[vishkanya](rules/traits/vishkanya-loil.md "Vishkanya Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You deeply understand vishkanyan strengths and cultural traditions. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) and [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Vishkanya Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).
