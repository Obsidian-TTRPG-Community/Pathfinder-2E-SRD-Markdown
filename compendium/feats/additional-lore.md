# Additional Lore  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore)

Your knowledge has expanded to encompass a new field. Choose an additional [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill subcategory. You become trained in it. At 3rd, 7th, and 15th levels, you gain an additional skill increase you can apply only to the chosen [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) subcategory.

**Special.** You can select this feat more than once. Each time you must select a new subcategory of [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) and you gain the additional skill increases to that subcategory for the listed levels.
