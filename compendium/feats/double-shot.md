# Double Shot  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  [flourish](rules/traits/flourish.md "Flourish Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a ranged weapon with [reload <0>](rules/traits/reload-0.md "Reload Weapon Trait").
- **Activity** Two-Action

You shoot twice in blindingly fast succession. Make two [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), each against a separate target and with a â€“2 penalty. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both of them.

## Double Shot leads to...

[Triple Shot](compendium/feats/triple-shot.md), [Multishot Stance](compendium/feats/multishot-stance.md)
