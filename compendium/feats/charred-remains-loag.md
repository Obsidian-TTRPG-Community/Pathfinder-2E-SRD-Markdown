Your next fire spell leaves embers in its wake. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with an area and the [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait") trait, for 1 minute, your spell's area becomes difficult terrain as well as hazardous terrain, dealing 1 fire damage for each square a creature moves through.
