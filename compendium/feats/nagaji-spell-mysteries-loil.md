[nagaji](rules/traits/nagaji-loil.md "Nagaji Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: at least one innate spell from a nagaji heritage or ancestry feat

You've learned more naga magic. During your daily preparations, choose [charm](compendium/spells/charm.md), [fleet step](compendium/spells/fleet-step.md), or [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md). You can cast the chosen spell as a 1st-level occult innate spell once that day.
