# Sanctify Water  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 7*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion), good or evil deity
- **Activity** Single Action

You imbue water with your deity's blessing. Choose a container of water on your person that is of light Bulk. For 1 round, if you or an ally throw this container at a foe, it has the damaging effects of holy water (if you follow a good deity) or unholy water (if you follow an evil deity). The water's transient power doesn't make it gain any value, allow it to be used to supply the cost for a spell or ritual, and so on. If you have legendary proficiency in [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion), you can sanctify three containers held by you or allies within your reach instead of one.
