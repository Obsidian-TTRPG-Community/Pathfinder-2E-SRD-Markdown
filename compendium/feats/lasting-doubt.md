# Lasting Doubt  *Feat 12*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Redeemer cause

When you cast doubt upon your foes, the effect lasts longer than usual. After being [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) by your [Glimpse of Redemption](rules/actions/glimpse-of-redemption.md), the foe is [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 minute. If you have [Weight of Guilt](compendium/feats/weight-of-guilt.md), after being [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) by your [Glimpse of Redemption](rules/actions/glimpse-of-redemption.md), the foe is [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 minute or until the flat check from [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) causes it to lose a spell, whichever comes first.
