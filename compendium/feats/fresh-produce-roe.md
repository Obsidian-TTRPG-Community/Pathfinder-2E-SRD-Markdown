- **Activity** Single Action

You grow a nourishing nut, vegetable, seed, or fruit. Choose a creature in your kinetic aura. The produce grows in their open hand, or at their feet if they have no open hands. The produce has light Bulk. A creature can eat it with an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to regain `1d4+1` HP; this is a healing vitality effect. The creature feels full for 10 minutes, during which it has resistance 2 to void damage and can't eat another piece of produce. Produce not consumed by the start of your next turn withers away.
