# Keep Up the Good Fight  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Vigilant Dedication](compendium/feats/knight-vigilant-dedication-locg.md)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger** A foe's [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) reduces you to 0 Hit Points.
- **Requirements**: You had more than 1 Hit Point before the triggering [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), and the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) wouldn't kill you.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your devotion to helping others and doing good keeps you going, even against insurmountable odds. Instead of being knocked out, you are reduced to 1 Hit Point, gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level for 1 round, and increase your [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) value by 1.
