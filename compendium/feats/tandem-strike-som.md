# Tandem Strike  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[summoner](rules/traits/summoner-som.md "Summoner Class Trait")  [tandem](rules/traits/tandem-som.md "Tandem Action & Ability Trait")  

- **Requirements**: A creature is in your and your eidolon's reach.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You and your eidolon each attack, seamlessly targeting the same foe without interfering with each other's movements.

Your eidolon makes a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), and then you make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the same creature. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after both attacks have been made.
