[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Expert Captivator Spellcasting](compendium/feats/expert-captivator-spellcasting-lotgb.md)

You master the most powerful spells that enchant and deceive.

You learn a 7th-level occult spell. At 18th level, you learn an 8th-level spell spell, and at 20th level, you learn a 9th-level spell.

Each of these spells must come from either the enchantment or illusion school. You cast these spells as occult innate spells.

You become a master with spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells.
