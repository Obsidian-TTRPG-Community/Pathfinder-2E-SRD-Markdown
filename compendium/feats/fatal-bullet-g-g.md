# Fatal Bullet  *Feat 16*  
[gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  


You're especially talented at striking your enemies in their most vulnerable areas.

When you critically hit with a fatal firearm, you deal an additional die of the appropriate size and damage type for the [fatal](rules/traits/fatal.md "Fatal Weapon Trait") trait after doubling the weapon's damage. For example, after getting a critical hit with a fatal <d12> weapon, you add an additional `1d12` damage to the attack after doubling its damage.
