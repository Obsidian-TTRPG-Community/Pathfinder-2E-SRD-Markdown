# Orc Weapon Carnage  *Feat 5*  
[orc](rules/traits/orc.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Orc Weapon Familiarity](compendium/feats/orc-weapon-familiarity.md)

You are brutally efficient with the weapons of your orc ancestors. Whenever you critically hit using a [falchion](compendium/equipment/items/falchion.md), a [greataxe](compendium/equipment/items/greataxe.md), or an orc weapon, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect.
