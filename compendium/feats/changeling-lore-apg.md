# Changeling Lore  *Feat 1*  
[changeling](rules/traits/changeling-b1.md "Changeling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


All too aware of your true nature, you've studied hags and their powers. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) and [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Hag Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).
