# Greater Cruelty  *Feat 8*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cruelty](compendium/feats/cruelty-apg.md)

The extent of the corruption within you does more than simply sap your foes' strength, it devastates their minds and reflexes. When you use Cruelty, choose whether you want to make the creature [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) as normal, to make it [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) on a failed save ([clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) on a critical failure), or to make it [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) on a failed save ([stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) on a critical failure).
