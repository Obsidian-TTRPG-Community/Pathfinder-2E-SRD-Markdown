# Diviner Sense  *Feat 12*  
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md "Wizard Class Trait")  


You sense magical dangers. When using the [Detect Magic](rules/actions/detect-magic.md) exploration activity, you can roll initiative twice and use the better result so long as at least one opponent has a [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") effect or magic item and is in range of your [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md).
