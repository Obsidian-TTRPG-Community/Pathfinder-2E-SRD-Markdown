# Diviner Sense  *Feat 12*  
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md)  [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md)  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md)  


You sense magical dangers. When using the [Detect Magic](rules/actions/detect-magic.md) exploration activity, you can roll initiative twice and use the better result so long as at least one opponent has a [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) effect or magic item and is in range of your [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md).
