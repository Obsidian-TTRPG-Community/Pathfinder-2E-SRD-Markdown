- **Prerequisites**: [Scrollmaster Dedication](compendium/feats/scrollmaster-dedication-locg.md)

Experience or focused study have granted you mastery of a number of topics.

When you know about something, you know about it in great detail. When you succeed at a check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), you gain additional information or context. When you critically succeed at a check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), at the GM's discretion, you might gain even more additional information or context than normal.

Spellmaster Those who train under the Master of Spells concern themselves with all matters related to magic. Though not all members of the School of Spells are spellcasters, those who would become Spellmasters of the highest rank and influence have at least some spellcasting capabilities.
