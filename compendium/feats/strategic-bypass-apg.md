# Strategic Bypass  *Feat 14*  
[investigator](rules/traits/investigator-apg.md "Investigator Class Trait")  


Your plans account for your foes' resistances, enabling you to strike a telling blow. When you hit with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) on which you substituted your attack roll due to [Devising a Stratagem](rules/actions/devise-a-stratagem-apg.md), you ignore an amount of resistance equal to your Intelligence modifier for each resistance that applies against your attack.
