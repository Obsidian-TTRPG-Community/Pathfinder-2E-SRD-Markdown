[automaton](rules/traits/automaton-g-g.md "Automaton Ancestry & Heritage Trait")

Your core allows you to draw more power from it. Select one 1st-level arcane spell and one 2nd-level or lower arcane spell, to which you have access. You can cast your chosen spells as arcane innate spells each once per day.

**Enhancement** Your attunement grows stronger. Select one 5th-level or lower arcane spell and one 6th-level or lower arcane spell, to which you have access. You can cast them as arcane innate spells each once per day, in addition to the original spells.
