# Expand Spiral  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spiral Sworn](compendium/feats/spiral-sworn-botd.md)

Your prayers encompass your companions, granting you the ability to share [Pharasma](compendium/setting/deities/pharasma.md)'s blessings. When you use [Spiral Sworn](compendium/feats/spiral-sworn-botd.md), you can spend 2 actions instead of 1 to grant the benefits to all allies who are in the light of your spiral when you take the action.
