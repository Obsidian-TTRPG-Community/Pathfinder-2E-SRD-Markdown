# Giant's Lunge  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [instinct](rules/traits/instinct.md "Instinct Action & Ability Trait")  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Giant instinct
- **Activity** Single Action

You extend your body and prepare to attack foes outside your normal reach. Until your rage ends, all your melee weapons and unarmed attacks gain [reach <10>](rules/traits/reach-10.md "Reach Weapon Trait"). This doesn't increase the reach of any weapon or unarmed attack that already has the [reach](rules/traits/reach.md "Reach Weapon Trait") trait, but it does combine with abilities that increase your reach due to increased size, such as [Giant's Stature](compendium/feats/giants-stature.md).
