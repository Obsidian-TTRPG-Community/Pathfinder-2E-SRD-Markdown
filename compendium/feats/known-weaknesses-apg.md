# Known Weaknesses  *Feat 1*  
[investigator](rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  


Whenever you [Devise a Stratagem](rules/actions/devise-a-stratagem-apg.md), you can also attempt a check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) as part of that action. If you critically succeed at the [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) check, you notice a weakness and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll from [Devise a Stratagem](rules/actions/devise-a-stratagem-apg.md). If you immediately convey this information to your allies as part of the check, each ally gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their next attack roll against the subject, as long as their attack is made before the beginning of your next turn.
