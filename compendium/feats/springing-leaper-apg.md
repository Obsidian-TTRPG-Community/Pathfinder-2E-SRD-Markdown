You can [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) as a 2-action activity to double the distance you can [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) vertically, or [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) as a 3-action activity to triple the distance you can [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) vertically. You don't automatically fail [Long Jumps](rules/actions/long-jump.md) for jumping in a different direction than your [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md).
