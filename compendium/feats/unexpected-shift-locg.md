# Unexpected Shift  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[gnome](rules/traits/gnome.md "Gnome Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Trigger** You would take damage from an attack, spell, or other effect.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your supernatural connection sometimes causes you to phase from reality when under threat, disappearing for split seconds before reappearingâ€”often surprising you as much as your enemies. Roll a DC 16 flat check. On a success, you gain resistance to all damage equal to your level against the triggering effect, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against that effect until the start of your turn, and you gain the [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) condition for 1 round.
