# Elven Weapon Elegance  *Feat 5*  
[elf](rules/traits/elf.md "Elf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Elven Weapon Familiarity](compendium/feats/elven-weapon-familiarity.md)

You are attuned to the weapons of your elven ancestors and are particularly deadly when using them. Whenever you critically hit using an elf weapon or one of the weapons listed in [Elven Weapon Familiarity](compendium/feats/elven-weapon-familiarity.md), you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect.
