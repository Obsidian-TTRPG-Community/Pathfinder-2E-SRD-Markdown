# Sure Feet  *Feat 1*  
[halfling](rules/traits/halfling.md)  


Whether keeping your balance or scrambling up a tricky climb, your hairy, calloused feet easily find purchase. If you roll a success on an [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Balance](rules/actions/balance.md) or an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md), you get a critical success instead.

You're not [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) when you attempt to [Balance](rules/actions/balance.md) or [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md).
