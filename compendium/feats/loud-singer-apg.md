# Loud Singer  *Feat 5*  
[goblin](rules/traits/goblin.md "Goblin Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Goblin Song](compendium/feats/goblin-song.md)

Staying on pitch, proper breath control, and remembering the words are all less important than the real measure of a good singer: volume! The range of your Goblin Song is increased to 60 feet, and you can target one additional enemy when you use it.
