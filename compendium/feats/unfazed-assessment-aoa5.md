# Unfazed Assessment  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Zephyr Guard Dedication](compendium/feats/zephyr-guard-dedication-aoa5.md), expert in [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception)
- **Activity** Single Action

You have witnessed hundreds of fighting styles and quickly adapt to defend against complicated maneuvers. Choose a creature within 30 feet who you're aware of, and attempt a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check against that target's Will DC. If you succeed, you size up their fighting style, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saving throws against that creature's attacks (or a +2 circumstance bonus for a critical success). These benefits last until the end of your next turn.
