# Sever Magic  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 16*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait")  [esoterica](rules/traits/esoterica-da.md "Esoterica Action & Ability Trait")  [thaumaturge](rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md "Thaumaturge Class Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You're holding an implement.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You apply a frayed thread, a pinch of fulu ash, or a similar undone charm to your weapon, and swing to break a spell. Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against an enemy. If you hit and deal damage, you attempt to counteract a single spell active on the target (your choice). Your counteract level is equal to half your level (rounded up), and your counteract check modifier is equal to your class DC â€“ 10.
