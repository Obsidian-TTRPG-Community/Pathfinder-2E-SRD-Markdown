# Pirate Weapon Training  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pirate Dedication](compendium/feats/pirate-dedication-apg.md)

You're particularly skilled at wielding traditional pirate weapons. You become trained with the following weapons: [hatchet](compendium/equipment/items/hatchet.md), [rapier](compendium/equipment/items/rapier.md), [scimitar](compendium/equipment/items/scimitar.md), and [whip](compendium/equipment/items/whip.md). Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency with a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank for these weapons.
