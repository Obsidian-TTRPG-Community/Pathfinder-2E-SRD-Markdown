# Viking Shieldbearer  *Feat 1*  
[human](rules/traits/human.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Ulfen ethnicity

You trained with shields and weapons as soon as you were old enough to hold them, eager to win honor and glory for yourself. You gain the [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) reaction and are trained in your choice of the battle axe or longsword.
