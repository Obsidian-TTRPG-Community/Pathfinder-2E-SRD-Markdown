# Mighty Bulwark  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sentinel Dedication](compendium/feats/sentinel-dedication-apg.md)

Thanks to your incredible connection to your armor, you can use it to shrug off an incredible array of dangers. Your bonus from the bulwark armor trait increases from +3 to +4, and it applies on all Reflex saves, not just damaging Reflex saves.
