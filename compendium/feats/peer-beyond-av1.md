# Peer Beyond  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghost Hunter Dedication](compendium/feats/ghost-hunter-dedication-av1.md)

You have uncanny insight into the way ghosts and haunts manifest, manipulate the mind, and rejuvenate. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effects caused by incorporeal undead and haunts, and you can roll a [Spirit Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) or [Haunt Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check for initiative if you know that an incorporeal undead or a haunt is present.

If you are present when a spirit or haunt is defeated, you instantly gain a flash of insight into how it can be permanently put to rest. Typically, this flash manifests as a vision that presents a quick scene closely linked to the source of the spirit or haunt's creation. Attempt a [Spirit Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) or [Haunt Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check, respectively, with a DC appropriate for the spirit or haunt's level. On a success, you gain a hint about how to put the spirit to rest or permanently disable the haunt; on a critical success, you learn the exact method of doing so.
