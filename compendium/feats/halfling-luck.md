# Halfling Luck  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 1*  
[fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md)  [halfling](rules/traits/halfling.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You fail a skill check or saving throw.
- **Activity** Free Action

Your happy-go-lucky nature makes it seem like misfortune avoids you, and to an extent, that might even be true. You can reroll the triggering check, but you must use the new result, even if it's worse than your first roll.

## Halfling Luck leads to...

[Guiding Luck](compendium/feats/guiding-luck.md), Halfling Ingenuity, Incredible Luck, Shared Luck
