# Executioner Weapon Training  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vigilante Dedication](compendium/feats/vigilante-dedication-apg.md), member of the Gray Gardeners

Your Gray Gardener training has made you deeply skilled with the weapons that execute with a swift chop to the neck. You become trained with the following weapons: battle axe, falchion, greataxe, and scimitar.

Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency with a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency for these weapons.
