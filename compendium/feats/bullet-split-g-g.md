# Bullet Split  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[flourish](rules/traits/flourish.md "Flourish Combat Trait")  [gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You're wielding a firearm or crossbow in one hand and a slashing (or versatile S) melee weapon in the other.
- **Activity** Single Action

You carefully align your weapon with the edge of your blade, splitting the projectile in two as you fire to attack two different targets. Make two [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), one each against two separate targets. The targets must be adjacent to each other and within your weapon's maximum range. Each of these attacks takes a â€“2 penalty to the attack roll, but the two count as only one attack when calculating your multiple attack penalty.
