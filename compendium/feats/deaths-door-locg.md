# Death's Door  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Swordmaster Dedication](compendium/feats/swordmaster-dedication-locg.md)
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Trigger** You take damage that would reduce you to 0 Hit Points.
- **Activity** Reaction

You continue to fight when others would fall. Just before taking the triggering damage, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to twice your level. If you have Hit Points remaining after gaining these temporary Hit Points, you aren't knocked [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), nor do you suffer the other effects of being reduced to 0 Hit Points. Any temporary Hit Points that remain after applying the damage last for up to 4 rounds.
