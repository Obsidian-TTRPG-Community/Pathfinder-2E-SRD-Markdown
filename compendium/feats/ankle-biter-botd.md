# Ankle Biter  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Zombie Dedication](compendium/feats/zombie-dedication-botd.md)

You fight just as well on the ground as you do standing up. While you are [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone), you are always [Taking Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md) against ranged attacks, you ignore the status penalty on your attack rolls from being [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone), and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md). You can choose to move up to half your Speed when you [Crawl](rules/actions/crawl.md). You can instead move up to your full Speed when you [Crawl](rules/actions/crawl.md), but if you do, you must succeed at a DC 6 flat check or your body deteriorates.
