# Nonlethal Takedown  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](compendium/feats/lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md)

You prefer to use nonlethal means against living opponents, but the weapons you carry are lethal enough to destroy undead. You don't take the normal â€“2 circumstance penalty when attacking nonlethally with a weapon that lacks the [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md) trait.
