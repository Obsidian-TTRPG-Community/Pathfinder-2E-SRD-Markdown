# Natural Illusionist  *Feat 5*  
[gnome](rules/traits/gnome.md "Gnome Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Illusion Sense](compendium/feats/illusion-sense.md)

By drawing upon the First World's magic, you can siphon a portion of that malleable world to create a convincing illusion. Once per day, you can cast [illusory disguise](compendium/spells/illusory-disguise.md), [item facade](compendium/spells/item-facade.md), or [ventriloquism](compendium/spells/ventriloquism.md). At 7th level, the spell is heightened to 2nd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened an additional spell level.
