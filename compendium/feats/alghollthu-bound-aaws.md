# Alghollthu Bound  *Feat 1*  
[azarketi](rules/traits/azarketi-loag.md)  


Although you may not even be aware, the alghollthus your ancestors once served maintain a stranglehold on the deepest, tethered parts of your mind. You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to Will saves against [mental](rules/traits/mental.md) effects that would make you [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled), and if you roll a success against such an effect, you get a critical success instead. However, you gain none of these benefits against effects originating from alghollthus and instead take a â€“2 circumstance penalty against [mental](rules/traits/mental.md) effects from alghollthus.
