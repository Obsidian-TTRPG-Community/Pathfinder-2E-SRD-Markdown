# Unwind Death  [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 16*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Clockwork Reanimator Dedication](compendium/feats/clockwork-reanimator-dedication-ooa3.md)
- **Requirements**: The target's body must be mostly intact.
- **Activity** Three-Action

Combining necromancy with the mysterious temporal powers of clockwork, you wind a creature backward from the moment of its death. Attempt a DC 40 [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of raise dead, except it still has the [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition it had before [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying), increased by 1 (or [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) if it wasn't [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) before [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying)). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is then temporarily immune to Unwind Death for 1 day.
