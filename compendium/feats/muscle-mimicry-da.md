# Muscle Mimicry  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 7*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Alter Ego Dedication](compendium/feats/alter-ego-dedication-da.md); trained in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics), master in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception)
- **Trigger** An enemy makes a successful [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md), [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md),
- **Activity** Reaction

[Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md), or [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) attempt.

Your study of another allows you to mirror their movements subtly, even in the heat of combat. You study the successful maneuver of an enemy and instinctively learn to do it. The next time you take the same action they did, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check, or a +2 circumstance bonus if the enemy critically succeeded on their triggering action. You lose this benefit if you don't use it before the end of your next turn.
