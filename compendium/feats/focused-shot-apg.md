# Focused Shot  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Monastic Archer Stance](compendium/feats/monastic-archer-stance-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in [Monastic Archer Stance](compendium/feats/monastic-archer-stance-apg.md).
- **Activity** Single Action

You achieve a state of perfect calm before unleashing your attack, opening your mind to the minute movements of the world around you to increase your accuracy. Make a ranged weapon [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a target within your weapon's first range increment. This [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) ignores the target's [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition and all cover.
