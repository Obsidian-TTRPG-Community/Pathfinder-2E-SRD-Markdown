# Deadly Poison Weapon  *Feat 12*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Improved Poison Weapon](compendium/feats/improved-poison-weapon.md)

Your poisons are devastatingly potent. When you apply a simple poison with [Poison Weapon](compendium/feats/poison-weapon.md), the poison deals `4d4` poison damage instead of `1d4` poison damage. When you apply an injury poison to your weapon, the DC to resist that poison increases by 2, to a maximum of your class DC.
