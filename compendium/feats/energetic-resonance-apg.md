- **Trigger** You would take acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage from a spell.
- **Requirements**: You have an unexpended spell slot of a level equal to or higher than the triggering spell.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your blood resonates with magical energy, mitigating the effects of harmful spells. Expend one of your spell slots of a level equal to or higher than that of the triggering spell. You gain resistance to one of the triggering effect's damage types equal to twice the expended spell slot's level.
