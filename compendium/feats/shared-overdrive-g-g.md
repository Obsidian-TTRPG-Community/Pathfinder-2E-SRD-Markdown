# Shared Overdrive  *Feat 12*  
[inventor](rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md "Inventor Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Overdrive](rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md) Ally

You've experimented enough on your teammates to transfer a substantial number of powered-up gizmos to them, enabling one of your allies to benefit from the full effects and duration of your [Overdrive](rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md). The first time you use [Overdrive](rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md) Ally during a given [Overdrive](rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md), the effect lasts for the remainder of the duration of your [Overdrive](rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md), instead of just until the end of the target's next turn. Any further uses of [Overdrive](rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md) Ally during the same [Overdrive](rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md) have their normal duration, per [Overdrive](rules/actions/overdrive-g-g.md) Ally.
