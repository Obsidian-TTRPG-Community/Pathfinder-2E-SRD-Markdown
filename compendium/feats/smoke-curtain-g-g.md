# Smoke Curtain  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm and are wearing or holding a dose of black powder.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You load an extra dose of powder into your shot, causing it to belch a cloud of smoke. You make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with your firearm and create a cloud of smoke in a 20-foot emanation centered on your location. Creatures are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) while within the smoke, and creatures outside the area are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to creatures within the smoke. The smoke dissipates at the start of your next turn.

If your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) is a critical failure, your firearm misfires.
