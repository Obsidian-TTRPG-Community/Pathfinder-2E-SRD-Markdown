[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Linguist Dedication](compendium/feats/linguist-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** Another creature within 60 feet uses a [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait") effect in a language you understand.
- **Activity** Reaction

You interpret a creature's words, repeating their message in a different language that you know. If the triggering effect's targets speak either the original language or the one you translated into, they are affected.
