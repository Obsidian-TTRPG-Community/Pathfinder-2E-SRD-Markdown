# Loyal Empath  *Feat 5*  
[shoony](rules/traits/shoony-ec3.md)  


You have incredible empathy for your friends and family, and you have an innate timing for helping others in distress.

You can use the [Aid](rules/actions/aid.md) reaction to grant a bonus to another creature's Will saving throw. As usual for [Aid](rules/actions/aid.md), you need to prepare by using an action on your turn to encourage the creature to bravely withstand the effect.
