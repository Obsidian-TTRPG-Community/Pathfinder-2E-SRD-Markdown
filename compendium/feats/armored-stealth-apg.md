# Armored Stealth  *Feat 2*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth)

You have learned techniques to adjust and modify your armor and movements to reduce the noise you make. When you wear non-noisy armor with which you are trained, your penalty to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks is reduced by 1 (to a minimum penalty of 0). If you're a master in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth), reduce the penalty by 2, and if you're legendary, reduce the penalty by 3. If your armor has the [noisy](rules/traits/noisy.md) trait, instead of reducing the penalty to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks, you ignore the effects of the [noisy](rules/traits/noisy.md) trait, enabling you to remove the penalty with a sufficient Strength score as normal.
