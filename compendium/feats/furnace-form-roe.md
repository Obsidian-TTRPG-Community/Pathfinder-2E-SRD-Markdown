- **Activity** Two-Action

Opening your kinetic gate, you allow flames to consume your form and leave you a living flame. You gain the benefits of the [fiery body](compendium/spells/fiery-body.md) spell (except the ability to cast ignition) until the end of your next turn. You can Sustain the impulse up to 1 minute, and when you do, you can [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md) up to half your fly Speed. Your fire Elemental Blasts deal an additional die of damage.
