- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](compendium/feats/lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md), Necromantic Resistance

Through repeated exposure, you've trained to resist the damage wrought by undead. Your resistance to negative damage also applies to damage dealt by the attacks and abilities of undead creatures, regardless of damage type.
