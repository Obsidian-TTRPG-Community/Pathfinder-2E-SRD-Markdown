# Express Driver  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md "Exploration Action & Ability Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Trick Driver Dedication](compendium/feats/trick-driver-dedication-g-g.md)

You can optimize your vehicle's performance, coaxing extra speed and choosing paths to avoid slowdowns.

When calculating your travel speed for the day while piloting a vehicle, you can attempt a [Driving Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check to increase your vehicle's travel speed. The DC is determined by the GM but is typically based on the vehicle's piloting DC or a difficulty based on the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, increase your vehicle's travel speed by half. This has no effect on your vehicle's movement in encounters.
