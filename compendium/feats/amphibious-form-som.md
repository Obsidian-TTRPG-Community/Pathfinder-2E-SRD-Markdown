[evolution](rules/traits/evolution-som.md "Evolution Feat Trait")  [summoner](rules/traits/summoner-som.md "Summoner Class Trait")  


Your eidolon adapts to life on land and underwater. It gains the [amphibious](rules/traits/amphibious-b1.md "Amphibious Creature Trait") trait, allowing it to breathe in water and air and to avoid the normal â€“2 penalty for making bludgeoning and slashing unarmed [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) underwater. It gains a swim Speed equal to its land Speed or 25 feet, whichever is less; or if it is normally aquatic, it gains a land Speed equal to its swim Speed or 25 feet, whichever is less.
