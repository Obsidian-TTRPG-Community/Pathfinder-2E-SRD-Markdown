# Brutish Shove  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  [press](rules/traits/press.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a two-handed melee weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

Throwing your weight behind your attack, you hit your opponent hard enough to make it stumble back. Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a two-handed melee weapon. If you hit a target that is your size or smaller, that creature is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the end of your current turn, and you can automatically [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) it, with the same benefits as the [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) action (including the critical success effect, if your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) was a critical hit). If you move to follow the target, your movement doesn't trigger reactions.

This [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) has the following failure effect.

**Failure** The target becomes [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the end of your current turn.

## Brutish Shove leads to...
