# Invoke The Crimson Oath  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Reclaimant Dedication](compendium/feats/knight-reclaimant-dedication-locg.md)

You can invoke the Crimson Oath to unleash blasts of ruby energy from your weapon. You gain the [invoke the Crimson Oath](compendium/spells/invoke-the-crimson-oath-locg.md) focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) activity to recite the Crimson Oath and meditate on its teachings; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your knight reclaimant focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.
