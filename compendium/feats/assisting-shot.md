# Assisting Shot  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  [press](rules/traits/press.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a ranged weapon
- **Activity** Single Action

With a quick shot, you interfere with a foe in combat. Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a ranged weapon. If the strike hits, the next creature other than you to attack the same target before the start of your next turn gains a +1 circumstance bonus on their roll, or a +2 circumstance bonus if your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) was a critical hit.
