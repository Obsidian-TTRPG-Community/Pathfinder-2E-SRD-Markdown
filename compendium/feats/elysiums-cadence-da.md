# Elysium's Cadence  *Feat 6*  
[aftermath](rules/traits/aftermath-da.md "Aftermath Class Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: You've partied extensively with an azata or entered a romantic relationship with an azata.

You've been ensnared by an azata's infectious enthusiasm for life, love, and freedom that manifests as a pearlescent afterimage in your graceful movements, a spring in your soft steps, an ever-present melody in your euphonic voice, and eddies of passionate colors in your mesmerizing eyes. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md), or a +2 circumstance bonus if the target is chaotic good. You gain the [Set](compendium/setting/deities/set-botd.md) Free reaction.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Set Free** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md))

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger**: You attempt a check to remove or counteract an effect with the [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused), [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled), [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) conditions

**Effect** You roll twice and use the better result.
