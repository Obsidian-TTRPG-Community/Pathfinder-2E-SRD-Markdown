- **Activity** Single Action

You become one with a devastating thunderstorm from the Plane of Air, placing a crown of lightning upon your brow. Sparks flash in your eyes, and lightning strikes constantly in the air around you as howling winds lift you from the ground.

- Any creature that enters your kinetic aura or ends its turn there takes `2d12` electricity damage.
- If you don't have a fly Speed, you gain a 20-foot fly Speed. If you have the Cyclonic Ascent impulse, you instead gain that fly Speed and the extra benefits.
- You gain a +10-foot status bonus to all your Speeds.
- Your air Elemental Blasts deal an additional `1d12` electricity damage.
