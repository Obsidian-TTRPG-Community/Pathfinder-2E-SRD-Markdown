# Stone Form  *Feat 17*  
[oread](rules/traits/oread-b2.md)  


You can transform your body into a pure primal manifestation of earth, an elemental. Once per day, you can cast [elemental form](compendium/spells/elemental-form.md) as a 7th-level primal innate spell, but you can only choose the earth elemental form.
