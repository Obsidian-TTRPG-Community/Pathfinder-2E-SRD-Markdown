- **Activity** Three-Action

You conjure a red raincloud in a 10-foot burst within 60 feet, which pours rust-colored rain directly below it. Any creature in the rain with the metal trait, that is made of metal, or is wearing metal armor is covered in corrosive build-up. Any such creature is [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) as long as it remains in the area. If such a creature is in the rain at the start of its turn, it takes `3d6` damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC, plus `1d6` [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) if it fails. Damage from this impulse ignores Hardness. Level (+2) The initial damage increases by `1d6`.
