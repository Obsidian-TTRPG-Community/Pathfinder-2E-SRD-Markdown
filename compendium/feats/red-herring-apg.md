# Red Herring  *Feat 2*  
[investigator](rules/traits/investigator-apg.md "Investigator Class Trait")  


You have a keen sense for avoiding spurious lines of inquiry. When you [Pursue a Lead](rules/actions/pursue-a-lead-apg.md), the GM tells you if the lead you chose is inconsequential. For example, if you found a splatter of gray mud on the wall, thought it was suspicious, and [Pursued it as a Lead](rules/actions/pursue-a-lead-apg.md), the GM would tell you if there was no greater mystery related to it. When the GM tells you a lead is inconsequential, you can decline to [Pursue the Lead](rules/actions/pursue-a-lead-apg.md), keeping any leads you were already pursuing. You still can't use [Pursue a Lead](rules/actions/pursue-a-lead-apg.md) again for 10 minutes, as normal.
