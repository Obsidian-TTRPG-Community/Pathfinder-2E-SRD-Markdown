# Aggressive Block  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 2*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** You use the [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) reaction, and the opponent that triggered [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) is adjacent to you and is your size or smaller.
- **Activity** Free Action

You push back as you block the attack, knocking your foe away or off balance. You use your shield to push the triggering creature, either automatically [Shoving](rules/actions/shove.md) it 5 feet or causing it to become [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of your next turn. The triggering creature chooses whether to be moved or become [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed). If it chooses to be moved, you choose the direction. If the [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) would cause it to hit a solid object, enter a square of difficult terrain, or enter another creature's space, it must become [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) instead of being moved.

## Aggressive Block leads to...

[Flinging Shove](compendium/feats/flinging-shove.md), [Powerful Shove](compendium/feats/powerful-shove.md)
