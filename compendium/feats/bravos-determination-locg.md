# Bravo's Determination  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Firebrand Braggart Dedication](compendium/feats/firebrand-braggart-dedication-locg.md)
- **Trigger** A foe's [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) reduces you to 0 Hit Points; you were not at 1 Hit Point and you would not be killed.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your confidence borders on self-delusion, but it keeps you going against overwhelming odds. Attempt a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check against the attack DC of the triggering [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). You take a penalty to this check equal to twice your [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) value, if any. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, use the result one degree of success worse than what you rolled.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point.
> - **Success** You avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point, but you increase your [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) value by 1.
