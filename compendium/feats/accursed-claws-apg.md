# Accursed Claws  *Feat 9*  
[changeling](rules/traits/changeling-b1.md "Changeling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: claw unarmed attack

Your claws carry your mother's hag magic. When you critically hit with a claw [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), the target takes an additional `1d4` [persistent mental damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
