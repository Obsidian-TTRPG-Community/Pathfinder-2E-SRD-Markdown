# Follow-up Assault  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You used your previous action to make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that missed.
- **Activity** Single Action

Even in the face of failure you press the attack, determined to succeed. Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the same weapon, adding the effects of the [backswing](rules/traits/backswing.md "Backswing Weapon Trait") and [forceful](rules/traits/forceful.md "Forceful Weapon Trait") weapon traits.
