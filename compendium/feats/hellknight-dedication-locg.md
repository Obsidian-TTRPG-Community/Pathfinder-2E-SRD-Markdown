# Hellknight Dedication  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hellknight Armiger Dedication](compendium/feats/hellknight-armiger-dedication-lowg.md), lawful alignment, member of a Hellknight order, passed the Hellknight Test

You have forged your body to comply with the commands of your mindâ€”orders steeped in the Measure and the Chain. You gain expert proficiency in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) (or in another skill in which you're trained of your choice, if you were already an expert in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation)). You gain the armor specialization effects of Hellknight plate, and your resistance from that armor specialization is 1 higher than normal. In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks while wearing your Hellknight plate.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Hellknight or Hellknight armiger archetypes.

## Hellknight Dedication leads to...

[Advanced Order Training](compendium/feats/advanced-order-training-locg.md), [Blade Of Law](compendium/feats/blade-of-law-locg.md), [Hell's Armaments](compendium/feats/hells-armaments-locg.md), [Hellknight Order Cross-training](compendium/feats/hellknight-order-cross-training-locg.md), [Sense Chaos](compendium/feats/sense-chaos-locg.md)
