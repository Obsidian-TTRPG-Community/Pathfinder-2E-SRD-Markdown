# Aura Shaping  *Feat 10*  
[kineticist](rules/traits/kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  


You control the size of your kinetic aura. You can make your kinetic aura's emanation any size from a 5-foot emanation to a 20-foot emanation (you must choose a multiple of 5). You choose the size when you [Channel Elements](rules/actions/channel-elements-roe.md) and can change it when you use a stance impulse that affects your kinetic aura.

Increase the maximum size you can choose by 5 feet at 15th and 20th levels.
