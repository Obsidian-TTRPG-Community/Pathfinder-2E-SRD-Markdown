# Healing Bomb  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 4*  
[additive <2>](rules/traits/additive.md)  [alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Trigger** You craft an elixir of life using [Quick Alchemy](rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md), and that elixir is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.
- **Activity** Free Action

By adding a special catalyst, you transform a healing elixir into a topical projectile. You grant the elixir the [bomb](rules/traits/bomb.md) trait.

If you throw an elixir of life bomb at a willing target, you hit even on a failure, though not on a critical failure. If your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with this elixir bomb hits a living target, the target regains Hit Points as if it had consumed the elixir. On a critical success, the target also gains the elixir's item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 1 minute.
