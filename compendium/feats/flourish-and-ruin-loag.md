# Flourish And Ruin  *Feat 17*  
[leshy](rules/traits/leshy-b1.md "Leshy Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You can call upon the vital essence of your spirit to restore life to your allies and call forth vines to ensnare and bludgeon your foes.

You can cast [field of life](compendium/spells/field-of-life.md) and [tangling creepers](compendium/spells/tangling-creepers.md) as 6th-level primal innate spells once per day each. You become an expert in primal spell attack rolls and primal spell DCs.
