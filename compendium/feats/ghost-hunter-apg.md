# Ghost Hunter  *Feat 1*  
[duskwalker](rules/traits/duskwalker-apg.md)  


Your connection to the Boneyard ensures that your blows strike true against spectral beings. Your weapon and unarmed attack [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) against incorporeal creatures become magical. If they are already magical, they instead gain the effects of a [ghost touch](compendium/equipment/items/ghost-touch.md) property rune.
