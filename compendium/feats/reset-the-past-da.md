# Reset the Past  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Free Action

You manipulate time to recharge one of your temporal techniquesâ€”by revising your past so you never used it in the first place. Select one of your chronoskimmer feats that has a frequency of once per day (or more frequent) that you've already used. You can use the feat again, as if you hadn't used it already.
