# Irrepressible  *Feat 9*  
[halfling](rules/traits/halfling.md)  


You are easily able to ward off attempts to play on your fears and emotions. When you roll a success on a saving throw against an [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md) effect, you get a critical success instead. If your heritage is gutsy halfling, when you roll a critical failure on a saving throw against an [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md) effect, you get a failure instead.
