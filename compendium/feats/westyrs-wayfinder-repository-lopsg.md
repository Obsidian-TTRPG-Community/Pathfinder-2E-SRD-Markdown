# Westyr's Wayfinder Repository  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](compendium/feats/pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md), Wayfinder
- **Requirements**: You have at least one 1st-level spell slot and a wayfinder.

You can use your wayfinder to store a little extra magic for when you need it most. When making your daily preparations, you can choose one 1st-level spell from your spellbook or spell repertoire and store it in your wayfinder. You can cast this spell from the wayfinder using the normal actions required. Once the spell has been cast, it is expended, and you must make your next daily preparations to store another spell in your wayfinder.
