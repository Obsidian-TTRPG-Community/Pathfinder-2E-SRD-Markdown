# Scout's Charge  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [flourish](rules/traits/flourish.md "Flourish Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Scout Dedication](compendium/feats/scout-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You meander around unpredictably, and then ambush your opponents without warning. Choose one enemy. [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), [Feint](rules/actions/feint.md) against that opponent, and then make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against that foe. For your [Feint](rules/actions/feint.md), you can attempt a [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check instead of the [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check that's usually required, because you use the terrain around you to catch your foe off-guard.
