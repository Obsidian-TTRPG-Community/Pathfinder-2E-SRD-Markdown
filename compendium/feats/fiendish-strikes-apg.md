# Fiendish Strikes  *Feat 13*  
[tiefling](rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md "Tiefling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your festering connection to the forces of evil infuses your weapons with debilitating malevolence, tearing down creatures of good with every attack. All your weapon and unarmed [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) deal 1 additional evil damage and have the [evil](rules/traits/evil.md "Evil Alignment Trait") and [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") traits.
