# Directed Audience  *Feat 2*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  


You can shape the area of your composition spells. Whenever you cast a composition spell whose area is an emanation, you can change the spell's area to a cone 10 feet larger, to a maximum of twice the original area. For example, you could modify a composition spell that affects a 30-foot emanation to affect a 40-foot cone, but a 5-foot emanation could only become a 10-foot cone.
