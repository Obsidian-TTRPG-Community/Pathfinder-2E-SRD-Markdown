- **Prerequisites**: [Mauler Dedication](compendium/feats/mauler-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a melee weapon in two hands.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You put your body behind your massive weapon and swing, shoving enemies to clear a wide path. You attempt to [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) up to five creatures adjacent to you, rolling a separate [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check for each target. Then [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) up to half your Speed. This movement doesn't trigger reactions from any of the creatures you successfully Shoved.
