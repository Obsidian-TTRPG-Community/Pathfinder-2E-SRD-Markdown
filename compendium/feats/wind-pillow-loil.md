# Wind Pillow  *Feat 1*  
[sylph](rules/traits/sylph-b2.md)  


The winds have whispered to you all your life, and the essence of air itself helps you at times, making you somewhat buoyant when you're suspended in space. Treat all falls as though they were 10 feet less than the actual distance traveled. You also gain the [Powerful Leap](compendium/feats/powerful-leap.md) skill feat, even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites.
