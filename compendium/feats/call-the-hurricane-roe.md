- **Activity** Two-Action

Massive waves spiral around you, with you as the eye of the hurricane. The waves appear in a 20-foot emanation, or a 30-foot emanation if you're in a body of water. Each creature in the area takes `6d8` bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. A creature that fails its save is battered by the waves and pushed 10 feet (or 20 feet on a critical failure). Level (+2) The damage increases by `1d8`.
