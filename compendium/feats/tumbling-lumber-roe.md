# Tumbling Lumber  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[impulse](rules/traits/impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](rules/traits/kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  wood  

- **Activity** Two-Action

A slew of logs eject from the Plane of Wood and slam into your enemies. They roll in a 10-foot-wide, 30-foot-long line. Non-magical difficult terrain on any ground the logs roll over is smashed flat; greater difficult terrain remains. Each creature in the area takes `2d8` bludgeoning damage and might be moved by the logs, depending on its Reflex save against your class DC.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is pushed out of the line in the most direct path available.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone). Level (+3) The damage increases by `1d8`.
