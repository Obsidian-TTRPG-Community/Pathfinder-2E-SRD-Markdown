# Titan's Stature  *Feat 12*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [instinct](rules/traits/instinct.md)  [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md)  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Giant instinct, [Giant's Stature](compendium/feats/giants-stature.md)

You grow to even greater size. When using Giant's Stature, you can instead become Huge (increasing your reach by 10 feet if you were Medium or smaller) while you are raging. You have the [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) condition as long as you are Huge.
