# Reverberate  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 12*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** You would take sonic damage from a spell.
- **Activity** Reaction

You can manipulate the acoustics around you to deflect sonic damage back at its source. Attempt a [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check against the spell DC of the creature that cast the triggering spell.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You reduce the triggering damage by an amount up to four times your level. The caster takes sonic damage equal to the amount of damage you reduced in this way.
> - **Success** As critical success, but you reduce the triggering damage by an amount up to twice your level.
> - **Critical Failure** You misdirect the sonic waves at yourself, taking twice the triggering damage.
