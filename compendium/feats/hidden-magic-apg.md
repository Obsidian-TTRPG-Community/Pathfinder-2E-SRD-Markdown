# Hidden Magic  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion); [Vigilante Dedication](compendium/feats/vigilante-dedication-apg.md)

You've learned to hide the magical auras of your gear. During your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your magic items to appear non-magical. Objects adjusted in this way remain so until your next preparations.

A spellcaster using [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) or [read aura](compendium/spells/read-aura.md) must succeed at a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check against your [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) DC to see through your obfuscations.
