# Bone Rider  *Feat 17*  
[lizardfolk](rules/traits/lizardfolk-b1.md)  


Using your ancestors' bones, you manifest their spirits around you in a fossilized form, terrifying your foes. You can cast [mask of terror](compendium/spells/mask-of-terror.md) on yourself as a primal innate spell once per day. When you do, you appear as a skeletal lizardfolk ancestor, twisted in a way that inspires the deepest fears of those who observe you.
