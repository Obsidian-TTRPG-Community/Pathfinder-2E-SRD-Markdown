[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  


You move as fast and as high as the wind itself. You're permanently [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened). You can use your extra action to [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) or [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md), or to provide one of the actions needed for a [High Jump](rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](rules/actions/long-jump.md).
