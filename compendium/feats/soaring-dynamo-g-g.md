# Soaring Dynamo  *Feat 18*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sterling Dynamo Dedication](compendium/feats/sterling-dynamo-dedication-g-g.md)

You've built clockwork wings or jets into your dynamo, allowing you to use your prosthesis to fly. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. Each minute of flight reduces the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour, measured from the first time you use the [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md) action in a given minute.
