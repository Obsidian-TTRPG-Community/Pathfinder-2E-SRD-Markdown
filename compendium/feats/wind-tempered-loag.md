# Wind Tempered  *Feat 1*  
[sylph](rules/traits/sylph-b2.md)  


You are at home in tempestuous weather and accustomed to even the harshest winds. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against [air](rules/traits/air.md) and [electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md) effects.

If you roll a success on a save against an [air](rules/traits/air.md) effect, you get a critical success instead.
