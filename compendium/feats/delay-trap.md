# Delay Trap  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Trigger** A trap within your reach is triggered.
- **Activity** Reaction

You can jam the workings of a trap to delay its effects. Attempt a [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check to [Disable a Device](rules/actions/disable-a-device.md) on the trap; the DC to do so is increased by 5, and the effects are as follows.
