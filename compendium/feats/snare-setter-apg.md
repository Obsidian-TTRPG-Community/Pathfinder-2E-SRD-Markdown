[kobold](rules/traits/kobold-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

You are adept at the time-honored kobold art of trap making. You gain the trained proficiency in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting). If you were already trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain access to all uncommon kobold snares. You gain the [Snare Crafting](compendium/feats/snare-crafting.md) feat, though when choosing your formulas for that feat, you can also choose from uncommon kobold snares, as well as common snares.
