# Warren Navigator  *Feat 1*  
[ratfolk](rules/traits/ratfolk-b1.md "Ratfolk Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You're particularly good at solving mazes and navigating twists and turns. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival).

If you would automatically become trained in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) (from your background or class, for example), you become trained in another skill of your choice. When you [Sense Direction](rules/actions/sense-direction.md) or attempt a roll against a [maze](compendium/spells/maze.md) spell, you get a result one degree of success better than you rolled. You don't take a penalty to [Sense Direction](rules/actions/sense-direction.md) when you lack a compass.
