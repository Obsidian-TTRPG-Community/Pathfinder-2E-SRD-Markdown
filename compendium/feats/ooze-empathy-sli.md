# Ooze Empathy  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Oozemorph Dedication](compendium/feats/oozemorph-dedication-sli.md), at least two other class feats from the oozemorph archetype

You can connect with oozes (and other amorphous aberrations, at the GM's discretion) on a rudimentary level. You can use [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on oozes and to make very simple Requests of them. In most instances, oozes will give you time to make your case.
