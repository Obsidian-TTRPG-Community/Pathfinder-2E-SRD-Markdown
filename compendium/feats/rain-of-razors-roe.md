[impulse](rules/traits/impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](rules/traits/kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [overflow](rules/traits/overflow-roe.md "Overflow Action & Ability Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  metal  

- **Activity** Three-Action

Razor-sharp slivers of metal fall from the sky. Each creature in a 20-foot burst within 60 feet takes `9d6` slashing damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The razors embed in all surfaces in the area, making them hazardous terrain for 1 minute. A creature that moves through this hazardous terrain takes 3 slashing damage for every square of the area it moves into.

Level (+2) The initial damage increases by `1d6` and the hazardous terrain damage increases by 1.
