# Firework Technician Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

You've learned the secrets of making fire and sound bloom using black powder, metals, and paper. You most likely came by this knowledge through formal training with a fireworks house in Tian Xia or a fireworks company from Vudra, though perhaps you mastered fireworks completely by yourself after finding a secret stash in an old shipwreck.

You become trained in [Fireworks Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) or become an expert if you were already trained in it. You gain the [Alchemical Crafting](compendium/feats/alchemical-crafting.md) feat, a pool of infused reagents equal to your level, and advanced alchemy|alchemist||1| (allowing you to make alchemical items during your daily preparations without the normal cost or time expenditure). You can use your infused reagents only to make fireworks, Launch a Fireworks Display, and use other feats from this archetype (see below). Your advanced alchemy level is 1. If you gain infused reagents from more than one source, you use the highest number of reagents to determine your pool rather than adding them together.

You can also create special fireworks displays using your infused reagents, designed to create distinctive effects you can use to make onlookers marvel and even to gain an advantage in combat. You gain the Launch Fireworks Display action and learn some basic displays, and you can learn additional, more complex displays through other firework technician feats. The DC for any display is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

title: **Launch Fireworks Display** [V](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Varies") Varies ([>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") to [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") (see below)) ([manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md))
- **Cost**: 1 or more batches of infused reagents
- **Requirements**: You have a free hand

**Effect** You set off a fireworks display. You can launch a normal firework to simply create a visual or audible signal within 20 feet or you can choose one of the following special effects. A firework display has the listed traits, and if it costs more than 1 batch of infused reagents, it is noted in its Cost entry.

- **Comet** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") ([visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")) You shoot a streak of shining light in a 60-foot line. All spaces in that line are lit with bright light until the start of your next turn. As part of this action, you can also [Point Out](rules/actions/point-out.md) a single creature in the line, and your allies do not need to hear or understand you.
- **Flower** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") ([visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")) You ignite a ring of sparks, creating a shape that might be reminiscent of a flower blooming in the sky. Each enemy with 20 feet of you must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, the enemy is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round, and on a critical failure they are [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 2 rounds.
- **Salute** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") ([auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")) You create a startling bang or whistle, adding an [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") component to your fireworks display. When you launch a salute display, you can choose a [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused) or [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) ally within 60 feet. If the ally you chose is [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), the noise is so violent that it acts as a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) effect for the purpose of their [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) condition (though it has no negative repercussions) automatically ending most applications of the [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) condition. If they're [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused), the sound is so loud and violent that it might snap the ally out of confusion. They can immediately attempt the flat check to remove the [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused) condition which normally occurs when a creature is damaged. If the [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused) condition has special rules that remove the flat check when taking damage or make the flat check harder, those rules also apply to the salute.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the fireworks technician archetype.
