# Triangle Shot  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 18*  
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [flourish](rules/traits/flourish.md)  [monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Monastic Archer Stance](compendium/feats/monastic-archer-stance-apg.md), [Stunning Fist](compendium/feats/stunning-fist.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in Monastic Archer Stance and wielding a bow usable with that stance.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You string three arrows to your bow and fire them all at once. Make three ranged [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) against a single target with the required weapon, each using your current multiple attack penalty, and you take an additional â€“2 penalty. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty, and you combine the attacks' damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Your Stunning Fist benefit applies to Triangle Shot, even though it isn't a [Flurry of Blows](rules/actions/flurry-of-blows.md). If all three [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) hit, the target takes `3d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
