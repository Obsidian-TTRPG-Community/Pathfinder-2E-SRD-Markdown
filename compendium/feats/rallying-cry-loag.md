- **Frequency**: once per day

You call out to your allies and push them to give their all in combat. All allies within 30 feet that can hear you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level. In addition, these allies become [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) for 1 minute but can only use the extra action to [Step](rules/actions/step.md), [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), or [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
