# Shining Arms  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](compendium/feats/spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [light](compendium/spells/light.md)

When you cast [light](compendium/spells/light.md), you can modify its target to be 1 melee weapon, either unattended or possessed by you or a willing ally, and modify its duration to be 1 minute. If you do, add the following to its effects: When a creature wielding the weapon critically hits a foe, you can [Dismiss the Spell](rules/actions/dismiss.md) as a reaction, causing the foe to be [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round. After you use this reaction, you can't use this modification again for 10 minutes.
