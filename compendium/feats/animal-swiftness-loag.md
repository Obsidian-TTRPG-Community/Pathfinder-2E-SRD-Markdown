# Animal Swiftness  *Feat 17*  
[beastkin](rules/traits/beastkin-loag.md "Beastkin Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You move like an animal. Your Speed increases by 5 feet. In addition, you gain one of the following Speeds available to your inherent animal: climb, fly, or swim. You gain this Speed only while in your hybrid shape.

The new movement is as fast as your standard Speed; for example, if you have a 30-foot Speed, you can gain a 30-foot climb Speed. If your inherent animal doesn't typically have a specific type of Speed, you can't gain it with this feat. If your inherent animal doesn't typically have a climb, fly, or swim Speed, your Speed increases by 10 feet instead.
