# Furious Focus  *Feat 6*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Power Attack](compendium/feats/power-attack.md)

You've learned to maintain your balance even when swinging furiously. When you make a Power Attack with a melee weapon you're wielding in two hands, it counts as one attack toward your multiple attack penalty instead of two.
