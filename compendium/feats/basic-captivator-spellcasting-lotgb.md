# Basic Captivator Spellcasting  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Captivator Dedication](compendium/feats/captivator-dedication-lotgb.md)

Your innate ability to fascinate others develops into full-fledged spellcasting. This spellcasting comes naturally and instinctively to you, rather than as a product of training.

Choose a 1st-level occult spell from either the enchantment or illusion school. You can [Cast this Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) as an occult innate spell. At 6th level, you gain a 2nd-level spell, and at 8th level, you gain a 3rd-level spell. Each of these spells must be from either the enchantment or illusion school.

## Basic Captivator Spellcasting leads to...

[Captivating Intensity](compendium/feats/captivating-intensity-lotgb.md), [Countercharm](compendium/feats/countercharm-lotgb.md), [Expert Captivator Spellcasting](compendium/feats/expert-captivator-spellcasting-lotgb.md), [Master Captivator Spellcasting](compendium/feats/master-captivator-spellcasting-lotgb.md)
