# Experienced Smuggler  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth)

You often smuggle things past the authorities. When the GM rolls your [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check to see if a passive observer notices a small item you have concealed, the GM uses the number rolled or 10—whichever is higher—as the result of your die roll, adding it to your [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) modifier to determine your [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check result. If you're a master in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth), the GM uses the number rolled or 15, and if you're legendary in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth), you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item from passive observers. This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check while actively searching you for hidden items. Due to your smuggling skill, you're more likely to find more lucrative smuggling jobs when using [Underworld Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) to [Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md).
