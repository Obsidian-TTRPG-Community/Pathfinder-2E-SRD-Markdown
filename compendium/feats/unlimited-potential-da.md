[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  [psychic](rules/traits/psychic-da.md "Psychic Class Trait")

- **Activity** Single Action
