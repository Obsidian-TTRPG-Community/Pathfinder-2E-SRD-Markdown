# Cremate Undead  *Feat 8*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  


Your positive energy sets undead alight. When you use a [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) spell to damage undead, each undead that takes damage also takes [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to the spell's level.
