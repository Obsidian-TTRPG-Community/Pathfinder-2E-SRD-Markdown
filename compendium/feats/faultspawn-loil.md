# Faultspawn  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  [tiefling](rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md "Tiefling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You bear a grudge, inherited from a blasphemous asura forebear in your bloodline, against a particular deity and their works. You also have some vestigial signs of your previous incarnation, such as a second set of shoulder blades without usable arms, a set of mostly closed eyes where no eyes belong, or strange scarring reminiscent of a mouth. You gain the Find Fault reaction.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Find Fault** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md))

- **Trigger**: You attempt a saving throw against a spell or magic effect but haven't rolled yet

**Effect** You find some kind of fault with the magic, using that flaw to protect yourself from the effect. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your saving throw against the triggering effect, which increases to a +2 circumstance bonus if the effect is [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait") and originates from a worshipper of the deity you chose for your grudge.
