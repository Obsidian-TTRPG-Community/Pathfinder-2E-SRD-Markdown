# Butterfly Blade Dedication  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: Defeat a member of the Butterfly Blades in a sanctioned bout.
- **Prerequisites**: trained in butterfly swords

You become trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) and [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. Whenever your proficiency rank in any weapon increases to expert or beyond, you also gain that new proficiency rank with butterfly swords. You gain access to butterfly swords.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from this archetype.
