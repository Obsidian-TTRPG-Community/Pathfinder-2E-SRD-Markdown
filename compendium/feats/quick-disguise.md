# Quick Disguise  *Feat 2*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception)

You can set up a disguise in half the usual time (generally 5 minutes). If you're a master, it takes one-tenth the usual time (usually 1 minute). If you're legendary, you can create a full disguise and [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) as a 3-action activity.
