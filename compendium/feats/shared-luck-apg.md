# Shared Luck  *Feat 9*  
[catfolk](rules/traits/catfolk-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cat's Luck](compendium/feats/cats-luck-apg.md)

When you use [Cat's Luck](compendium/feats/cats-luck-apg.md) to reroll a Reflex saving throw, any creatures you choose within 10 feet who also just failed a Reflex saving throw against the same effect (such as a single spell) can also reroll their saving throws and use the better result.
