# Tactical Cadence  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cadence Call](compendium/feats/cadence-call-apg.md)

Your remarkable breath control and concise instructions allow you to coordinate your allies more effectively. When you grant allies the [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) condition using Cadence Call, they can use the extra action to either [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) or [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), and they aren't [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) on their following turn if they use the extra action.
