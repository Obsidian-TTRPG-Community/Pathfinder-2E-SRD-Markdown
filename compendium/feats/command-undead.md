# Command Undead  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: harmful font, evil alignment
- **Activity** Single Action

You grasp the animating force within an undead creature and bend it to your will. If the next action you use is to cast [harm](compendium/spells/harm.md) targeting one undead creature, you transform the effects of that [harm](compendium/spells/harm.md) spell. Instead of harm's normal effects, the target becomes [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by you if its level is equal to or lower than your level â€“ 3. It can attempt a Will saving throw to resist being [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by you. If the target is already under someone else's command, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw, and the undead uses the better result.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The undead creature becomes a [minion](rules/traits/minion.md "Minion Creature Trait") under your control. The spell gains a duration of 1 minute, but it is dismissed if you or an ally attacks the minion undead.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.
