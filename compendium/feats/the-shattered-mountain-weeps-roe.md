- **Activity** Three-Action

A massive sphere of rock explodes, unleashing a cataclysm of falling debris and deadly shrapnel. Its destruction falls in a 20-foot burst within 120 feet. Creatures in the area take `9d10` bludgeoning damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC. Those who fail are knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone). For the next minute, rocks continue to fall, making the area difficult terrain and dealing `3d10` bludgeoning damage to any creature that ends its turn in the area. If you use this impulse again, any previous one ends.
