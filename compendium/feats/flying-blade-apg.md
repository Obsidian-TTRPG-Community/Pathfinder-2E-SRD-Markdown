# Flying Blade  *Feat 1*  
[swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md "Swashbuckler Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: precise strike

You've learned to apply your flashy techniques to thrown weapons as easily as melee attacks. When you have panache, you apply your precise strike damage on ranged [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) you make with a [thrown](rules/traits/thrown.md "Thrown Weapon Trait") weapon within that weapon's first range increment. The thrown weapon must be an [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait") or [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait") weapon. This also allows you to make a thrown weapon ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) for [Confident Finisher](rules/actions/confident-finisher-apg.md) and any other finisher that includes a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that can benefit from your precise strike.
