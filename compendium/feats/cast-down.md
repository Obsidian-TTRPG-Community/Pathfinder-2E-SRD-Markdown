# Cast Down  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: harmful font or healing font
- **Activity** Single Action

The sheer force of your faith can bring a foe crashing down. If the next action you use is to cast [harm](compendium/spells/harm.md) or heal to damage one creature, the target is knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) if it takes any damage from the spell. If the target critically fails its save against the spell, it also takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speed for 1 minute.
