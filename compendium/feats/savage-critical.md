# Savage Critical  *Feat 18*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  


The wounds you inflict are grievous. When you [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a weapon or unarmed attack for which you have legendary proficiency, you critically succeed if you roll a 19 on the die as long as that result is a success. This has no effect on a 19 if the result would be a failure.
