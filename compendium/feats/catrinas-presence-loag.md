# Catrina's Presence  *Feat 9*  
[duskwalker](rules/traits/duskwalker-apg.md)  


You've adopted the calming presence of catrinas, the festive dead; you might have even danced with a catrina yourself! So long as you are visibly carrying fresh flowers or colorful ribbons somewhere on your person, you can cast [calm emotions](compendium/spells/calm-emotions.md) twice per day as a 2nd-level divine innate spell.
