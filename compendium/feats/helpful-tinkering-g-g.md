# Helpful Tinkering  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[inventor](rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md "Inventor Class Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: offensive boost|inventor|G&G|9|offensive boosts
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Activity** Single Action

You don't just tinker with your own innovation, you fiddle with your allies' weapons as well (for their benefit, of course). Choose an ally in your reach and one of their weapons. Attempt a [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check against a high DC for your level.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** For 1 minute, the chosen ally's [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) with the chosen weapon gain the same offensive boost|inventor|G&G|9|offensive boosts your innovation has.
> - **Critical Failure** Your ally takes damage of the type and amount that your offensive boost|inventor|G&G|9|offensive boosts normally deals on a successful [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
