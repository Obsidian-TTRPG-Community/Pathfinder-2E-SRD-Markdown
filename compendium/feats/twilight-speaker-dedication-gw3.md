# Twilight Speaker Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society), you are an Ilverani elf

You have carefully studied the histories, customs, and etiquette of many of the younger peoples of Golarion. You become an expert in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society). At 7th level, you become a master in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society), and at 15th level, you become legendary in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society). You can use the [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) skill instead of the [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) skill when you attempt to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on a non-elven intelligent humanoid creature.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the twilight speaker archetype.
