# Forager  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival)

While using [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) to [Subsist](rules/actions/subsist.md), if you roll any result worse than a success, you get a success. On a success, you can provide subsistence living for yourself and four additional creatures, and on a critical success, you can take care of twice as many creatures as on a success.

Each time your proficiency rank in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) increases, double the number of additional creatures you can take care of on a success (to eight if you're an expert, 16 if you're a master, or 32 if you're legendary). You can choose to care for half the number of additional creatures and provide a comfortable living instead of subsistence living.

Multiple smaller creatures or creatures with significantly smaller appetites than a human are counted as a single creature for this feat, and larger creatures or those with significantly greater appetites each count as multiple creatures. The GM determines how much a non-human creature needs to eat.
