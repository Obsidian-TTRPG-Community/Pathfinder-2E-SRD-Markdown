# Reflective Defense  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait")  talos  

- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Trigger** A creature within 30 feet of you targets you, and you can see the attacker.
- **Requirements**: You are in dim or bright light.
- **Activity** Reaction
