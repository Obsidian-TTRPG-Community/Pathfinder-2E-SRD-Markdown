# Eclectic Obsession  *Feat 5*  
[gnome](rules/traits/gnome.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Gnome Obsession](compendium/feats/gnome-obsession.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day

Your desire for stimulation has led you from one pursuit to another and granted you a smattering of expertise with myriad crafts and professions. You reflect on snippets you've learned to temporarily become trained in one [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill of your choice. This proficiency lasts for 10 minutes or until you critically fail a check with that skill. Since this training is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for a permanent character option like a feat or a skill increase.
