# Close Quarters  *Feat 9*  
[kobold](rules/traits/kobold-b1.md "Kobold Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You've trained to fight with allies in tunnel warrens, dense undergrowth, or similarly cramped terrain. If you are Small or smaller, you can end your movement in the same square as a Small or smaller ally. No more than two creatures can share the same space when using this ability or a similar one.
