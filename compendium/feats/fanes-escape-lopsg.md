# Fane's Escape  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth)
- **Requirements**: You have a deck of playing cards in your possession.
- **Activity** Two-Action

A good getaway requires a good distraction. You [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to draw a deck of cards and flip it in a fluttering explosion, causing you to become briefly [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) to all other creatures using vision as their precise sense, and then you [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md). You have enough cover to [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md) until the end of your turn. This leaves all of the cards from the deck scattered about the room; collecting them into a deck again takes several minutes.
