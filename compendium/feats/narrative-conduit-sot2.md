# Narrative Conduit  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Folklorist Dedication](compendium/feats/folklorist-dedication-sot2.md)

You act as a conduit for your companions just as your stories are a conduit between teller and listener. When you Spin a Tale and the hero of your tale Casts a Spell against the villain, you warp the world, allowing the hero to calculate range and cover to the villain from your space instead of their own if they prefer. The hero must choose to calculate both range and cover from the same space; they can't use one space for range and the other for cover.
