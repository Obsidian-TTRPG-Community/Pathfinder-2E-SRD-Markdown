# Eternal Boost  *Feat 20*  
[summoner](rules/traits/summoner-som.md "Summoner Class Trait")  


Your link with your eidolon is so intense that you continuously reinforce its abilities. You are permanently [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened); you can use your extra action only to cast [boost eidolon](compendium/spells/boost-eidolon-som.md) or [reinforce eidolon](compendium/spells/reinforce-eidolon-som.md). While in exploration mode, you can declare that you are also continually casting [boost eidolon](compendium/spells/boost-eidolon-som.md) or [reinforce eidolon](compendium/spells/reinforce-eidolon-som.md) even while using a different exploration activity. If you do, even before your first turn in a combat encounter, that cantrip is active as if you had cast it on your previous turn.
