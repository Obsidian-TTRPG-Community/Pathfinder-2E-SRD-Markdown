# Eagle Eyes  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sniping Duo Dedication](compendium/feats/sniping-duo-dedication-g-g.md)

You and your spotter are adept at watching out for one another. As long as you can see or hear each other, neither of you is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden), [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected), or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or to creatures of your level or lower using a surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.
