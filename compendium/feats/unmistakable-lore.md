# Unmistakable Lore  *Feat 2*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore)

You never get information about your areas of expertise wrong.

When you [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) using any [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) subcategory in which you're trained, if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. If you're a master in a [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) subcategory, on a critical success, you gain even more information or context than usual.
