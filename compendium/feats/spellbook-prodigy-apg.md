# Spellbook Prodigy  *Feat 1*  
[wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md "Wizard Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana)

You are particularly adept at learning spells to add to your spellbook. You can [Learn a Spell](rules/actions/learn-a-spell.md) in half the time it normally takes. Further, when you roll a critical failure on your check to [Learn a Spell](rules/actions/learn-a-spell.md), you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure, you can try again after 1 week.
