[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: You speak at least three languages.

You have studied languages and their development. You become trained in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society); if you were already trained in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society), you instead become an expert in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society). You gain the [Multilingual](compendium/feats/multilingual.md) skill feat twice.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the linguist archetype.
