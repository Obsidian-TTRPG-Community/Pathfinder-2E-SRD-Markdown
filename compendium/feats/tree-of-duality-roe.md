- **Activity** Three-Action

An ephemeral tree bursts forth, floating on air in an unoccupied square of your choice within 60 feet. Blooming flowers and fungal growths shed pollen and spores, which a swirling gust of air spreads in a 10-foot emanation around it. The tree lasts until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain it up to 1 minute.

- Cleansing Pollen (healing, vitality) Each living ally that's in the area or enters it regains `3d4` HP and is then temporarily immune to regaining HP from Tree of Duality for 10 minutes.
- Hallucinogenic Spores (mental) Enemies in the area are [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled). An enemy that leaves the area remains [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until the start of its next turn. Level (+2) The healing increases by `1d4`.
