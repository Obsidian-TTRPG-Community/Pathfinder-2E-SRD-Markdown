- **Activity** Single Action

Clouds, like eager pets, are drawn to you and to those in your good graces. Fast-moving gray clouds surround you, as well as your allies while they're in your kinetic aura. Anyone surrounded by these clouds gains a +2 status bonus to Reflex saves and [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) checks. When an affected creature uses a move action, clouds dance around it. Until the start of its next turn, it's [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed), and its Strikes gain the shock rune.
