# Plague Sniffer  *Feat 5*  
[ratfolk](rules/traits/ratfolk-b1.md "Ratfolk Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: longsnout rat heritage

You can sniff out the pungent tang of disease. When you detect a creature by [scent](rules/abilities/scent.md), you can also detect if that creature is suffering from a disease at a non-carrier state. If the disease is particularly subtle, you might need to attempt a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check against the disease's DC (subject to the GM's discretion).
