Your affinity with process and order makes you a natural artisan. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) (or another skill of your choice, if you're already trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)). You gain the [Specialty Crafting](compendium/feats/specialty-crafting.md) skill feat in a specialty of your choice.
