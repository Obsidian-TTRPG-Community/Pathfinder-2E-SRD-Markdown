[monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter the stance of a dragon and make powerful leg strikes like a lashing dragon's tail. You can make dragon tail attacks that deal `1d10` bludgeoning damage. They are in the brawling group and have the [backswing](rules/traits/backswing.md), [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md), and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.

While in Dragon Stance, you can ignore the first square of difficult terrain while [Striding](rules/actions/stride.md).

## Dragon Stance leads to...

[Dragon Roar](compendium/feats/dragon-roar.md)
