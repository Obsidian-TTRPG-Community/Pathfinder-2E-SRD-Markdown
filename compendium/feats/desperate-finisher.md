[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** You complete the last action on your turn, and your turn has not ended yet.
- **Requirements**: You meet the requirements to use an action with the [press](rules/traits/press.md "Press Combat Trait") trait.
- **Activity** Reaction

You throw everything into one last press. Use a single action that you know with the [press](rules/traits/press.md "Press Combat Trait") trait as part of Desperate Finisher. You forgo the ability to use reactions until the start of your next turn.
