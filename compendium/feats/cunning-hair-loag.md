# Cunning Hair  *Feat 5*  
[changeling](rules/traits/changeling-b1.md "Changeling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your hair moves under your control. You can perform simple [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions with your hair, such as opening an unlocked door. Your hair can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish, and you can't use it to hold items.
