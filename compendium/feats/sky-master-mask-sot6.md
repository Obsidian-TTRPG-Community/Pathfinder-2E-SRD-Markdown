- **Prerequisites**: Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication

Your mask holds the legacy of Black Heron, the Wings of Knowledge, who united the aeromancers of the Shory Empire. You can harness residual magical power to fly. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only you, your fly Speed doubles until your next turn.
