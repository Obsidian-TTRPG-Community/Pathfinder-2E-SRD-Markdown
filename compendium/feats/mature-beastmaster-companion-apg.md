# Mature Beastmaster Companion  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Beastmaster Dedication](compendium/feats/beastmaster-dedication-apg.md)

All of your animal companions grow up, becoming mature animal companions and gaining additional capabilities (Core Rulebook 214). During an encounter, even if you don't use the [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) action, your animal companion can still use 1 action on your turn to either [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) or [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).

## Mature Beastmaster Companion leads to...

[Incredible Beastmaster Companion](compendium/feats/incredible-beastmaster-companion-apg.md), [Specialized Beastmaster Companion](compendium/feats/specialized-beastmaster-companion-apg.md), [Lead The Pack](compendium/feats/lead-the-pack-apg.md)
