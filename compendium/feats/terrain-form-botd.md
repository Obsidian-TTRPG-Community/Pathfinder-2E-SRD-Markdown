You crumble to pieces, becoming composed of the very terrain to which you're bound, with the effects of the [gaseous form](compendium/spells/gaseous-form.md) spell, or you reconstitute into your normal form. The substance you're formed of depends upon your bound terrain, and the action gains the corresponding trait or traits.

- **Desert** Sand ([earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait"))
