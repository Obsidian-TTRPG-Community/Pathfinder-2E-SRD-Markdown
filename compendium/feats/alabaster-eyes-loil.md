# Alabaster Eyes  *Feat 1*  
[vishkanya](rules/traits/vishkanya-loil.md "Vishkanya Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


In place of the normal vishkanyan golden eyes, you were born with especially perceptive snow-white eyes. You gain darkvision.

**Special.** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain out of this feat or into this feat.
