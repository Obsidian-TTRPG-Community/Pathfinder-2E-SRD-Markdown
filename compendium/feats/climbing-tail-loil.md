# Climbing Tail  *Feat 1*  
[vanara](rules/traits/vanara-loil.md "Vanara Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your tail makes it much easier for you to climb. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md), you gain the [Combat Climber](compendium/feats/combat-climber.md) skill feat, and you reduce the number of free hands required to [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md) or [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) by one.
