# Relentless Stalker  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 2*  
[move](rules/traits/move.md)  [ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Trigger** An adjacent creature you are hunting attempts to move away from you using an action that has the [move](rules/traits/move.md) trait.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your hunted prey cannot escape your relentless pursuit. [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed in tandem with the triggering creature, remaining adjacent to the foe throughout its movement until it stops moving or you run out of movement. You can ignore difficult terrain during this movement unless the difficult terrain is caused by a [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) effect.
