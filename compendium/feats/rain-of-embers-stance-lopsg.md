# Rain Of Embers Stance  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[fire](rules/traits/fire.md)  [monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter the stance of an enraged phoenix, holding your fingers as rigid as deadly talons while moving with quick, flickering gestures that dance with biting flames. The only [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) you can make are fire talon [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md). These deal `1d4` fire damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md), [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md), [fire](rules/traits/fire.md), [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md), and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.

While in Rain of Embers Stance, you gain a +1 status bonus to AC and fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1).

## Rain Of Embers Stance leads to...
