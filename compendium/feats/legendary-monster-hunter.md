# Legendary Monster Hunter  *Feat 16*  
[ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md "Ranger Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Master Monster Hunter](compendium/feats/master-monster-hunter.md)

Your knowledge of monsters is so incredible that it reveals glaring flaws in your prey. Your bonus from [Monster Hunter](compendium/feats/monster-hunter.md) (and the bonus from [Monster Warden](compendium/feats/monster-warden.md) if you have it) increases from +1 to +2 for you and any allies who benefit.
