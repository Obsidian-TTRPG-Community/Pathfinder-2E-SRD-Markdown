# Lawbringer  *Feat 1*  
[aasimar](rules/traits/aasimar-apg.md "Aasimar Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  


You trace your lineage to archons: embodiments of heavenly virtues, guardians of the seven-tiered mountain of Heaven, and nurturers of law and virtue within mortals. Your own virtue and orderly mind protect you from foes who would turn your emotions against you. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effects, and if you roll a success on a save against an [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effect, you get a critical success instead.

## Lawbringer leads to...
