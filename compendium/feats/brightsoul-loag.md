# Brightsoul  *Feat 1*  
[ifrit](rules/traits/ifrit-b2.md "Ifrit Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  


The fire inside you asserts itself as beaming, radiant light. Your body is naturally luminescent, glowing with the effects of a primal [light](compendium/spells/light.md) cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. The light is involuntary and constant; if counteracted, it returns in `1d4` rounds. You suffer a â€“2 circumstance penalty on [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md) and gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saves against [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait") effects and effects that inflict the [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) or [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) conditions.
