# Foxfire  *Feat 1*  
[kitsune](rules/traits/kitsune-loag.md "Kitsune Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


A crack of your tail sparks wisps of blue energy. Choose either electricity or fire when you gain this feat. You gain a foxfire ranged unarmed attack with a maximum range of 20 feet. The attack deals `1d4` damage of the chosen type (no ability modifier is added to the damage roll). Your foxfire attack is in the sling weapon group and has the [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") trait. Like other unarmed attacks, you can improve this attack with handwraps of mighty blows.

**Special.** If you are a frozen wind kitsune, your foxfire deals cold damage instead of electricity or fire.
