# Spy's Countermeasures  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lion Blade Dedication](compendium/feats/lion-blade-dedication-lowg.md)

You've learned how to analyze and fake your responses to the most common magic used against spies. Whenever you succeed at your save against a [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait") or [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect, you can [Identify Magic](rules/actions/identify-magic.md) to identify the spell as a free action triggered when you succeed, even if you didn't notice the spell being cast.

If you successfully identify a [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait") effect targeting you and the spell would normally fail or have no effect, you can create a substitute result, causing the spell's caster to think the spell succeeded, with a result of your choice. If you successfully identify a [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect targeting you and the spell would normally fail or have no effect, you can make it appear as if you were affected and attempt to play along with the spell; if the spell normally establishes a mental link, it functions normally but you can disregard any commands you receive through the link.
