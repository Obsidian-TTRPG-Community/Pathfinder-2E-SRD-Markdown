# Mask Of Power  *Feat 5*  
[orc](rules/traits/orc.md "Orc Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Orc Warmask](compendium/feats/orc-warmask-loag.md)

Your warmask sharpens your connection to the source of your mask's power. During your daily preparations, choose [fear](compendium/spells/fear.md), [phantom pain](compendium/spells/phantom-pain.md), or [true strike](compendium/spells/true-strike.md).

Until your next daily preparations, you can cast this spell as a 1st-level innate spell once per day; the spell's tradition is determined by the tradition tied to your warmask. You must be wearing your warmask to [Cast the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md).
