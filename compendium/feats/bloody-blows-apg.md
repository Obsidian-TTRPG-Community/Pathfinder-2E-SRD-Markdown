# Bloody Blows  *Feat 5*  
[orc](rules/traits/orc.md "Orc Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your lethal unarmed attacks leave bloody gouges or cause severe internal bleeding. When you critically hit with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) using an unarmed attack that isn't [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait"), the target takes `1d4` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). This can be because you're taking the penalty to use a fist for a lethal attack or because you have an unarmed attack without the [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait") trait due to [Iron Fists](compendium/feats/iron-fists-apg.md), [Tusks](compendium/feats/tusks-apg.md), or a similar ability.
