# Archaeologist's Luck  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Archaeologist Dedication](compendium/feats/archaeologist-dedication-apg.md)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger** You fail a check against a trap, such as a [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check to [Disable](rules/actions/disable-a-device.md) the trap or a Reflex save to avoid its effects.

You are more than just skillful; your drive to find the secrets of the past manifests as a strange kind of luck. Reroll the failed check and use the new result.
