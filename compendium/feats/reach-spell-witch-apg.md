# Reach Spell (Witch)  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  [witch](rules/traits/witch-apg.md "Witch Class Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You can extend the range of your spells. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that has a range, increase that spell's range by 30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if the spell normally has a range of touch, you extend its range to 30 feet.
