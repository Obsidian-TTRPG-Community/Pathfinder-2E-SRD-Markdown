- **Prerequisites**: [Shape of the Dragon](compendium/feats/shape-of-the-dragon-apg.md) > [!pf2-note]
> (or [Shape of the Cloud Dragon](compendium/feats/shape-of-the-cloud-dragon-sot3.md))

You've practiced and increased your draconic might, allowing you to take your draconic form more often. You can use [Shape of the Dragon](compendium/feats/shape-of-the-dragon-apg.md) once per hour instead of once per day.
