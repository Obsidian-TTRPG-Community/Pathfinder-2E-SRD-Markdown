# Folksy Patter  *Feat 1*  
[halfling](rules/traits/halfling.md "Halfling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You are adept at disguising coded messages as folksy idioms. Using slang, jokes, halfling loanwords, and the like, you convey a simple message consisting of three basic words (such as "Danger assassin flee" or "Meet me moonrise"). Your intended listener can attempt a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check to discern the message (DC 20 if an ally, DC 15 if a halfling ally, DC 10 if a halfling ally with Folksy Patter). Eavesdroppers can also attempt a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check against your [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) DC to discern your meaning. Any bonuses or penalties to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to [Sense Motive](rules/actions/sense-motive.md) apply.
