# Wolf in Sheep's Clothing  *Feat 4*  
[ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md "Ranger Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception)

With a bit of hide, some antlers, and some cast-off fur, you can create a disguise that will fool even an experienced hunter.

You can [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) creatures with the animal, [beast](rules/traits/beast.md "Beast Creature Type Trait"), or [plant](rules/traits/plant.md "Plant Creature Type Trait") traits, so long as they are either the same size or one size larger than you and have a body shape that conforms at least vaguely to your own (in other words, a typical humanoid could [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) a bear or an arboreal, but not a horse, giant scorpion, or assassin vine). Impersonating a larger creature doesn't change your actual size.
