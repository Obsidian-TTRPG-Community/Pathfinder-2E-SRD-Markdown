# Torch Goblin  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 5*  
[goblin](rules/traits/goblin.md "Goblin Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: charhide goblin  heritage
- **Activity** Single Action

You've spent enough time on fire that you know how to use it to your advantage.

You can light yourself thoroughly on fire with a held torch, a bottle of alchemist's fire, or a similar incendiary, dealing yourself `1d6` [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). As long as you are suffering [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), all your melee attacks against adjacent creatures deal an additional 1 fire damage per weapon damage die. Any creature that successfully Grapples, Shoves, or Trips you takes `1d6` fire damage; if it uses a weapon for that action, the weapon takes the damage instead. You must still attempt the flat check to remove the [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) each round, as normal.
