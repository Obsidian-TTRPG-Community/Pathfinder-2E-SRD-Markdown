# Reaper Of Repose  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Reclaimant Dedication](compendium/feats/knight-reclaimant-dedication-locg.md), master proficiency in a weapon

Your skill and fervor allow you to pierce undead defenses and exploit their weaknesses. When you make an attack using a weapon with which you have master proficiency and hit an undead creature, you ignore 5 points of the creature's resistances, and the undead's weaknesses are 2 higher against your attack.
