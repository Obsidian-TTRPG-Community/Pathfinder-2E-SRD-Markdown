# Numb To Death  *Feat 7*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Diehard](compendium/feats/diehard.md), you have died at least once
- **Frequency**: once per day

Your past has left you numb to death's call. The first time each day that you regain Hit Points while you are [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying), you regain additional Hit Points equal to your level, and you neither gain the [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition nor increase the value of this condition.
