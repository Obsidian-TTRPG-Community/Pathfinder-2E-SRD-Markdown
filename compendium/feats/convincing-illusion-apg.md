# Convincing Illusion  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md "Wizard Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception)
- **Trigger** A creature succeeded, but didn't critically succeed, at a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check or Will save to 0 from a spell that you cast.
- **Requirements**: You are within 30 feet of the observer and the illusion.
- **Activity** Reaction

You use your deceptive skills to make your illusions seem even more real. Attempt a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check against the target's [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC. If you succeed, the target fails to 0.
