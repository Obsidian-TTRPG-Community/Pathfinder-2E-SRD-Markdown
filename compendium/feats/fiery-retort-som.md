[druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: flame order
- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Trigger** An opponent adjacent to you hits you with a melee weapon or a melee unarmed attack.
- **Activity** Reaction

Ignoring your pain, you sear your attacker with a wave of flame. The triggering opponent takes fire damage equal to your level.
