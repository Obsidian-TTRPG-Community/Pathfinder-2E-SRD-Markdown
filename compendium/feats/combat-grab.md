# Combat Grab  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  [press](rules/traits/press.md "Press Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You have one hand free, and your target is within reach of that hand.
- **Activity** Single Action

You swipe at your opponent and grab at them. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) while keeping one hand free. If the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) hits, you grab the target using your free hand. The creature remains [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) until the end of your next turn or until it [Escapes](rules/actions/escape.md), whichever comes first.
