# Intimidating Glare  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation)

You can [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) with a mere glare. When you do, [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) loses the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md) trait and gains the [visual](rules/traits/visual.md) trait, and you don't take a penalty if the creature doesn't understand your language.

## Intimidating Glare leads to...

[Terrifying Howl](compendium/feats/terrifying-howl.md)
