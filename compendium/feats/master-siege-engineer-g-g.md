# Master Siege Engineer  *Feat 16*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  


What you don't know about artillery isn't worth knowing and your mastery allows you to perform an impossible number of actions as part of a siege weapon's crew. You're permanently [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened). You can only use the extra action to Aim or Launch a siege weapon.
