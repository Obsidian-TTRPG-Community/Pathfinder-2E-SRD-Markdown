# Lead Climber  *Feat 2*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics)

When climbing, you can prepare routes for others to follow, and you can pull your allies up to avoid disaster. When your allies attempt to [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md) a route you set using the [Follow the Expert](rules/actions/follow-the-expert.md) exploration activity, if any of them critically fail their checks to [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md), you can attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check against the same DC. If you succeed, your ally fails instead of critically failing. If you also critically fail, you both experience the consequences of the critical failure.
