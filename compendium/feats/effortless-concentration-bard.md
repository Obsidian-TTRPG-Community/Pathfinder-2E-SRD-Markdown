# Effortless Concentration (Bard)  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 16*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** Your turn begins.
- **Activity** Free Action

You maintain a spell with hardly a thought. You immediately gain the effects of a [Sustain a Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) action, allowing you to extend the duration of one of your active bard spells.
