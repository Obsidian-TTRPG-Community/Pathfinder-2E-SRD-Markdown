# Versatile Performance  *Feat 1*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Polymath muse

You can rely on the grandeur of your performances rather than ordinary social skills. You can use [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) instead of [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) and instead of [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) to [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md). You can also use an acting [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) instead of [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md). You can use your proficiency rank in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) to meet the requirements of skill feats that require a particular rank in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), or [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation).
