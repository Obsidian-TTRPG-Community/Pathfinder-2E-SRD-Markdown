# Cleansing Light  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 17*  
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [kashrishi](rules/traits/kashrishi-loil.md)  [light](rules/traits/light.md)  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [occult](rules/traits/occult.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

A burst of light from your horn cleanses your allies of ailments and sends your foes reeling. You and all allies in a 20-foot emanation benefit from a 4th-level [restoration](compendium/spells/restoration.md) spell. All enemies within the emanation are [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until the end of your next turn.
