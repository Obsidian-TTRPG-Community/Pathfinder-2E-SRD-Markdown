# Spring Attack  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  [press](rules/traits/press.md "Press Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You are adjacent to an enemy.
- **Activity** Single Action

Springing away from one foe, you [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) at another. [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed, but you must end that movement within melee reach of a different enemy. At the end of your movement, make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against an enemy now within reach. You can use Spring Attack while [Burrowing](rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climbing](rules/actions/climb.md), [Flying](rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Striding](rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
