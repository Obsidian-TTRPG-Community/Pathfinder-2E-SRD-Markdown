# Read Disaster  *Feat 8*  
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md "Exploration Action & Ability Trait")  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md "Oracle Class Trait")  [prediction](rules/traits/prediction.md "Prediction Effect Trait")  


You spend 10 minutes and open yourself to the divine mysteries of the world, peering into the most sinister portents of the future. You gain the effects of [augury](compendium/spells/augury.md), except you learn only about the dangers ahead; any results of "weal" are instead "nothing," and results of "weal and woe" are instead "woe." If you are legendary in [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion), you take only 1 minute to Read Disaster.
