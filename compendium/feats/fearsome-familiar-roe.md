# Fearsome Familiar  [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 6*  
[impulse](rules/traits/impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](rules/traits/kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: a familiar
- **Activity** Three-Action

Your elemental familiar trades places with an elemental from its elemental plane. Summon a common creature that has the [elemental](rules/traits/elemental.md "Elemental Creature Type Trait") trait and a level no greater than your level – 4.

This creature appears in the same space as your familiar, which disappears for the duration of this impulse. You can Sustain this impulse up to 1 minute. When the impulse ends, the familiar appears in the space the summoned elemental occupied. A familiar can endure this process only so often—if you use this impulse on your familiar more than once per day, it dies as soon as it returns the second time.
