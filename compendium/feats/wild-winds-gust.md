# Wild Winds Gust  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 14*  
[air](rules/traits/air.md)  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Wild Winds Initiate](compendium/feats/wild-winds-initiate.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in wild winds stance.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You store up energy and release it in an enormous gust of rushing wind. Make a wind crash [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against each creature in your choice of a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line. These attacks all count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you make all the attacks.
