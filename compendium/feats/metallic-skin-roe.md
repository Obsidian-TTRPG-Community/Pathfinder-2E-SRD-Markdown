Duration 1 minute You fortify your natural resistances with elemental metal, covering your skin with thick metal. You gain a +2 status bonus to AC and resistance 10 to physical damage (except adamantine), but you take a â€“10-foot penalty to Speed. If you take fire damage while this ability is active, until the end of your next turn, you deal an additional `2d6` fire damage with all your unarmed melee Strikes.
