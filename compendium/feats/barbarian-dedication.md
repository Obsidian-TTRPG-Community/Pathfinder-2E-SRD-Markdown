# Barbarian Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [multiclass](rules/traits/multiclass.md "Multiclass Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Strength 14, Constitution 14

You become trained in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics); if you were already trained in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You become trained in barbarian class DC.

You can use the [Rage](rules/actions/rage.md) action.

Choose an instinct|Barbarian||1 as you would if you were a barbarian. You have that instinct for all purposes and become bound by its anathema, but you don't gain any of the other abilities it grants.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the barbarian archetype.

## Barbarian Dedication leads to...
