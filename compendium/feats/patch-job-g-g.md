# Patch Job  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vehicle Mechanic Dedication](compendium/feats/vehicle-mechanic-dedication-g-g.md)

You can patch up damage to an object with a quick fix. You gain the Improvised Repair general feat. When you use Improvised Repair, you can attempt a [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check with the same DC as [Repair](rules/actions/repair.md). If you succeed, you can use the object as a normal object of its type until it takes damage rather than as a shoddy object of its type.
