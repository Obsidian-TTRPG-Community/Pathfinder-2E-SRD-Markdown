# Histrionic Injury  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 5*  
[mental](rules/traits/mental.md)  [poppet](rules/traits/poppet-lotgb.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger** A creature you can see damages you with a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

You respond with a startled look, dramatic pratfall, or theatrical arm-flailing that stymies your attacker. The attacker must succeed at a Will saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or become [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 round ([stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) on a critical failure).
