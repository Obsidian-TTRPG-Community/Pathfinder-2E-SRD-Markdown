[automaton](rules/traits/automaton-g-g.md "Automaton Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your animating magic provides some defense. Choose one of the following energy damage types: cold, electricity, or sonic.

You gain resistance 5 to that damage type.

**Enhancement** You tap deeper into your animating magic, and your resistances improve. Choose one of the following benefits: you gain resistance 5 to the remaining two damage types from the above list, or your chosen resistance increases to a value equal to 1 + half your level.
