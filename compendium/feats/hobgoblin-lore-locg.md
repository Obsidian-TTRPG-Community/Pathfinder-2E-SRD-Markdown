# Hobgoblin Lore  *Feat 1*  
[hobgoblin](rules/traits/hobgoblin-locg.md "Hobgoblin Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You've studied traditional hobgoblin exercises and fieldcraft, all of which have a militaristic bent. You become trained in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) and [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting). For each of these skills in which you were already trained, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Hobgoblin Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).
