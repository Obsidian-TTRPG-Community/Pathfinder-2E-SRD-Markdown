# Bloodline Metamorphosis  *Feat 20*  
[sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  


You have learned to manipulate the innate power of your bloodline and adapt it to your needs. When making your daily preparations, you can swap out a single spell of 9th level or lower for another spell of the same level. You can't swap out spells granted specifically by your bloodline.
