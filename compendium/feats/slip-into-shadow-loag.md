# Slip Into Shadow  *Feat 9*  
[dhampir](rules/traits/dhampir-b1.md "Dhampir Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: ability to cast at least one spell with the [darkness](rules/traits/darkness.md "Darkness Effect Trait") trait

Your shadow magic bleeds into the space around you. Whenever you cast a spell with the [darkness](rules/traits/darkness.md "Darkness Effect Trait") trait, a lingering aura of shadows reduces bright light within a 5-foot emanation around you to dim light until the end of your turn.

Like in natural dim light, you can use these shadows to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md), but the aura still makes your overall position obvious, so you can't become [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) through the use of these shadows alone.
