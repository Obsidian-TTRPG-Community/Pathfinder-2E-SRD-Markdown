- **Prerequisites**: [Elementalist Dedication](compendium/feats/elementalist-dedication-roe.md), air or water is in your elemental philosophy
- **Activity** Single Action

As you use your magic to manipulate air or water, you divert some of its currents to form a barrier around you. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with the [air](rules/traits/air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait") or [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") trait, until the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC or a +2 circumstance bonus against ranged attacks. This effect has the [air](rules/traits/air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait") or [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") trait, or both, depending on the traits of the spell you cast. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saves against effects with the [air](rules/traits/air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait") trait, [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") trait, or both until the start of your next turn, depending on the spell's traits.
