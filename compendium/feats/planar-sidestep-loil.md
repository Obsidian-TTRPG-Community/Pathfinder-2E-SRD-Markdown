[arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [ifrit](rules/traits/ifrit-b2.md "Ifrit Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [oread](rules/traits/oread-b2.md "Oread Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [suli](rules/traits/suli-b2.md "Suli Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [sylph](rules/traits/sylph-b2.md "Sylph Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [undine](rules/traits/undine-b2.md "Undine Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** A creature hits you with a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

You shift your body briefly between planes, reducing the damage from your foe's attack. You gain resistance 25 to all damage against the triggering attack.

Observers simply see you shimmer with elemental energy for a moment, just as the attack lands.
