- **Activity** Single Action

Your composition takes the form of a call-and-response chant, which lets your allies continue the effect without you. If your next action is to cast a composition cantrip with a duration of 1 round, it becomes a call. While the spell is active, one ally affected by the spell can respond to your call as a single action that has the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md) and [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md) traits to extend the spell's duration by 1 round. Only one ally can respond to a given call, and responding to the ally's response has no additional effect.
