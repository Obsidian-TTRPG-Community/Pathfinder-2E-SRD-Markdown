# Warren Friend  *Feat 1*  
[downtime](rules/traits/downtime.md)  [ratfolk](rules/traits/ratfolk-b1.md)  


You're adept at making contact with other ysoki. When you arrive at a new settlement, you automatically find the nearest ratfolk enclave by spending 1 day of downtime searching, provided one exists and its members aren't actively hiding from you. Once you've made contact, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Gather Information](rules/actions/gather-information.md) and [Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md) in the settlement.
