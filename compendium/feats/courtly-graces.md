[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society)

You were raised among the nobility or have learned proper etiquette and bearing, allowing you to present yourself as a noble and play games of influence and politics. You can use [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on a noble, as well as with [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) to pretend to be a noble if you aren't one. If you want to impersonate a specific noble, you still need to use [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) normally, and to [Lie](rules/actions/lie.md) when necessary.
