# Skillful Tail (Ganzi)  *Feat 5*  
[ganzi](rules/traits/ganzi-loag.md)  


You have a tail or similar body part that is always willing to lend a hand (so to speak). You can perform simple [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions with your tail, such as opening an unlocked door. Your tail can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish, and you can't use it to hold items.

## Skillful Tail (Ganzi) leads to...

[Larcenous Tail](compendium/feats/larcenous-tail-loag.md), [Mischievous Tail](compendium/feats/mischievous-tail-loag.md)
