# Adapted Cantrip  *Feat 1*  
[human](rules/traits/human.md "Human Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: spellcasting class feature

Through study of multiple magical traditions, you've altered a spell to suit your spellcasting style. Choose one cantrip from a magical tradition other than your own. If you have a spell repertoire or a spellbook, replace one of the cantrips you know or have in your spellbook with the chosen spell. If you prepare spells without a spellbook (if you're a cleric or druid, for example), one of your cantrips must always be the chosen spell, and you prepare the rest normally. You can cast this cantrip as a spell of your class's tradition.

If you swap or retrain this cantrip later, you can choose its replacement from the same alternate tradition or a different one.
