# Ghoran Lore  *Feat 1*  
[ghoran](rules/traits/ghoran-loil.md "Ghoran Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


The very first memories ghorans have are those of their creation, and even after thousands of years, those memories have never faded for you. You become trained in [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) and [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Ghoran Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).
