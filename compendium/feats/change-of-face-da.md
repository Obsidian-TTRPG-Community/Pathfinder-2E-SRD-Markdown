# Change of Face  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Alter Ego Dedication](compendium/feats/alter-ego-dedication-da.md)

You know that for the best disguise to work, one requires not only the right skills but also the right lookâ€”luckily you can copy both using special magical techniques. When you [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md), you don't need a disguise kit; instead, simple illusions or temporary transmutations ripple over your body like mirror shards, providing the supplies that the kit ordinarily would. When you [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) in this way, your [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) activity gains the [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait") trait.
