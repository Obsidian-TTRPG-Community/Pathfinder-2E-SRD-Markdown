title: Blizzard Evasion [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: You take 40 or more physical damage from a single attack

**Effect** You designate a single creature as your mark. This lasts until the mark dies or you use Mark for Death again. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) your mark and on [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks to [Feint](rules/actions/feint.md) against your mark. Your [agile](rules/traits/agile.md) and [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md) weapons and unarmed attacks gain the backstabber and [deadly <d6>](rules/traits/deadly.md) weapon traits when you're attacking your mark.

If the weapon or unarmed attack already has the [deadly](rules/traits/deadly.md) trait, increase the size of the deadly damage die by one step instead of giving it deadly <d6>.
