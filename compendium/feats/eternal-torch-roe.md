# Eternal Torch  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [impulse](rules/traits/impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](rules/traits/kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You open a connection to your kinetic gate, large enough for a torch flame to flow. You create a magical, torch-like flame within 120 feet in any color you choose. It's as bright and hot as a torch.

You can have it orbit a target willing creature or emit from a target object that's unattended or attended by a willing creature.

If you create a flame on a weapon, you still need to use it as an improvised weapon to attack with the flame, just as with a torch.

The flame has an unlimited duration. You can have a maximum number of Eternal Torches equal to your Constitution modifier, and you can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) each torch individually.
