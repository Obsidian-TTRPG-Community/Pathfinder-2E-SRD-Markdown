- **Activity** Single Action

You shape your kinetic aura into swirling armor of steam that scalds your enemies and propels you on super-heated jet streams. A creature can take damage from Steam Knight only once per round. Your steam armor has the following effects.

- You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed.
- When you [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md), you can jump up to your Speed. You don't immediately fall at the end of a jump, provided you [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) again with your next action. If you [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) over a creature and come within 10 feet, that creature takes `2d6` fire damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC.
- At the start of each of your turns, you can emit steam as a free action. It deals `2d6` fire damage to each creature in your kinetic aura with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. A creature that fails is also pushed 5 feet.
