# Accursed Clay Fist  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Golem Grafter Dedication](compendium/feats/golem-grafter-dedication-ec3.md), expert in unarmed attacks

When you make an unarmed [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with your clay fist and hit, your target takes a â€“2 status penalty to saving throws against [curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait") effects for 1 hour.

**Special.** The damage die for your clay fist is `1d8`, and it loses the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait") and [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait") traits of a typical fist.
