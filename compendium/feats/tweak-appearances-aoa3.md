# Tweak Appearances  *Feat 2*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

You spend 1 minute making quick adjustments to someone's clothing and appearance, causing their words to carry more weight with an audience of your choice. While speaking to that audience, the target gains a +1 item bonus to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) and [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks. If you have master proficiency in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting), the bonus increases to +2; if you have legendary proficiency in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting), the bonus increases to +3. This bonus lasts until this ability is used on the target again, the situation they were prepared for ends, or they next change their outfit.
