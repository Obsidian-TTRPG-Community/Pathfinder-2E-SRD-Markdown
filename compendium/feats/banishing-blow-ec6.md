# Banishing Blow  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 20*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Fiendsbane Oath](compendium/feats/fiendsbane-oath.md)
- **Trigger** You use your champion's reaction, triggered by a fiend within your reach.
- **Activity** Free Action

The erratic teleportation magic you experienced in the Kortos Mounts has taught you a few tricks. You attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) the fiend that triggered your champion's reaction; on a success, the target can't teleport or summon creatures for 1 minute. On a critical success, the target is also [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) and can't teleport or summon creatures for 1 hour, and if you are on your home plane and the target is a fiend of level 18 or lower from another plane, it is also banished to its home plane. Your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this attack.
