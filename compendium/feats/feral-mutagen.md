# Feral Mutagen  *Feat 8*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md "Alchemist Class Trait")  


Your bestial mutagen brings out the beast lurking within you, granting you especially sharp claws and teeth as well as a ferocious appearance. Whenever you're affected by a bestial mutagen, you gain the mutagen's item bonus to your [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks. In addition, your claws and jaws are increasingly vicious, and they gain the [deadly <d10>](rules/traits/deadly-d10.md "Deadly Weapon Trait") trait. Finally, you can increase the mutagen's penalty to AC from –1 to –2 and, in exchange, increase the damage die size of your claws and jaws by one step.
