# Irriseni Ice-witch  *Feat 13*  
[human](rules/traits/human.md "Human Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Jadwiga ethnicity, wintertouched human heritage (page 11)

You can trace your direct descent from one of the Queens of Irrisen and thus from Baba Yaga herself. Your resistance to cold increases to 5 + half your level, and you can cast 5th-level [wall of ice](compendium/spells/wall-of-ice.md) as an innate arcane spell once per day.
