# Instinctive Obfuscation  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 13*  
[gnome](rules/traits/gnome.md "Gnome Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: at least one arcane or occult innate spell gained from a gnome heritage or gnome ancestry feat
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You are attacked by a foe.
- **Activity** Reaction

The magic within you manifests as a natural reaction to threats. You gain the effects of [mirror image](compendium/spells/mirror-image.md) but with two images instead of three. The tradition of this action matches the tradition of your gnome ancestry options.
