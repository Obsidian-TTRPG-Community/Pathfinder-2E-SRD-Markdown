# Goblin Lore  *Feat 1*  
[goblin](rules/traits/goblin.md "Goblin Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You've picked up skills and tales from your goblin community. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature) and [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Goblin Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).
