# Stalwart Standard  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cavalier's Banner](compendium/feats/cavaliers-banner-apg.md), [Knight Vigilant Dedication](compendium/feats/knight-vigilant-dedication-locg.md)

Your banner makes it harder for your foes to push your allies around and encourages your allies to protect the innocent. Allies benefiting from your Cavalier's Banner feat also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to their Fortitude and Reflex DCs against attempts to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md), [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md), and [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md). Each benefited ally also gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls against any creature that has dealt damage to an innocent of a lower level than that ally within the last round; summoned creatures, companions, or any creatures you or your allies put into danger on purpose to attempt to gain this bonus don't count.
