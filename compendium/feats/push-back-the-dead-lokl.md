You call to your ally and strengthen their resolve and abilities to defend against the horrific tricks undead bring to bear. The ally gains a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against effects originating from undead. It also gains resistance to damage from [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) made by undead creatures equal to half your Charisma modifier.
