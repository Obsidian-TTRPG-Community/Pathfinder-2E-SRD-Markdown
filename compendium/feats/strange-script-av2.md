# Strange Script  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Eldritch Researcher Dedication](compendium/feats/eldritch-researcher-dedication-av2.md)

You have such familiarity with obscure texts that you can compel them to reveal their secrets. Once per day, you can touch a single text (such as a tome, a wall of hieroglyphics, or something similar) and understand its meaning for 1 hour. If the text is in multiple languages, you gain the ability to understand them all for only the purposes of reading the text. If the text is in a code or cypher, you don't automatically understand the text, but you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to decipher it.
