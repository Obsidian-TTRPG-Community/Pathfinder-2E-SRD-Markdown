# Breath Control  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  


You have incredible breath control, which grants you advantages when air is hazardous or sparse. You can hold your breath for 25 times as long as usual before suffocating. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against [inhaled](rules/traits/inhaled.md "Inhaled Item Trait") threats, such as [inhaled](rules/traits/inhaled.md "Inhaled Item Trait") poisons, and if you roll a success on such a saving throw, you get a critical success instead.
