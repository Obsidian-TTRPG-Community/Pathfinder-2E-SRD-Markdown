# Medic Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine), [Battle Medicine](compendium/feats/battle-medicine.md)

You become an expert in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine). When you succeed with [Battle Medicine](compendium/feats/battle-medicine.md) or [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md), the target regains 5 additional HP at DC 20, 10 HP at DC 30, or 15 HP at DC 40. Once per day, you can use [Battle Medicine](compendium/feats/battle-medicine.md) on a creature that's temporarily immune. If you're a master in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine), you can do so once per hour.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the medic archetype.

## Medic Dedication leads to...

[Doctor's Visitation](compendium/feats/doctors-visitation-apg.md), [Resuscitate](compendium/feats/resuscitate-apg.md), [Treat Condition](compendium/feats/treat-condition-apg.md), [Holistic Care](compendium/feats/holistic-care-apg.md), [Preventative Treatment](compendium/feats/preventative-treatment-lokl.md)
