[champion](rules/traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: divine ally (steed), [Loyal Warhorse](compendium/feats/loyal-warhorse.md)

During an encounter, even if you don't use the [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) action, your mount can still use 1 action on your turn to [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) or [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).

## Imposing Destrier leads to...
