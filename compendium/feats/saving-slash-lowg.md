# Saving Slash  [V](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Varies") Varies ([R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")]) *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Aldori Duelist Dedication](compendium/feats/aldori-duelist-dedication-lowg.md)
- **Trigger** An opponent critically hits you with a melee attack.
- **Activity** Varies ([R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")])

You quickly whirl your blade, trying to deflect enough momentum to avoid the worst of the attack. Attempt a DC 16 flat check. If you succeed, the attack becomes a normal hit, instead of a critical hit.
