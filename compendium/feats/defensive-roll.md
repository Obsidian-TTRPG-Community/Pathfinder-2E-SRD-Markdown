[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Trigger** A physical attack would reduce you to 0 Hit Points.
- **Activity** Free Action

Dropping into a roll to disperse the force of the blow, you can partially evade a lethal attack and stay conscious. You take half damage from the triggering attack.
