# Fey Cantrips  *Feat 1*  
[sprite](rules/traits/sprite-b1.md)  


You've learned the cantrips sprites have used since time immemorial. You gain [dancing lights](compendium/spells/dancing-lights.md) and [ghost sound](compendium/spells/ghost-sound.md) as primal innate cantrips. If you have the grig heritage, you also gain [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md), and if you have the draxie heritage, you gain [prestidigitation](compendium/spells/prestidigitation.md).
