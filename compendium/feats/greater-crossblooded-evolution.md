# Greater Crossblooded Evolution  *Feat 18*  
[sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Crossblooded Evolution](compendium/feats/crossblooded-evolution.md)

Your bloodline is extraordinarily complex. You can have up to three spells from other traditions in your spell repertoire, rather than just one. These spells must each be of a different spell level, but they don't need to be from the same tradition.
