# Fey Fellowship  *Feat 1*  
[gnome](rules/traits/gnome.md "Gnome Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your enhanced fey connection affords you a warmer reception from creatures of the First World as well as tools to foil their tricks. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to both [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks and saving throws against [fey](rules/traits/fey.md "Fey Creature Type Trait").

In addition, whenever you meet a fey creature in a social situation, you can immediately attempt a [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a â€“5 penalty to the check. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.

**Special.** If you have the [Glad-Hand](compendium/feats/glad-hand.md) skill feat, you don't take the penalty on your immediate [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check if the target is a fey.
