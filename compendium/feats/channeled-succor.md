# Channeled Succor  *Feat 8*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: healing font

You can remove conditions with divine grace. You can sacrifice one [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) spell you've prepared in your extra slots from healing font to cast one of the following spells instead: [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md), [remove disease](compendium/spells/remove-disease.md), [remove paralysis](compendium/spells/remove-paralysis.md), or [restoration](compendium/spells/restoration.md). The spell is heightened to the same level as the [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) spell you sacrificed.
