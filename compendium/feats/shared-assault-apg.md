# Shared Assault  *Feat 12*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Courageous Assault](compendium/feats/courageous-assault-apg.md)

In the triumph of battle, you can share the glory with another ally. When the ally you chose for Courageous Assault critically succeeds at the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) granted by that action, another ally affected by your [inspire courage](compendium/spells/inspire-courage.md) composition spell can immediately use a reaction to make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). Since the second ally wasn't the ally you chose for Courageous Assault, this effect doesn't continue to a third ally, even if the second ally also critically succeeds at their [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
