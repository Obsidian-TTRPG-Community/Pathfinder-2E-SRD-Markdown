# Pact of Infernal Prowess  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pactbinder Dedication](compendium/feats/pactbinder-dedication-da.md)

You've sworn a pact with devils, granting you success in life in exchange for your soul in the afterlife. Once per hour, when you critically fail a check, you can reroll the check as a free action; this is a [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait") effect. Additionally, you can choose to automatically succeed at checks to [Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md) for tasks below your level, without rolling. However, when you die, your soul is consigned to Hell. You can't be returned to life except by powerful magic such as miracle, and even then, the devils responsible for the contract can track your every move for 1 year. The devils gain the effects of a [discern location](compendium/spells/discern-location.md) spell. They can also use 10th-level [scrying](compendium/spells/scrying.md) on you at will, and you automatically critically fail your saving throw.

**Special.** You can't retrain out of a Pact of Infernal Prowess without journeying to Hell and destroying the devil's written contract spelling out the terms of your pact.
