# Rebirth in Living Stone  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 18*  
[earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait")  [impulse](rules/traits/impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](rules/traits/kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

Rock overflows from within you to consume your form before cracking open to reveal your body transformed into living stone.

You gain 40 temporary Hit Points. You're immune to critical hits and precision damage. You can't be pushed, pulled, or tripped while you're standing on earth or stone. Your earth Elemental Blasts deal an additional `1d10` damage of their normal type.

These benefits last until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain them up to 1 minute. After you gain temporary Hit Points from this impulse, you can't do so again for 10 minutes.
