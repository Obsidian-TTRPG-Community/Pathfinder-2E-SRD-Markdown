- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Single Action

You make a weapon unbearable to hold. Attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) a target creature. You don't need to have a hand free to make this [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) attempt. If the [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) attempt succeeds, the target takes `4d6` fire damage unless it drops the weapon, and on a critical success, it takes `4d6` fire damage and drops the weapon. If you're legendary in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics), this increases to `8d6` fire damage.
