- **Activity** Two-Action

A condensed burst of flame shoots behind you, propelling you forward with its sheer force. [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) up to 40 feet in a straight line. Movement from this impulse ignores difficult terrain and doesn't trigger reactions.

Level (6th) The maximum distance of the [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) is 60 feet. You can choose to [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) up to 40 feet in any direction instead of Striding. If you're in the air at the end of this [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md), you fall normally.

Level (10th) As 6th level, but you hover briefly after leaping into the air. If you [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md), you don't fall until the end of your next turn. If you use Burning Jet again on a subsequent turn, you remain airborne.
