- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](compendium/feats/spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [obscuring mist](compendium/spells/obscuring-mist.md)

When you cast [obscuring mist](compendium/spells/obscuring-mist.md), you can modify it to add the following heightened entry to its effects.

**Heightened (3rd)** Your mist is particularly laden with moisture. Non-magical fires within the area are automatically extinguished. Choose one magical fire or fire spell in the area and attempt to counteract it.
