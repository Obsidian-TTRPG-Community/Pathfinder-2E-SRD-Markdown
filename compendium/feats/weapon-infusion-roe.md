# Weapon Infusion  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 1*  
[infusion](rules/traits/infusion-roe.md "Infusion Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](rules/traits/kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  

- **Activity** Free Action

With a signature flair, you shape blasts of elemental power into the form of a weapon, such as a sword made of whirling wind or a bow that shoots flames. If your next action is an [Elemental Blast](rules/actions/elemental-blast-roe.md), choose a weapon shape for it to take. You can choose to change the blast's damage type to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing—whichever suits the weapon shape—and you can choose other alterations depending on whether you make a melee or ranged blast.

**Melee** Add one of the following traits of your choice: [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait"), [backswing](rules/traits/backswing.md "Backswing Weapon Trait"), [forceful](rules/traits/forceful.md "Forceful Weapon Trait"), [reach](rules/traits/reach.md "Reach Weapon Trait"), [sweep](rules/traits/sweep.md "Sweep Weapon Trait").

**Ranged** Choose one of three options: range increment 100 feet and the [volley <30 feet>](rules/traits/volley-30-feet.md "Volley Weapon Trait") trait, range increment 50 feet and the [propulsive](rules/traits/propulsive.md "Propulsive Weapon Trait") trait, or range increment 20 feet and the [thrown](rules/traits/thrown.md "Thrown Weapon Trait") trait.
