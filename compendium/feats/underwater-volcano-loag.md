# Underwater Volcano  *Feat 17*  
[azarketi](rules/traits/azarketi-loag.md "Azarketi Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You can cast [volcanic eruption](compendium/spells/volcanic-eruption.md) as a 7th-level primal innate spell once per day, except that you can only evoke the volcano on the floor of a body of water, and the effects that normally happen to flying creatures happen to swimming creatures instead.
