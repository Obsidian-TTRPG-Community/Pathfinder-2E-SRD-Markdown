- **Activity** Three-Action

You smash a metal rod into your foe and call lightning to it. Attempt a 1-action melee [Elemental Blast](rules/actions/elemental-blast-roe.md) using the metal element. On a hit, the target is skewered with a metal rod, which gives it a –1 circumstance penalty to AC and saves against electricity; the penalty is –2 if the creature also has the metal trait, is made of metal, or is wearing metal armor. A hit creature immediately takes `1d12` electricity damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The creature can [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to attempt a DC 10 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to pull the lightning rod free.

Level (+6) The electricity damage increases by `1d12`.
