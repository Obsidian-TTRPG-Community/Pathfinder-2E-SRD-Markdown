# Elemental Wrath  *Feat 1*  
[elf](rules/traits/elf.md)  


You are so attuned to the land that you can call forth a bolt of energy from your surroundings. When you gain this feat, select acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You can call to the land to cast the [acid splash](compendium/spells/acid-splash.md) cantrip as an innate primal spell at will, except the spell has only verbal components and deals the type of damage you chose instead of acid damage; the spell gains the trait appropriate to its damage instead of the [acid](rules/traits/acid.md) trait. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
