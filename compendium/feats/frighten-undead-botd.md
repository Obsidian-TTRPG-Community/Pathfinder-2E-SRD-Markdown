# Frighten Undead  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Undead Slayer Dedication](compendium/feats/undead-slayer-dedication-botd.md), trained in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation)
- **Activity** Single Action

Your very presence chills creatures of the night down to their core and you can use the spiritual power and faithful life force of religious verses to frighten even mindless undead. Attempt to [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) an undead target using your [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) modifier instead of your [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) modifier if it's higher. If you use your [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) modifier, the [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) action loses the [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") and [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") traits, as your faith connects to the undead on an instinctual level.
