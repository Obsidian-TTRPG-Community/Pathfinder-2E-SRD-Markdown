# Deflecting Cloud  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 16*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dragon Disciple Dedication](compendium/feats/dragon-disciple-dedication-apg.md), [dragon wings](compendium/spells/dragon-wings.md) sorcerer bloodline spell
- **Frequency**: once every 10 minutes
- **Trigger** You are the target of a ranged attack.
- **Requirements**: You are aware of the attack and currently have dragon wings active.
- **Activity** Reaction

You've mastered a defensive technique unique to the ancient dragons of Bloodsalt: beating your wings to create a billowing cloud of mist. You become momentarily [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from the triggering attack if vision is the attacker's only precise sense. Normally this means the attacker must succeed at a DC 11 flat check to target you. You also gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack.
