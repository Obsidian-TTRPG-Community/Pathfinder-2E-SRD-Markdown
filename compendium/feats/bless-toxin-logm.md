# Bless Toxin  *Feat 7*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting), deity who grants harm divine font

You pour negative energy into toxins you create to further debilitate your targets. When you [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) an alchemical poison (rather than create it with advanced alchemy, [Quick Alchemy](rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md), or another means), it becomes a blessed alchemical poison and gains the [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait") trait. When a creature is afflicted with a blessed alchemical poison, for 1 round, any Hit Points it would regain from a [positive](rules/traits/positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait") effect are reduced by 5, or by 10 if you are legendary in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting).
