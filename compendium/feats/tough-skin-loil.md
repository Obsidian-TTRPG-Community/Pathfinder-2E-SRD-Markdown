# Tough Skin  *Feat 1*  
[kashrishi](rules/traits/kashrishi-loil.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: lethoci heritage or xyloshi heritage

Your skin is medium armor in the plate armor group that grants a +4 item bonus to AC, and has a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of –2, a Speed penalty of –5 feet, a Strength value of 16, and the [comfort](rules/traits/comfort.md) trait. You can never wear other armor or remove your hide. You can etch armor runes onto your hide.

If you're a lethoci kashrishi who takes this feat, your modifications also make you more buoyant, allowing you to [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) across the surface of even turbulent bodies of water without needing to make an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check.

**Special.** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into this feat.
