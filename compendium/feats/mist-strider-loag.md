# Mist Strider  *Feat 13*  
[azarketi](rules/traits/azarketi-loag.md "Azarketi Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Water Strider](compendium/feats/water-strider-loag.md)

You condense the moisture in the air, solidifying it so it can hold your weight.

When you use Water Strider, you can walk on air. You can ascend and descend at a maximum of a 45-degree angle. You still fall at the end of your movement if you don't end on a surface that can support you, as normal for Water Strider.
