# Greenwatcher  *Feat 10*  
[gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  [investigator](rules/traits/investigator-apg.md "Investigator Class Trait")  [ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md "Ranger Class Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Defy Fey

Your experience fighting against and alongside [fey](rules/traits/fey.md "Fey Creature Type Trait") creatures is nearly unrivaled. Any weapon you wield or unarmed attack you make against a [fey](rules/traits/fey.md "Fey Creature Type Trait") creature is treated as [cold iron](compendium/equipment/items/cold-iron.md). Whenever you critically fail a save against a spell cast by a [fey](rules/traits/fey.md "Fey Creature Type Trait") creature, it's instead treated as a normal failure. Whenever you critically succeed on a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a [fey](rules/traits/fey.md "Fey Creature Type Trait") creature, the target is immediately subject to the effects of a [faerie fire](compendium/spells/faerie-fire.md) spell. For the purposes of counteracting this effect, it's an innate 2nd-level [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait") spell.
