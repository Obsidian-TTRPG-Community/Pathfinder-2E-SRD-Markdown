[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](compendium/feats/lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md)

Through the power of your faith or the blessing of a priest, your weapons are fully effective against incorporeal creatures.

Weapons you wield have the effects of a [ghost touch](compendium/equipment/items/ghost-touch.md) property rune for as long as you wield them.
