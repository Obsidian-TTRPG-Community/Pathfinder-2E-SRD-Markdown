# Mindblank Mutagen  *Feat 18*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md)  


With a minor adjustment of ratios in the formula for your serene mutagen, you gain mental protections. When you're affected by a serene mutagen, [detection](rules/traits/detection.md), [revelation](rules/traits/revelation.md), and [scrying](rules/traits/scrying.md) effects of 9th level or lower detect nothing from you or your possessions and auras. For instance, [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) would still detect other magic in the area, but not any magic on you.
