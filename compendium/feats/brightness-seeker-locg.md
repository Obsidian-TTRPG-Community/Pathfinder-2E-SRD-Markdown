# Brightness Seeker  *Feat 9*  
[elf](rules/traits/elf.md "Elf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes studying your surroundings in search of omens related to a particular course of action to cast [augury](compendium/spells/augury.md) as an innate divine spell. Unless the result of the [augury](compendium/spells/augury.md) was "nothing," you gain the following reaction for the next 30 minutes:

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Call Upon the Brightness** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md))

- **Trigger**: You attempt an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw while performing the course of action from your augury, but you haven't rolled yet

**Effect** You gain a +1 status bonus to the triggering check, or a +2 status bonus if the result of the [augury](compendium/spells/augury.md) was "woe" and you proceeded anyway.
