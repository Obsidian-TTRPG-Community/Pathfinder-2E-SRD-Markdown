# Elven Lore  *Feat 1*  
[elf](rules/traits/elf.md "Elf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You've studied in traditional elven arts, learning about arcane magic and the world around you. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) and [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Elven Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).
