# For Love, for Lightning  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Access**: A character who performs a specialized mission for Clarethe Iomedar has access to this option.
- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Reclaimant Dedication](compendium/feats/knight-reclaimant-dedication-locg.md)

Rumors suggest this technique was pioneered by knights who undertook missions for Clarethe Iomedar at the half-moon, but many Crimson Reclaimers have since mastered it. You learn the for love, for lightning focus spell (see below). If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) activity to recite the Crimson Oath and meditate on its teachings; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your knight reclaimant focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs. Charisma is the key spellcasting ability for knight reclaimant focus spells.
