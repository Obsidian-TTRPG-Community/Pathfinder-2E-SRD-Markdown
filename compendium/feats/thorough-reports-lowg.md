[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](compendium/feats/pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md)

Your reports are thorough and informative, and putting your thoughts to paper helps you retain the information. Keep track of each type of creature you successfully identify with [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md). When attempting [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) checks against creatures on your list in later encounters, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and you learn an additional fact about such creatures on a success.

## Thorough Reports leads to...
