# Shameless Request  *Feat 7*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: master in [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy).

You can downplay the consequences or outrageousness of your requests using sheer brazenness and charm. When you [Request](rules/actions/request.md) something, you reduce any DC increases for making an outrageous request by 2, and if you roll a critical failure for your [Request](rules/actions/request.md), you get a failure instead. While this means you can never cause your target to reduce their attitude toward you by making a [Request](rules/actions/request.md), they eventually tire of requests, even though they still have a positive attitude toward you.
