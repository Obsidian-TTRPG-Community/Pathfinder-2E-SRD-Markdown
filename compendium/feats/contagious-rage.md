# Contagious Rage  *Feat 20*  
[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Share Rage](compendium/feats/share-rage.md)

You can drive your allies into a frenzy, granting them incredible benefits. You can ignore the requirements on [Share Rage](compendium/feats/share-rage.md), using it multiple times in a [Rage](rules/actions/rage.md). Allies affected by [Share Rage](compendium/feats/share-rage.md) who accept your anathema for the duration of the [Rage](rules/actions/rage.md) gain your instinct ability and the specialization ability it gains from weapon specialization, but not greater weapon specialization.
