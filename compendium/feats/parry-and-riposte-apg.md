# Parry And Riposte  *Feat 18*  
[swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md "Swashbuckler Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Opportune Riposte

Your parries and finishers allow you to riposte with the slightest provocation. You can use Opportune Riposte against an enemy who fails at a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against you (not just critically fails), provided you have both damaged that creature with a finisher on your last turn and currently have a circumstance bonus to AC from the parry weapon trait, [Dueling Parry](compendium/feats/dueling-parry-apg.md), or Twin Parry.
