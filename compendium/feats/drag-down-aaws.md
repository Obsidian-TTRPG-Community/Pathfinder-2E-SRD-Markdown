- **Activity** Two-Action

While swimming in water at least 10 feet deep, you grab an adjacent creature (on nearby land or in the water) and pull it below the surface. Attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) the creature. On a success, if the creature is on land, in addition to the normal effects of [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), you pull the creature into the water in a space adjacent to you. If the creature is already in the water, on a success, in addition the normal effects of [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), you drag the creature 10 feet deeper into the water, moving 10 feet with the creature. Moving a creature into water or deeper into water using Drag Down is forced movement for the creature but not for you.

## Drag Down leads to...
