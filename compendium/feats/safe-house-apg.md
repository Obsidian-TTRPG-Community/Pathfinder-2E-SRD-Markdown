# Safe House  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vigilante Dedication](compendium/feats/vigilante-dedication-apg.md)

You establish a safe houseâ€”a secure space in which to hide your secrets from the outside world. This safe house is roughly the size of a 10-foot cube. It's in a location you have access to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a hidden room or an underground cave. The safe house protects objects and people inside it from magical detection. This has the effects of nondetection, using your [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) modifier for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the counteract level. Setting up or moving your safe house takes a week of downtime. The size of the safe house expands to four 10-foot cubes if you're an expert in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), eight cubes if you're a master, and 16 cubes if you're legendary.
