[sprite](rules/traits/sprite-b1.md "Sprite Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You can disguise yourself with magical illusions. You can cast [illusory disguise](compendium/spells/illusory-disguise.md) once per day as a 1st-level primal innate spell. At 7th level, the spell is heightened to 2nd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened an additional spell level.
