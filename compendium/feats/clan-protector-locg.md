# Clan Protector  *Feat 5*  
[dwarf](rules/traits/dwarf.md "Dwarf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your clan dagger can protect your allies as easily as yourself. When you use an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to gain a circumstance bonus to AC from your clan dagger's [parry](rules/traits/parry.md "Parry Weapon Trait") trait, you can grant the circumstance bonus to an adjacent ally instead of gaining it yourself. You can use multiple [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions to protect multiple allies, or to protect yourself and an ally. The ally benefits from the bonus to AC only when they are adjacent to you.
