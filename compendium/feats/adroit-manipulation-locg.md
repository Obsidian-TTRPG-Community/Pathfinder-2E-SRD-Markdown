# Adroit Manipulation  *Feat 1*

You've fiddled with knots, locks, and blacksmith's puzzles since you were a child to give your hands something to do. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (or another skill of your choice, if you're already trained in [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery)). If you roll a success on a [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check to [Pick a Lock](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md), you get a critical success instead.
