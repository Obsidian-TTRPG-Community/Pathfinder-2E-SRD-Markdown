# Inspiring Resilience  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [champion](rules/traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.
- **Trigger** You and at least one other creature become the target of a spell or effect with the emotion, [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait"), or [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") trait that allows a saving throw, and you haven't rolled the save yet.
- **Activity** Reaction

You show defiance in times of hardship and inspire your companions to persevere.

Allies within 30 feet of you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to their Will save against the triggering effect, or a +2 circumstance bonus if the effect originated from an undead.
