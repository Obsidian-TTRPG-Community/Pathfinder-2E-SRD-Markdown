# Unbound Freedom  *Feat 13*  
[vanara](rules/traits/vanara-loil.md)  


Your future is no other person's to control, and the cycles of your fate sometimes step in to protect you when that control would be taken from you. Whenever you would gain the [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) condition, you can attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, you don't gain the condition.
