# Ultimate Mercy  *Feat 18*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mercy](compendium/feats/mercy.md)

Your mercy transcends the bounds of life and death. When you use Mercy, you can cast [lay on hands](compendium/spells/lay-on-hands.md) on a creature that died since your last turn to return it to life. The target returns to life with 1 hit point and becomes [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded). You can't use Ultimate Mercy if the triggering effect was disintegrate or a [death](rules/traits/death.md) effect.
