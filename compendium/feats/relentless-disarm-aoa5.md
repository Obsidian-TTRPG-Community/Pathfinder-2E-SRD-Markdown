When you succeed, but don't critically succeed, at a check to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) a creature, your circumstance bonus to further checks to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) that creature is +4 instead of +2. Other creatures gain only the normal bonus.

When you critically succeed at a [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) check, you can immediately [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) your target as a reaction.
