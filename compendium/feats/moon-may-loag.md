# Moon May  *Feat 1*  
[changeling](rules/traits/changeling-b1.md "Changeling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  


Your mother was a moon hag, a handmaiden of Groetus, and you have a single scarlet eye and a sliver of her supernal foresight. You can cast [guidance](compendium/spells/guidance.md) as an occult innate cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
