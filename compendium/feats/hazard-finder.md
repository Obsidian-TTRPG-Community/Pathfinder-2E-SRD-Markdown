# Hazard Finder  *Feat 8*  
[ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md)  


You have an intuitive ability to sense hazards. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to find traps and hazards, to AC against their attacks, and to saves against their effects. You can find hazards that would normally require you to [Search](rules/actions/search.md) even if you aren't [Searching](rules/actions/search.md).
