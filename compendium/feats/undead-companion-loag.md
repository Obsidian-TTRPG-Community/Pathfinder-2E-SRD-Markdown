# Undead Companion  *Feat 5*  
[dhampir](rules/traits/dhampir-b1.md "Dhampir Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: an animal companion or a familiar

Your companion is also touched by undeath, a mix of a traditional companion and a skeleton, zombie, or stranger form of unlife. Your companion gains the [undead](rules/traits/undead.md "Undead Creature Type Trait") trait instead of the [animal](rules/traits/animal.md "Animal Creature Type Trait") trait and gains negative healing. It otherwise uses the normal rules for an animal companion or familiar; that means it can still be affected by many conditions or effects to which most undead are immune.
