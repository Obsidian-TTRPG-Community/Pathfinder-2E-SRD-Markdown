# Repurposed Parts  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Trapsmith Dedication](compendium/feats/trapsmith-dedication-g-g.md)

You are familiar with the fittings and cogwheels of your snares and can repurpose parts from prepared quick-deploy snares to assemble a new creation on the fly. Using two of the snares you prepared for quick deployment during daily preparations, you can quickly deploy a different snare that you know how to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md), even if you didn't prepare that snare during your daily preparations.
