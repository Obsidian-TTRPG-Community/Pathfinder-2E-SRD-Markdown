# Explosive Death Drop  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Blazing Talon Surge](compendium/feats/blazing-talon-surge-lopsg.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in Rain of Embers Stance and have a target [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained).
- **Activity** Single Action

You lift your enemy into the air before bringing them crashing down with a fiery detonation. Roll an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check against your target's Fortitude DC. You take a –1 circumstance penalty to your check if the target is one size larger than you and a –3 circumstance penalty if it's larger than that. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your check if the target is one size smaller than you and a +3 circumstance bonus if it's smaller than that.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target takes `12d6` fire damage and falls [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) in an unoccupied adjacent square of your choice. The target is no longer [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed). The target and any creature adjacent to it also each take `1d6` [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Success** As critical success, but the target takes `6d6` fire damage instead of `12d6`, and creatures don't take [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Failure** The target is no longer [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed).
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but you fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
