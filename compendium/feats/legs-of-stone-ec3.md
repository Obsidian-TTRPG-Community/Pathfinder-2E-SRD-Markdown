- **Prerequisites**: [Golem Grafter Dedication](compendium/feats/golem-grafter-dedication-ec3.md)

You gain a +2 status bonus to your Fortitude and Reflex DCs against attempts to [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) or [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) you. You can [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) creatures even if you don't have a hand free. When you successfully [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) a foe, you can [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) away from your opponent (instead of toward it), but you must move the same distance in the opposite direction from where you Shoved it.
