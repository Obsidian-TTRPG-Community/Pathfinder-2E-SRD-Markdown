- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics)

You become an expert in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics).

Whenever you critically succeed at an [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Tumble Through](rules/actions/tumble-through.md) an enemy's space, you don't treat the enemy's space as difficult terrain.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the acrobat archetype.
