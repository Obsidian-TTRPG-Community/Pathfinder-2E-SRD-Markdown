# Harmless Doll  *Feat 1*  
[poppet](rules/traits/poppet-lotgb.md "Poppet Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You look like nothing more than an ordinary toy, doll, or statuette, and you can fool others with your innocuous appearance. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) (or another skill if you're already trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception)), and you can [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) an inanimate toy or a mindless poppet. You can [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) without any cover or concealment from creatures that don't realize you're alive, so long as you're in a location where a toy of your shape wouldn't be out of place, like a carnival booth, city street, or toy shop (at the GM's discretion). If you succeed, onlookers still see you, but they mistake you for an inanimate toy. After being fooled once, they realize you're alive, and you can't [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) from them in that way again.
