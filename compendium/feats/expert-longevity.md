[elf](rules/traits/elf.md "Elf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ancestral Longevity](compendium/feats/ancestral-longevity.md)

You've continued to refine the knowledge and skills you've gained through your life. When you choose a skill in which to become trained with [Ancestral Longevity](compendium/feats/ancestral-longevity.md), you can also choose a skill in which you are already trained and become an expert in that skill. This lasts until your [Ancestral Longevity](compendium/feats/ancestral-longevity.md) expires.

When the effects of [Ancestral Longevity](compendium/feats/ancestral-longevity.md) and [Expert Longevity](compendium/feats/expert-longevity.md) expire, you can retrain one of your skill increases. The skill increase you gain from this retraining must either make you trained in the skill you chose with [Ancestral Longevity](compendium/feats/ancestral-longevity.md) or make you an expert in the skill you chose with [Expert Longevity](compendium/feats/expert-longevity.md).
