# Idol Threat  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 13*  
[tiefling](rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md "Tiefling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Beastbrood](compendium/feats/beastbrood-loag.md)
- **Requirements**: You're holding something sacred or precious to a creature, such as a relic or personal depiction of their deity or a precious personal memento.
- **Activity** Single Action

You brandish the precious object you're holding menacingly, at once mocking it and threatening its safety. Attempt to [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) the creature whose precious item you threaten. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check to [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md), and on a success, the creature is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) for 1 round out of distraction for the object's safety and is [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 minute (or [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) on a critical success). These conditions are both in addition to the normal effects of [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md). The creature is then temporarily immune to any Idol Threat using that specific object for 1 day.
