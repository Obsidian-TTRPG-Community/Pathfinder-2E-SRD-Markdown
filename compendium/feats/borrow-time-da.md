# Borrow Time  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Chronoskimmer Dedication](compendium/feats/chronoskimmer-dedication-da.md)
- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Trigger** Your turn begins.
- **Activity** Free Action

You reach ahead and make use of time that's yet to be. You become [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) and can use the extra action to [Step](rules/actions/step.md), [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), or [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). You gain this extra action immediately and can use it this turn. At the end of your turn, you become [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
