# Accurate Swing  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [vigilante](rules/traits/vigilante-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Harsh Judgment](compendium/feats/harsh-judgment-ngd.md), [Vigilante Dedication](compendium/feats/vigilante-dedication-apg.md), member of the Gray Gardeners

You strike cleanly with wide, sweeping attacks to inflict maximum damage, taking advantage of your judged foe's fear to land a felling blow. If you [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) a creature you condemned with Harsh Judgment that has the [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition with a sweep melee weapon or a sweep unarmed attack, you gain a circumstance bonus to the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)'s damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice your weapon deals.
