# Waking Dream  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sleepwalker Dedication](compendium/feats/sleepwalker-dedication-da.md)

While in your trance, you can blur the line between dreams and reality for others. You gain the [waking dream](compendium/spells/waking-dream-da.md) focus spell, which you can use only while you're in a Daydream Trance.

You gain a pool of Focus Points with 1 Focus Point and you can [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) by taking a nap for 10 minutes. You become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your spellcasting ability for these spells is Wisdom.
