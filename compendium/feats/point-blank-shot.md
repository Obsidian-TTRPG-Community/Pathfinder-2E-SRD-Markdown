# Point-blank Shot  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  [open](rules/traits/open.md)  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a ranged weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

You take aim to pick off nearby enemies quickly. When using a ranged volley weapon while you are in this stance, you don't take the penalty to your attack rolls from the [volley](rules/traits/volley.md) trait. When using a ranged weapon that doesn't have the [volley](rules/traits/volley.md) trait, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to damage rolls on attacks against targets within the weapon's first range increment.
