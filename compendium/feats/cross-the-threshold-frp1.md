# Cross The Threshold  *Feat 16*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghost Eater Dedication](compendium/feats/ghost-eater-dedication-frp1.md)

You can cast [ethereal jaunt](compendium/spells/ethereal-jaunt.md) as an occult innate spell once per day. You don't need to [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md); instead, it lasts for 10 minutes or until you choose to return to your material form as a free action.
