# Overwhelming Spellstrike  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md "Magus Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md)
- **Requirements**: Your [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) is charged.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You pierce through your foe's resistance. Make a [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md). The spell you cast as part of the [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) ignores an amount of the target's resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage equal to your level. This applies to all damage the spell deals, including [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell. A creature's immunities are unaffected.
