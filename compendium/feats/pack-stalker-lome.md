# Pack Stalker  *Feat 5*  
[gnoll](rules/traits/gnoll-b1.md "Gnoll Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth), [Pack Hunter](compendium/feats/pack-hunter-lome.md)

Ambushes are an honored gnoll tradition. You gain the Terrain Stalker feat and can extend its effects to a single ally so long as they remain within 10 ft. of you. If you have master proficiency in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth), you can extend the effect to two allies. If you have legendary proficiency in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth), you can extend it to four allies.
