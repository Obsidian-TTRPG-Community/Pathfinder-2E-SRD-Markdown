# Phase Arrow  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 16*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Eldritch Archer Dedication](compendium/feats/eldritch-archer-dedication-apg.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Single Action

You can concentrate an immense amount of magic to create a piece of ammunition that phases through everything but your target. Make a bow [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe who is [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed) or [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) to you (but not [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected)). The ammunition travels to your target in a straight line, passing through any non-magical barriers or walls in its way, though magical barriers stop the arrow. The shot ignores all cover, the [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition, the [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) condition, and circumstance bonuses to AC from shields. It has a +4 status bonus to hit creatures wearing any type of armor. The [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)'s damage can't be reduced with a [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) reaction using a non-magical shield.
