# Coordinated Charge  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [open](rules/traits/open.md "Open Combat Trait")  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Marshal Dedication](compendium/feats/marshal-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You heroically dash into the fray, inspiring your allies to follow. You [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed and make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).

If your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) hits and damages an enemy, each ally within 60 feet who saw you hit can use a reaction to [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), but they each must end their [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) closer to the creature you hit than where they started.
