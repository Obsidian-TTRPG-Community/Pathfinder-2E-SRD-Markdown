You channel potent magic into your next shot, empowering it with a blast of crackling energy. Choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire. If you hit with your next attack roll using a firearm or crossbow before the end of your turn, you deal `1d6` additional damage of this type. At 12th level, this increases to `2d6` additional damage, and at 18th level, it increases to `3d6` additional damage.
