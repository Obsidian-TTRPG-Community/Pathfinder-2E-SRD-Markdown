# Virtue-forged Tattoos  *Feat 9*  
[human](rules/traits/human.md "Human Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ornate Tattoo](compendium/feats/ornate-tattoo-locg.md)

Your tattoos are a work of eldritch genius, a masterpiece of art, magic, and skin. Choose a 3rd-level arcane spell from the same school as your Arcane Tattoos, either a common spell or another to which you have access, including a lower-level spell heightened to 3rd level if you wish.

You can cast that spell once per day as an innate arcane spell.
