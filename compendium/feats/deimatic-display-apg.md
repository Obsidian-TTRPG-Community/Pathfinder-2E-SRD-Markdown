# Deimatic Display  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation)
- **Activity** Single Action

Imitating animal threat displays, you make yourself appear larger and more imposing. Roll one [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check to [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) and compare the result to the Will DC of each animal, fungus, and plant creature in a 15-foot cone. When you do, [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) gains the [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") trait, and creatures are affected if they can see you. You don't take a penalty if the creature doesn't understand your language.
