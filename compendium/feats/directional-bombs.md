# Directional Bombs  *Feat 6*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md "Alchemist Class Trait")  


You can lob bombs with great force and a precise trajectory to angle the splash in a cone spraying in a single direction. When throwing an alchemical bomb with the [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") trait, instead of splashing all squares adjacent to the target, you can treat the target's space as the first affected square of a 15-foot cone directed away from you, potentially allowing you to avoid allies and splash deeper into enemy lines. If the target takes up more than a single square, the target's square closest to you is the first affected square of the cone.
