# Heaven's Thunder  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait")  verbal  

- **Prerequisites**: [Jalmeri Heavenseeker Dedication](compendium/feats/jalmeri-heavenseeker-dedication-aoe2.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

With a loud shout, you unleash your ki in a crackling shroud of thunder and lightning that engulfs your body.

Until the end of your next turn, your unarmed attacks and weapons you wield that have the [monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait") trait deal additional electricity damage equal to one-half your level and additional sonic damage equal to one-half your level.

If you also know the [ki blast](compendium/spells/ki-blast.md) ki spell, you can choose to deal either electricity or sonic damage with the spell instead of force while this effect is active (ki blast loses the [force](rules/traits/force.md "Force Energy & Element Trait") trait and gains the [electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait") or [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait") trait instead). Any creature who successfully Grapples you or is successfully Grappled by you also takes this damage immediately after the [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) check is resolved.
