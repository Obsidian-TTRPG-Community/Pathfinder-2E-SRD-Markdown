Even when you don't hit squarely, you can still score a glancing blow. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). It gains the following failure effect.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Failure** Your attack deals any damage it would have dealt on a hit, excluding all damage dice. (This removes damage dice from weapon runes, spells, and special abilities, in addition to weapon damage dice.)
