# Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  


You're exceptional in your use of two weapons. You gain the [Double Slice](compendium/feats/double-slice.md) fighter feat. This serves as Double Slice for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the dual-weapon warrior archetype.

## Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication leads to...

[Dual Thrower](compendium/feats/dual-thrower-apg.md), [Dual-Weapon Blitz](compendium/feats/dual-weapon-blitz-apg.md), [Dual-Weapon Reload](compendium/feats/dual-weapon-reload-apg.md), [Flensing Slice](compendium/feats/flensing-slice-apg.md)
