# Steal Spell  *Feat 16*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  [rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Legendary Thief](compendium/feats/legendary-thief.md), [Loaner Spell](compendium/feats/loaner-spell-apg.md)

When you use Legendary Thief to steal the impossible, you can steal a prepared spell or spontaneous spell from a foe.

The spell is randomly selected from the highest-level spells the foe knows that have a target or area, to a maximum of 8th-level spells; the target loses the appropriate spell slot as if they had cast it themself. You can [Cast the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) once within the next `1d4` rounds, after which the fleeting magic fades; this otherwise works the same as casting a Loaner Spell.
