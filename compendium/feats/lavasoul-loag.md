# Lavasoul  *Feat 1*  
[ifrit](rules/traits/ifrit-b2.md "Ifrit Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  


Your elemental lineage manifests as magma and molten rock, and you can focus the magma into your hand to attack your foes. You gain a magma spike unarmed attack, which requires a free hand to use. This is an [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait"), [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait"), [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") attack in the brawling weapon group that deals `1d4` piercing damage, as well as 1 additional fire damage. Instead of the normal critical specialization effect, the target takes `1d6` [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage); you gain a bonus on this [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to your item bonus to attack rolls on unarmed attacks.
