[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), or [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation); [Firebrand Braggart Dedication](compendium/feats/firebrand-braggart-dedication-locg.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You call out a foe, causing them to become flustered and easier to defeat. Select one creature you can see and declare a challenge. For your challenge, attempt a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), or [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check against that creature's Will DC. Your challenge must include a linguistic, auditory, or visual component and gains the corresponding trait. If you succeed, you gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls with your weapon or unarmed [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) against that foe until the end of your next turn; if you have master proficiency in the skill you used, you gain a +4 status bonus instead, and if you're legendary, you gain a +6 status bonus. On a critical success, the status bonus lasts for 3 rounds instead. Whether you succeed or fail, creatures who witnessed your challenge gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their Will DCs against your attempts to challenge for 1 minute.
