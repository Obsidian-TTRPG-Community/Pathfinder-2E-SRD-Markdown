# Expanded Splash  *Feat 10*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md "Alchemist Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Calculated Splash](compendium/feats/calculated-splash.md)

The particularly volatile compounds that you brew into your bombs result in them creating especially large and powerful explosions. When you throw an [alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait") [bomb](rules/traits/bomb.md "Bomb Item Trait") and that bomb has the [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") trait, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the bomb's usual splash damage, and it deals splash damage to every creature within 10 feet of the target.

## Expanded Splash leads to...

[Mega Bomb](compendium/feats/mega-bomb.md), Controlled Blast
