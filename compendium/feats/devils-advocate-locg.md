# Devil's Advocate  *Feat 1*  
[human](rules/traits/human.md "Human Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: Chelaxian nationality

You know more about the habits of devils than is entirely safe. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks against devils and saving throws against their abilities. In addition, whenever you meet a devil in a social situation, you can immediately attempt a [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a â€“5 penalty to the check. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.

**Special.** If you have the [Glad-Hand](compendium/feats/glad-hand.md) skill feat, you don't take the penalty to your immediate [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check if the target is a devil.
