# Pirate Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation)

As a pirate, you sail the seas in search of enemy ships to plunder. You become trained in [Sailing Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), or become an expert in it if you were already trained. You ignore the effects of difficult terrain or uneven ground caused by a ship's movement. Additionally, you gain the Boarding Assault action.

title: **Boarding Assault** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") ([flourish](rules/traits/flourish.md))


Either [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) twice or attempt an [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check (DC determined by the GM, but usually DC 20) to swing on a rope up to twice your Speed. If you boarded or disembarked from a boat or similar vehicle during this movement, you can make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that deals one additional weapon damage die.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the pirate archetype.
