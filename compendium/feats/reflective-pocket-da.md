# Reflective Pocket  *Feat 5*  
[extradimensional](rules/traits/extradimensional.md "Extradimensional Effect Trait")  [reflection](rules/traits/reflection-da.md "Reflection Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mirror-Risen](compendium/feats/mirror-risen-da.md)

You've formed a connection with a small hand mirror, allowing you to use it as an extradimensional storage space. You can store one item of light Bulk in your mirror at a time. Storing or retrieving an item requires an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action and any creature can do so. While an item is stored within the mirror, the mirror reflects the item's image. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks to Conceal the Object unless someone checks the mirror's reflection.
