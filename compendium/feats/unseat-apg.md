[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cavalier Dedication](compendium/feats/cavalier-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You are riding your mount and wielding a jousting weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

You attempt to knock an opponent off their mount. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a mounted opponent. If your attack hits, attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check against the opponent's Fortitude DC. If you succeed, the foe is knocked off its mount into a space of its choice adjacent to its mount. If you critically succeed, it lands [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
