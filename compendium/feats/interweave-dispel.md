# Interweave Dispel  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md "Sorcerer Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) in your spell repertoire
- **Activity** Single Action

You weave dispelling energy into a spell, sending both effects at a foe. If your next action is to cast a single-target spell against a creature, and you either hit the foe with the spell attack roll or the foe fails its saving throw, you can cast [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) on the foe as a free action, expending a spell slot as normal and targeting one spell effect affecting the foe.
