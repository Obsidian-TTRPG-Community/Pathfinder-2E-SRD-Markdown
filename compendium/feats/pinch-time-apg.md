# Pinch Time  *Feat 9*  
[half-elf](rules/traits/half-elf.md)  


One of your parents has a human life span and another an elven life span, with your own somewhere between. As a result, you have an unusual perspective on time, which you've learned to manifest to aid yourself in moments of stress. You gain [haste](compendium/spells/haste.md) as a 3rd-level arcane innate spell, though you can target only yourself. You can [Cast this Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) once per day.
