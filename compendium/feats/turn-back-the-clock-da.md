# Turn Back the Clock  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Chronoskimmer Dedication](compendium/feats/chronoskimmer-dedication-da.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You fail a skill check or saving throw.
- **Activity** Reaction

After failing a test of skill, you hop back in your personal timeline so you can try again. You reroll the triggering check with a +1 circumstance bonus as you apply your experience from your last attempt. You must use the new result, even if it's worse than your first roll.
