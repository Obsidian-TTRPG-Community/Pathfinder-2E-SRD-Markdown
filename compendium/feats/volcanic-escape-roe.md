# Volcanic Escape  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [impulse](rules/traits/impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](rules/traits/kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [overflow](rules/traits/overflow-roe.md "Overflow Action & Ability Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Trigger** An enemy in your kinetic aura damages you.
- **Activity** Reaction

Lava reflexively explodes underneath you and the creature that hurt you. The triggering enemy takes `1d6` fire damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. You [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) up to half your Speed in any direction; this movement doesn't trigger reactions.
