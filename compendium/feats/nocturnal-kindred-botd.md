[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Vampire Dedication, trained in [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature)

You have an innate connection with other creatures of the night and understand some of them. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) with bats, rats, and wolves. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on such animals.

Once per day, you can cast [animal allies](compendium/spells/animal-allies-som.md) (Pathfinder Secrets of Magic 89) as a divine innate spell, using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. The creatures it summons are bats, rats, and wolves. At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened by an additional level, to a maximum of a 9th-level [animal allies](compendium/spells/animal-allies-som.md) when you are 19th level.
