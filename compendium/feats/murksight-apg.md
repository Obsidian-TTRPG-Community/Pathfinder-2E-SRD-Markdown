Your vision pierces through non-magical fog, mist, rain, and snow. You don't take circumstance penalties to ranged attacks or [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks caused by non-magical precipitation, and your targeted attacks don't require a flat check to succeed against a target [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) only by such effects.
