- **Prerequisites**: dragon instinct
- **Requirements**: You haven't used this ability since you last Raged.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You breathe deeply and exhale powerful energy in a 30-foot cone or 60-foot line, dealing 1d6 damage per level. The area and damage type match those of your dragon (see [Table 3â€“4](rules/tables/dragon-instincts.md)). If you used this ability in the last hour, the area and the damage are halved (15-foot cone or 30-foot line; 1d6 damage for every 2 levels). Each creature in the area must attempt a basic Reflex save.
