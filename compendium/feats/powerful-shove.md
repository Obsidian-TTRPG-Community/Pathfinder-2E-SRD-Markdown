# Powerful Shove  *Feat 4*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Aggressive Block](compendium/feats/aggressive-block.md) or [Brutish Shove](compendium/feats/brutish-shove.md)

You can push larger foes around with your attack. You can use [Aggressive Block](compendium/feats/aggressive-block.md) or [Brutish Shove](compendium/feats/brutish-shove.md) against a creature up to two sizes larger than you.

When a creature you [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) has to stop moving because it would hit an object, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum 1). This happens regardless of how you Shoved the creature.
