You intone a prayer to the dwarven deities [Torag](compendium/setting/deities/torag.md) or [Angradd](compendium/setting/deities/angradd-logm.md), willing a higher power to guide your aim in the heat of battle. On your next [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a ranged weapon before the end of your turn, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your attack roll and ignore your target's [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition, as well as your target's lesser, standard, and greater cover.
