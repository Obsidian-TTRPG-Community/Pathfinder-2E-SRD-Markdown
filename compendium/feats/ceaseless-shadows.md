# Ceaseless Shadows  *Feat 13*  
[halfling](rules/traits/halfling.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Distracting Shadows](compendium/feats/distracting-shadows.md)

You excel at going unnoticed, especially among a crowd. You no longer need to have cover or be [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md). If you would have lesser cover from creatures, you gain cover and can [Take Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md), and if you would have cover from creatures, you gain greater cover.
