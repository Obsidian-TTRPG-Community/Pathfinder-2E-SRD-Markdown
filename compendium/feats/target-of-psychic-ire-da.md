# Target of Psychic Ire  *Feat 16*  
[amp](rules/traits/amp-da.md)  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  [occult](rules/traits/occult.md)  [psychic](rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  


Your magic saturates your surroundings with hateful psychic energy. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry. The cantrip must be one that takes 2 or more actions to cast and targets a creature.
