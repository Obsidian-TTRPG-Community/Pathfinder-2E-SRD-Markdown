# Ironblood Surge  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ironblood Stance](compendium/feats/ironblood-stance.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in Ironblood Stance.
- **Activity** Single Action

You steel yourself, preparing to resist oncoming attacks and using your muscles to absorb the impact. You gain the benefits of your iron sweep's [parry](rules/traits/parry.md "Parry Weapon Trait") trait (a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn) and your resistance from Ironblood Stance increases to your Strength modifier (if it's higher) for the same duration.
