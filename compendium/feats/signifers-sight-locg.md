# Signifer's Sight  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hellknight Signifer Dedication](compendium/feats/hellknight-signifer-dedication-locg.md)

The magic flowing through your signifer's mask allows you to see in the dark, and the mask dampens the distraction caused by sudden flashes of bright light. While wearing your signifer's mask, you gain [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md). Additionally, if you are [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) while wearing your signifer's mask and the target is [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) only because you are [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled), you reduce the flat check DC to target that creature from 5 to 3.
