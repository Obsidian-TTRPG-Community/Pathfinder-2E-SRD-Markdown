# Twin Weakness  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[esoterica](rules/traits/esoterica-da.md "Esoterica Action & Ability Trait")  [thaumaturge](rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md "Thaumaturge Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: mortal weakness or personal antithesis
- **Requirements**: You're holding an implement and a weapon, you are using [Exploit Vulnerability](rules/actions/exploit-vulnerability-da.md) with mortal weakness or personal antithesis, and the target creature is within reach of both your implement and weapon.
- **Activity** Two-Action

As you make an attack augmented by your esoterica, you also press your implement against the creature, applying its weakness as your implement's energies sear the creature's flesh. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the target of your [Exploit Vulnerability](rules/actions/exploit-vulnerability-da.md). On any attack roll result but a critical failure, you also press your implement against the creature, automatically dealing the additional damage from [Exploit Vulnerability](rules/actions/exploit-vulnerability-da.md). This is in addition to any damage from your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), including the weakness the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) applies from [Exploit Vulnerability](rules/actions/exploit-vulnerability-da.md). This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty.
