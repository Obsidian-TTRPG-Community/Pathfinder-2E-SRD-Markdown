# Psychic Duelist Dedication  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), you have been in a psychic duel

Through experience and in-depth visualizations of mental battles, you've grown adept at psychic duels. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your initiative rolls for psychic duels. Each time you enter a psychic duel, choose one of the following benefits for the duration of that duel.

- Mind Mace You gain a status bonus to mental damage with spells you cast equal to the spell's level.
- Psychic Fist You can use your standard ability modifier for [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) damage instead of your highest mental modifier, and you can use your full AC instead of using your Will DC in place of your AC.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the psychic duelist archetype.

## Psychic Duelist Dedication leads to...

[Duel Spell Advantage](compendium/feats/duel-spell-advantage-da.md), [Supreme Psychic Center](compendium/feats/supreme-psychic-center-da.md), [Instigate Psychic Duel](compendium/feats/instigate-psychic-duel-da.md)
