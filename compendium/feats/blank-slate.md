# Blank Slate  *Feat 16*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception)

Your deceptions confound even the most powerful mortal divinations. [Detection](rules/traits/detection.md "Detection Effect Trait"), [revelation](rules/traits/revelation.md "Revelation Effect Trait"), and [scrying](rules/traits/scrying.md "Scrying Effect Trait") effects pass right over you, your possessions, and your auras, detecting nothing unless the detecting effect has a counteract level of 10 or higher. For example, [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) would still detect other magic in the area but not any magic on you, [true seeing](compendium/spells/true-seeing.md) wouldn't reveal you, [locate](compendium/spells/locate.md) or [scrying](compendium/spells/scrying.md) wouldn't find you, and so on.
