# Gruesome Strike  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of evil, champion's reaction that grants extra damage with your [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md)
- **Requirements**: Your [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) currently deal extra damage from your champion's reaction.
- **Activity** Single Action

Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the creature that triggered your champion's reaction. If you hit, the target takes double the extra damage from your reaction and must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained).

Regardless of the result, the creature is temporarily immune to your Gruesome Strike for 24 hours.
