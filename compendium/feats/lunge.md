# Lunge  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a melee weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

Extending your body to its limits, you attack an enemy that would normally be beyond your reach. Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a melee weapon, increasing your reach by 5 feet for that [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). If the weapon has the [disarm](rules/traits/disarm.md "Disarm Weapon Trait"), [shove](rules/traits/shove.md "Shove Weapon Trait"), or [trip](rules/traits/trip.md "Trip Weapon Trait") trait, you can use the corresponding action instead of a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
