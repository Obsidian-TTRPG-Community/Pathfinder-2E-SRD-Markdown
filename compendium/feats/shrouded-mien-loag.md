[fetchling](rules/traits/fetchling-b2.md "Fetchling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You're used to dealing with dangerous situations and sinister creatures. You become trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) (or another skill of your choice, if you're already trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception)), and you gain the [Lengthy Diversion](compendium/feats/lengthy-diversion.md) skill feat as a bonus feat.
