# Educate Allies  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [bard](rules/traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Well-Versed](compendium/feats/well-versed-apg.md)
- **Trigger** An ally benefiting from one of your composition spells is subject to an effect with the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait"), [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait"), [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait"), [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait"), or [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") trait.
- **Activity** Reaction

You tweak the properties of your composition spell to convey a bit of your defensive knowledge. All allies affected by your composition spell gain your +1 circumstance bonus from Well-Versed until the start of your next turn. Teaching your allies also bolsters your own skills; your personal circumstance bonus from Well-Versed also increases to +2 until the start of your next turn.
