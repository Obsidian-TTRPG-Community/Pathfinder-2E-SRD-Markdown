# Lie Detector  *Feat 4*  
[investigator](rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: empiricism or interrogation methodology

You're adept at noticing the tells of a liarâ€”sweat, flushing, a quavering voice, a quickening pulse. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to [Sense Motive](rules/actions/sense-motive.md) and to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DCs against attempts to [Lie](rules/actions/lie.md) to you. When you determine someone is lying to you, you can use their deceit to your advantage to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the next [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), or [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check you attempt against that creature within the next minute.
