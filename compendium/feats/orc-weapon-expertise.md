[orc](rules/traits/orc.md "Orc Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Orc Weapon Familiarity](compendium/feats/orc-weapon-familiarity.md)

Your orc affinity blends with your class training, granting you great skill with orc weapons. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the [falchion](compendium/equipment/items/falchion.md), the [greataxe](compendium/equipment/items/greataxe.md), and all orc weapons in which you are trained.
