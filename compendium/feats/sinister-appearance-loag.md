# Sinister Appearance  *Feat 1*  
[ifrit](rules/traits/ifrit-b2.md)  


You possess horns, a tail, or red eyes, or could otherwise be mistaken for a tiefling.

You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation). If you would automatically become trained in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [Intimidating Glare](compendium/feats/intimidating-glare.md) skill feat, as well as a +2 circumstance bonus on [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) when pretending to be a version of yourself who is a tiefling.
