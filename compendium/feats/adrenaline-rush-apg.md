While you are [raging](rules/actions/rage.md), increase your [encumbered](rules/conditions.md#Encumbered) and maximum Bulk limits by 2; you also gain a +1 status bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to lift heavy objects, [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md), and [Force Open](rules/actions/force-open.md).
