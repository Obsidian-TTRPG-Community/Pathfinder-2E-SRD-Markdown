# Legendary Performer  *Feat 15*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance), [Virtuosic Performer](compendium/feats/virtuosic-performer.md)

Your fame has spread throughout the lands. NPCs who succeed at a DC 10 [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) have heard of you and usually have an attitude toward you one step better than normal, depending on your reputation and the NPC's disposition. For instance, if you're well-known for cruel and demanding behavior, creatures might be intimidated by you, rather than be [friendly](rules/conditions.md#Friendly) toward you. When you [Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md) with [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance), you attract higher-level audiences than your location would allow, as audiences flock to see you. For instance, rulers and angels might travel to your small tower in the woods to hear you perform. Typically, this increases the audiences available by 2 levels or more, determined by the GM.
