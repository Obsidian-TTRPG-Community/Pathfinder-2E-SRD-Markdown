# Explosive Maneuver  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[inventor](rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md "Inventor Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: weapon innovation
- **Requirements**: Your last action was a successful [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe using your weapon innovation.
- **Activity** Single Action

Thanks to a hidden experimental feature you built into your weapon, your weapon explosively deploys levers, tangling hooks, or similar mechanisms to provide significant assistance when you perform a combat maneuver. When you use Explosive Maneuver, choose [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md), or [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md). Your weapon innovation must have a weapon trait that matches the action you chose (for instance, to choose [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), your weapon must have the [grapple](rules/traits/grapple.md "Grapple Weapon Trait") trait). You take the chosen action against the same foe as your previous successful [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), using the same multiple attack penalty as your previous successful [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). You still increase your multiple attack penalty after the [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md), or [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md), as normal.
