# Superior Bond  *Feat 14*  
[wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md "Wizard Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: arcane bond

When you draw upon your bonded item, you can leave a bit of energy within it for later use. You can use [Drain Bonded Item](rules/actions/drain-bonded-item.md) one additional time per day, but only to cast a spell 2 or more levels lower than your highest-level spell.
