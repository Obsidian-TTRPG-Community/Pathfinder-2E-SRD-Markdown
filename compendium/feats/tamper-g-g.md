# Tamper  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[inventor](rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md "Inventor Class Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You tamper with a foe's weapon or armor, using a free hand.

Choose either a weapon held by an enemy in your reach or a suit of armor worn by an enemy in your reach. Attempt a [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check against the enemy's Reflex DC.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Your tampering is incredibly effective. If you tampered with a weapon, the enemy takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls with that weapon. If you tampered with armor, the armor hampers the enemy's movement, making the enemy [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) and inflicting a –10-foot penalty to its Speeds. The effect lasts until the enemy Interacts to remove it, regardless of which one you used.
> - **Success** Your tampering is temporarily effective. As critical success, but the effect ends at the start of your next turn, even if the enemy doesn't [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to end it.
> - **Critical Failure** Your tampering backfires dramatically, creating a small explosion from your own tools or gear. You take fire damage equal to your level.
