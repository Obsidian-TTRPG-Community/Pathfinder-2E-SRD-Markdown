# Dance Of Thunder  [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 14*  
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow and are not [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued).
- **Activity** Three-Action

Your steps echo with the thunderous retort of exploding black powder as you dance a dance of death. Take any of the following actions you choose in any order: [Step](rules/actions/step.md), [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a target within your firearm's first range increment, and [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to reload. If you attempted a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) and it succeeded, you can repeat these three actions again in any order. If you attempted a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) in the second set and succeeded, you can repeat the actions one last time.

After using Dance of Thunder, you become [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) for 1 minute.
