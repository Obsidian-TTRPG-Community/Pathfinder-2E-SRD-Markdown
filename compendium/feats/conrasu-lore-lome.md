# Conrasu Lore  *Feat 1*  
[conrasu](rules/traits/conrasu-loag.md)  


You have learned about your history and your people from shapers. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) and [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Conrasu Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).
