# Eclectic Sword Mastery  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 13*  
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [tengu](rules/traits/tengu-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Eclectic Sword Training](compendium/feats/eclectic-sword-training-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You instinctively learn how to use a sword with just a few practice swings. You change one of the swords designated in your [Tengu Weapon Familiarity](compendium/feats/tengu-weapon-familiarity-apg.md) to a new one that you're wielding, provided the sword meets the specifications of [Tengu Weapon Familiarity](compendium/feats/tengu-weapon-familiarity-apg.md). You can [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to draw a sword as part of this activity, designating the sword as part of drawing it; disrupting that [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action prevents you from designating it as one of your swords. This designation lasts until your next daily preparations.
