# Auspicious Mount  *Feat 16*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: divine ally (steed), [Imposing Destrier](compendium/feats/imposing-destrier.md)

Guided by your ongoing care, your steed has developed incredible intelligence and skill. The mount you gained through the [divine ally](compendium/feats/divine-ally.md) class feature is now a specialized animal companion. You can select one of the usual specializations or the auspice specialization.

Auspice mounts gain the following benefits: Your companion is marked by your deity's religious symbol as a sacred creature of your deity. Its proficiency rank in [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) increases to expert, it can speak the language associated with your deity's servitors (Celestial for champions who follow the tenets of good), and its Intelligence modifier increases by 2 and its Wisdom modifier by 1.
