# Invincible Mutagen  *Feat 12*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md "Alchemist Class Trait")  


The fortifying additives you brew into your mutagens make your juggernaut form impervious. Whenever you're affected by a juggernaut mutagen, you gain resistance to all physical damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0).
