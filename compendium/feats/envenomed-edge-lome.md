# Envenomed Edge  *Feat 13*  
[grippli](rules/traits/grippli-b2.md "Grippli Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


With a combination of your poison glands and herbal concoctions, you can consistently deliver venomous attacks when you hit an enemy's weak points. When you critically hit using a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a weapon or unarmed attack and deal slashing or piercing damage with that [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), you deal an additional `1d4` [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to your target.
