# Effortless Reach  *Feat 18*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  


Focusing the powers of your ki to augment your blows, you stretch and lengthen your body in ways that defy logic.

Your unarmed attacks gain the [reach](rules/traits/reach.md "Reach Weapon Trait") trait.
