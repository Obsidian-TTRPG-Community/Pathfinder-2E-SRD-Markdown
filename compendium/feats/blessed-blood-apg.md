# Blessed Blood  *Feat 5*  
[aasimar](rules/traits/aasimar-apg.md "Aasimar Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your freshly spilled blood is sanctified, and ingesting it causes effects similar to those of [holy water](compendium/equipment/items/holy-water.md)

Whenever a fiend, undead, or creature with a weakness to good damage drinks your blood or deals piercing or slashing damage to you with jaws, fangs, or a similar attack, that creature takes `1d6` good damage. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) checks to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) holy water using your own blood as one of the ingredients.
