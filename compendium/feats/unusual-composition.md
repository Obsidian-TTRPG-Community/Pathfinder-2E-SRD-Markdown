# Unusual Composition  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Polymath muse
- **Activity** Single Action

You can translate the emotion and power of a composition to other mediums. If your next action is to cast a composition spell, you can use a different kind of performance than usual for the composition to change any of its somatic components to verbal components or vice versa. As usual for composition spells, this changes whether the composition is [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") or [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait").
