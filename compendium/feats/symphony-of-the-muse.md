# Symphony Of The Muse  *Feat 20*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Harmonize](compendium/feats/harmonize.md)

You are able to weave countless performances together into a solo symphony. You are no longer limited to a single composition each turn or a single composition at a time; when you use a new composition, all previous compositions' effects continue for their remaining duration.
