# Folk Dowsing  *Feat 3*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival)

You can find what you're looking for using a dowsing rod or pendulum. If you [Search](rules/actions/search.md) while wielding a dowsing rod or pendulum, in addition to the normal checks for [Searching](rules/actions/search.md), the GM rolls a secret [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) check for you to detect the largest source of water, oil, or another natural non-bodily fluid in the area. Even if the liquid is [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) from you—for example, if it stems from an underground spring or is piped through a wall—this technique points you in the right direction. The GM determines the DC, which is usually the trained simple DC with a hard or very hard adjustment if the source of water is small.

If you're an expert in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival), the GM also makes a [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) check for you to detect sizable deposits of metal, minerals, and nearby graves. The DC is usually the expert simple DC, with DC adjustments for smaller deposits.
