- **Prerequisites**: able to create or control undead; cleric with a negative font, oracle of bones, or necromancer wizard

Your presence has a bolstering effect on your undead minions. Undead creatures under your control and within a 30-foot emanation around you gain a +2 status bonus to saving throws to resist positive damage and to Will saving throws to resist effects that would make them [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled).

**Special.** This feat has the trait matching your spellcasting tradition.
