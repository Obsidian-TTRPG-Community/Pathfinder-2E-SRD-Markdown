# Undying Conviction  *Feat 4*  
[aura](rules/traits/aura.md "Aura Combat Trait")  [cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md "Oracle Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md "Wizard Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: able to create or control undead; cleric with a negative font, oracle of bones, or necromancer wizard

Your presence has a bolstering effect on your undead minions. Undead creatures under your control and within a 30-foot emanation around you gain a +2 status bonus to saving throws to resist positive damage and to Will saving throws to resist effects that would make them [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled).

**Special.** This feat has the trait matching your spellcasting tradition.
