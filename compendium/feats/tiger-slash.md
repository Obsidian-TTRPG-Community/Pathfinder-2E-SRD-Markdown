# Tiger Slash  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Tiger Stance](compendium/feats/tiger-stance.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in Tiger Stance.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You make a fierce swipe with both hands. Make a tiger claw [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). It deals two extra weapon damage dice (three extra dice if you're 14th level or higher), and you can push the target 5 feet away as if you had successfully Shoved them. If the attack is a critical success and deals damage, add your Strength modifier to the [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from your tiger claw.
