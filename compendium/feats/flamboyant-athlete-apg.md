# Flamboyant Athlete  *Feat 4*  
[swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics)

Your panache allows you to perform incredible feats: climbing, swimming, and leaping far beyond your normal capacity. While you have panache, you gain the following benefits.

- You gain climb and swim Speeds equal to half your land Speed.
- The DCs of your High Jumps and Long Jumps decrease by 10. This doesn't combine with other abilities that reduce those DCs.
- The distance you can move with a vertical [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) increases to 5 feet. Your distance for a horizontal [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) increases to 15 feet if your Speed is at least 15 feet, or to 20 feet if your Speed is at least 30 feet.
