- **Activity** Two-Action

A Tiny shape of flame appears, taking a form of your choiceâ€” such as a bird, an arrow, or a simple sphere. It Flies from you up to 30 feet in a path you choose. Each creature it passes through takes `1d6` fire damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. A creature attempts only one save, even if the flame passes through it multiple times. Level (+2) The damage increases by `1d6`.
