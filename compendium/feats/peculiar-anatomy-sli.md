# Peculiar Anatomy  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Disturbing Defense](compendium/feats/disturbing-defense-sli.md)

Your circulatory system contains viscous protoplasmic fluid instead of ordinary blood. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against disease and poison, and resistance to poison damage equal to half your level.

In addition, your resistance to precision damage from [Disturbing Defense](compendium/feats/disturbing-defense-sli.md) increases to an amount equal to 7 + your number of class feats from the oozemorph archetype, and the DC of your flat checks to recover from [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) is 8 rather than 13.
