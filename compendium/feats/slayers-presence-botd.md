# Slayer's Presence  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Frighten Undead](compendium/feats/frighten-undead-botd.md)

Your very presence strikes fear into the undead. When you use Slayer's Identification and succeed at your check, you can Frighten Undead as a free action, targeting the creature you identified. Any time you get a critical success to Frighten Undead, if the target's level is lower than yours, the target is [fleeing](rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) for 1 round.
