# Brutal Critical  *Feat 18*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  


Your critical hits are particularly devastating. On a critical hit with a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), add one extra damage die. This is in addition to any extra dice you gain if the weapon is [deadly](rules/traits/deadly.md "Deadly Weapon Trait") or [fatal](rules/traits/fatal.md "Fatal Weapon Trait"). The target also takes [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to two damage dice.
