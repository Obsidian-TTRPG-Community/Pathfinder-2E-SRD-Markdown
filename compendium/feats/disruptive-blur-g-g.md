# Disruptive Blur  *Feat 14*  
[gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: way of the drifter

You use cacophonous blasts from your gun or distracting shots from your crossbow to cause momentary diversions, letting you move about the battlefield with impunity.

After you make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a firearm or crossbow, creatures can't take reactions that would be triggered by your movement for the rest of your turn.
