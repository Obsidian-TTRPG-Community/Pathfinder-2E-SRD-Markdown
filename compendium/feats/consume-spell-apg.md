# Consume Spell  *Feat 14*  
[sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md "Sorcerer Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Counterspell

When you successfully Counterspell a spell of the tradition that matches your bloodline, you consume it, replenishing yourself with its energy. When you do, you are nourished as if you had eaten a meal and regain Hit Points equal to twice the level of the counteracted spell.
