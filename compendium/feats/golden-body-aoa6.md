# Golden Body  *Feat 20*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  


You perfect your body, refining the flex of every muscle and the bend of every joint to maximum efficiency. Your unarmed [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) gain the [deadly <d12>](rules/traits/deadly-d12.md "Deadly Weapon Trait") trait, and you have fast healing 20, causing you to regain 20 HP at the start of each of your turns provided you have at least 1 HP.
