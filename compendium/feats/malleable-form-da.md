# Malleable Form  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 13*  
[reflection](rules/traits/reflection-da.md "Reflection Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: ability to cast at least one [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait") spell
- **Requirements**: You're polymorphed by a spell that has multiple choices of battle form.
- **Activity** Single Action

You adroitly shift your form, taking on another appearance. Choose a different battle form of the polymorph spell affecting you, and change to that form instead of the current one. This destabilizes the spell's magic, reducing its duration by 1 round.

Use the level of the spell to determine the statistics, as normal.
