# Wolf Drag  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Wolf Stance](compendium/feats/wolf-stance.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in Wolf Stance.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You rip your enemy off their feet. Make a wolf jaw [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). Your wolf jaw gains the [fatal <d12>](rules/traits/fatal-d12.md "Fatal Weapon Trait") trait for this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), and if the attack succeeds, you knock the target [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
