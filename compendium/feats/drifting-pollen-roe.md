- **Activity** Single Action

A haze of pollen floats around you. A creature in your kinetic aura when you enter the stance, or who later enters the aura or ends its turn in the aura, attempts at a Fortitude save against your class DC. On a failure, it's [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) ([sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) on a critical failure) and [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until it's no longer [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened). A creature attempts this save no more than once per round and doesn't attempt a new save if already affected.
