# Jellyfish Stance  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You relax your posture and loosen your joints, allowing yourself to move with incredible fluidity. You can make stinging lash attacks that deal `1d8` slashing damage. These attacks are in the brawling, and have the finesse, nonlethal, [reach](rules/traits/reach.md "Reach Weapon Trait"), and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits.

While in Jellyfish Stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves and on checks to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) and [Squeeze](rules/actions/squeeze.md).
