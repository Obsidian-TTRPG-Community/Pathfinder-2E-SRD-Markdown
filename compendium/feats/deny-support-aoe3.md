[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: Help either the Washboard Dogs or the Diobel Sweepers destroy their rival

When you succeed or critically succeed at a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check to [Feint](rules/actions/feint.md) an opponent, that target can't flank with their allies until the beginning of your next turn.
