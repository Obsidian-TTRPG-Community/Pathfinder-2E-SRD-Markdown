# Fiendish Resistance  *Feat 5*  
[tiefling](rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md)  


Your connection to your fiendish forebears has granted you one of their resistances as well. Choose one of the following energy damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You gain resistance 5 to that damage type.

Though you can choose any of these, the damage type typically matches a fiend associated with your bloodline.

For instance, a [hellspawn](compendium/feats/hellspawn-apg.md) might choose resistance to fire, or a [pitborn](compendium/feats/pitborn-apg.md) with a vrock ancestor might choose resistance to electricity.
