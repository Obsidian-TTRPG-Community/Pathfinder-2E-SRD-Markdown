# Transposable Compliance  *Feat 5*  
[fleshwarp](rules/traits/fleshwarp-loag.md "Fleshwarp Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your protean vitality is fecund and many-succoring: your veins run with life-giving ichor that adapts to the blood and physiology of any body, and your skin molts on command, creating wound-stanching sheaths of tissue for yourself and others. You become trained in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine). If you were already trained in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can [Administer First Aid](rules/actions/administer-first-aid.md) without healer's tools by using your physiology instead, but you must take 1 damage to make the attempt. Similarly, you can [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md) without healer's tools but take `2d8` damage. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on all [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) checks to [Administer First Aid](rules/actions/administer-first-aid.md) and [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md) using your own physiology.
