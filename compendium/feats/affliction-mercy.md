# Affliction Mercy  *Feat 12*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mercy](compendium/feats/mercy.md)

The divine grace that flows through you grants reprieve from an affliction. When you use [Mercy](compendium/feats/mercy.md), you can instead attempt to counteract a [curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait"), [disease](rules/traits/disease.md "Disease Effect Trait"), or [poison](rules/traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait").
