# Assured Knowledge  *Feat 6*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: enigma muse

You can procure information with confidence. Whenever you [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) using any skill (including [Bardic Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore)), you can forgo rolling your check to instead receive a result of 10 + your proficiency bonus (don't apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers). As long as you are an expert in a skill, you meet the prerequisites for the [Automatic Knowledge](compendium/feats/automatic-knowledge.md) skill feat in that skill, even if you don't have [Assurance](compendium/feats/assurance.md) in that skill.

## Assured Knowledge leads to...

[Enigma's Knowledge](compendium/feats/enigmas-knowledge-apg.md)
