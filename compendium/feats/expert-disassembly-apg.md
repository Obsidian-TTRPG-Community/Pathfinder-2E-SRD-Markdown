# Expert Disassembly  *Feat 7*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting), [Scrounger Dedication](compendium/feats/scrounger-dedication-apg.md)

You can apply the same techniques you use to reverse engineer objects to disable them. You can use [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) instead of [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) to [Disable a Device](rules/actions/disable-a-device.md) or [Pick a Lock](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md).
