# Clone-Risen  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  [reflection](rules/traits/reflection-da.md "Reflection Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You were formed from a clone ritual or alchemical experiment. Created as a vessel for another creature, you can suppress your sentience momentarily, making your mind harder to alter. You gain the Empty Vessel reaction.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Empty Vessel** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md))

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger**: You would take mental damage or be affected by a [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect

**Effect** You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Will saves and resistance to mental damage equal to your level against the triggering effect. This applies only to the initial effect, not successive saves, [persistent mental damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), or other repeated effects.
