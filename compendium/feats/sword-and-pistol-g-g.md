# Sword And Pistol  *Feat 1*  
[gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  


You're comfortable wielding a firearm or crossbow in one hand and a melee weapon in the other, combining melee attacks with shots from the firearm. When you make a successful ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against an enemy within your reach with your one-handed firearm or one-handed crossbow, that enemy is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your next melee attack with a one-handed melee weapon.

When you make a successful melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against an enemy with your one-handed melee weapon, the next ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) you make against that enemy with a one-handed firearm or one-handed crossbow doesn't trigger reactions that would trigger on a ranged attack but not a melee attack, such as [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md). Either of these benefits is lost if not used by the end of your next turn.
