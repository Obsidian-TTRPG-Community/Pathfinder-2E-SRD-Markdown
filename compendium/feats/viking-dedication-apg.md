# Viking Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics)

Vikings spend long periods of time at sea, only to leap from their boats at a moment's notice, charge through the surf, and take their enemies by storm. You're trained in [Sailing Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore). When moving through water using your land Speed, you ignore difficult terrain resulting from shallow water, such as in bogs or on beaches. In addition, if you roll a success for your [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md), you get a critical success instead.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the viking archetype.

## Viking Dedication leads to...

[Hurling Charge](compendium/feats/hurling-charge-apg.md), [Second Shield](compendium/feats/second-shield-apg.md), [Viking Weapon Familiarity](compendium/feats/viking-weapon-familiarity-apg.md), [Viking Weapon Specialist](compendium/feats/viking-weapon-specialist-apg.md), [Viking Vindicator](compendium/feats/viking-vindicator-lokl.md)
