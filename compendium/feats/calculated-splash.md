# Calculated Splash  *Feat 4*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md "Alchemist Class Trait")  


You have calculated all the angles to maximize a bomb's splash. When you throw an alchemical bomb with the [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") trait, you can cause the bomb to deal splash damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) instead of the normal amount.

## Calculated Splash leads to...

[Expanded Splash](compendium/feats/expanded-splash.md), [Mega Bomb](compendium/feats/mega-bomb.md), Controlled Blast
