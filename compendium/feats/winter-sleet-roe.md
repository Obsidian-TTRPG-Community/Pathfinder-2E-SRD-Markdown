- **Activity** Single Action

Bone-chilling, swirling sleet surrounds you, cruel as deepest winter. Surfaces in your kinetic aura are coated in slippery ice. A creature that moves on this uneven ground immediately falls unless it Balances (DC 15). A creature is off-guard on the ice, as normal for uneven ground. You're immune to these effects.

If a creature on the ice is critically hit by one of your water impulses or critically fails at a save against one, that creature is [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) until the end of its next turn.
