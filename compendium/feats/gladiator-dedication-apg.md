# Gladiator Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Impressive Performance](compendium/feats/impressive-performance.md)

You know how to turn combat into a form of entertainment. You become trained in [Gladiatorial Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore); if already trained in [Gladiatorial Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), you instead become trained in another [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill of your choice.

At the start of a combat encounter, if you have spectators, you gain a number of temporary HP equal to your character level for 1 minute and you can roll [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) for your initiative.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the gladiator archetype.

## Gladiator Dedication leads to...

[Fancy Moves](compendium/feats/fancy-moves-apg.md), [Performative Weapons Training](compendium/feats/performative-weapons-training-apg.md), [Play To The Crowd](compendium/feats/play-to-the-crowd-apg.md), [Call Your Shot](compendium/feats/call-your-shot-apg.md), [Stage Fighting](compendium/feats/stage-fighting-apg.md)
