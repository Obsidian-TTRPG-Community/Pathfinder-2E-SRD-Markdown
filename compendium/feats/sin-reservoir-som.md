# Sin Reservoir  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Runelord Dedication](compendium/feats/runelord-dedication-som.md)

During daily preparations, you can indulge in your associated sin. When you do, you gain one additional spell slot of any spell level up to two levels below the highest-level wizard spell you can cast. You can prepare only a spell of your specialized school in this slot. As with any other act, indulging in your sin might change your alignment if your behavior harms someone else.
