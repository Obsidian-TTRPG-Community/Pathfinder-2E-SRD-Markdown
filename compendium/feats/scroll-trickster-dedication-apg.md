# Scroll Trickster Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion)

You've studied scrolls in depth. This might have been a comprehensive education in formal setting, or the sort of education where you somehow obtain a number of scrolls and try not to explode anything you didn't mean to explode. You gain the [Trick Magic Item](compendium/feats/trick-magic-item.md) feat, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to Trick scrolls. If you roll a critical failure to [Trick a Magic Item](compendium/feats/trick-magic-item.md) that's a scroll, you get a failure instead.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the scroll trickster archetype.

## Scroll Trickster Dedication leads to...
