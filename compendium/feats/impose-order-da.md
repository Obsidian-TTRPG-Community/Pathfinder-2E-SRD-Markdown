- **Requirements**: precise discipline subconscious mind
- **Activity** Single Action

You bring discipline to your mind and magic, ensuring that you don't under-perform. Until the end of your turn, instead of rolling dice for damage, count each damage die as average damage rounded up (3 for d4, 4 for d6, 5 for d8, 6 for d10, and 7 for d12).
