# Moldersoul  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  ardande  


Your connection to elemental wood asserts itself in the form of decay, like forgotten logs left to rot and the char that remains after a forest fire, cycles of devastation clearing away what was to make room for the next generation of life. You gain the Decompose action.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Decompose** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") ([primal](rules/traits/primal.md), void)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** Void energy seeps out of you, decaying everything within a 5-foot emanation and causing plants and foliage to age and decompose. Natural difficult terrain is destroyed, and creatures in the area with the plant or wood trait take `1d6` void damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
