# Eldritch Calm  *Feat 13*  
[rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Fey Influence](compendium/feats/fey-influence-loil.md)

Your fey heritage has altered your mindset to more resemble the uncanny perspective of the fey. While you are not emotionless, and indeed might be [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) to fits of odd moods and tempers, many perceive you as having an aura of unshakable tranquility. When you roll a critical failure against an [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") or [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effect, you get a failure instead. Once per day in place of attempting a saving throw against an [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") or [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effect, you can automatically treat your result as though you had rolled a 20; this is a [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait") effect.

However, your extraordinary emotional detachment makes it difficult to encourage you. You reduce any bonus you gain from an [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effect by 1.

**Special.** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for human, goblin for goblin, etc.).
