# Attack Of Opportunity (Swashbuckler)  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md "Swashbuckler Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") action or a [move](rules/traits/move.md "Move Combat Trait") action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.
- **Activity** Reaction

You swat a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action.

This [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
