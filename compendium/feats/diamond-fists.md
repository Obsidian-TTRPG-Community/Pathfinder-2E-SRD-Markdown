# Diamond Fists  *Feat 18*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  


Your body hardens as you combine your attacks, making your finishing blows more damaging. Your unarmed attacks gain the [forceful](rules/traits/forceful.md) trait. Any that already had this trait instead increase their weapon damage dice by one step.
