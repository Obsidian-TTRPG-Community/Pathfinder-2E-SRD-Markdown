# Versatile Spellstrike  *Feat 18*  
[magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md "Magus Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md)

You can channel the entire realm of possibilities of your spellbook into an attack. Once during your daily preparations, you can use a spell slot to hold that infinite potential, rather than using it to prepare a spell. When you make a [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md), you can expend this special spell slot to immediately prepare and cast a spell from your spellbook at 2 levels lower than the slot's level. (As normal for preparing spells, you can use a spell of an even-lower level, heightening it accordingly.) You don't have any spell prepared in that slot until you cast from that slot.
