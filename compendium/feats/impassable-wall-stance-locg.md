- **Prerequisites**: [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md)

You refuse to let foes past your guard. As long as you are in this stance, when you critically hit with an [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md) triggered by a move action, you disrupt that move action.
