# Conceited Mindset  *Feat 2*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of evil

Because you know your mind is superior, you scoff at anyone who would alter your mental stateâ€”but this hubris gets the better of you when you're wrong. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effects. If you succeed at a save against a [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect, you critically succeed instead; similarly, if you fail at a save against a [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect, you critically fail instead.
