# Hit The Dirt!  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** A creature you can see attempts a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against you.
- **Activity** Reaction

You fling yourself out of harm's way. You [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md). Your movement gives you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. Regardless of whether or not the triggering attack hits, you land [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) after completing your [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md).
