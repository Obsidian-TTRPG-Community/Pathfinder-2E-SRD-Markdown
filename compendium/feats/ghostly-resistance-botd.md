# Ghostly Resistance  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghost Dedication](compendium/feats/ghost-dedication-botd.md)

Your ghostly form becomes innately weaker but also gains resistance to many forms of damage. Your maximum HP is reduced by your level. You gain resistance 1 to all damage except for force, positive, and any damage done by a weapon with the [ghost touch](compendium/equipment/items/ghost-touch.md) rune (or any other source that acts like a [ghost touch](compendium/equipment/items/ghost-touch.md) rune). This resistance increases to 2 if the source is non-magical.

At 10th level, the resistance increases to 2, or 4 if the source is non-magical. At 16th level, the resistance increases to 3, or 5 if the source is non-magical.
