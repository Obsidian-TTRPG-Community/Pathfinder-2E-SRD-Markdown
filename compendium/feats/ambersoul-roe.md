# Ambersoul  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  ardande  


Your elemental heritage is reflected in the oils and fragrances of plants, in tree resin that fossilizes into amber, or in the gentle smell of a flower. Sticky, golden sap runs through your veins instead of blood. Each time a creature deals slashing or piercing damage to you with a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), your sap coats its weapon or unarmed attack.

The creature takes a â€“1 circumstance penalty on attack rolls with that weapon or unarmed attack until the end of its turn.
