# Shaitan Skin  *Feat 13*  
[oread](rules/traits/oread-b2.md "Oread Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


When in danger, you can harden the stone in your skin into armor, much like a shaitan. You can cast [stoneskin](compendium/spells/stoneskin.md) on yourself only, 3 times per day as a 4th-level arcane innate spell.
