# Anticipate Ambush  *Feat 6*  
[exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md)  [rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth)

Using your extensive knowledge of ambush tactics, you keep watch for any [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) creatures or dangerous sites, moving at half your travel speed. If you're Anticipating an Ambush at the start of an encounter, you roll a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check for initiative, and all enemies rolling [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) for initiative take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to their [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks.
