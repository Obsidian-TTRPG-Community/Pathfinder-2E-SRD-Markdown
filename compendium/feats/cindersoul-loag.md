# Cindersoul  *Feat 1*  
[ifrit](rules/traits/ifrit-b2.md "Ifrit Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  


The fire of your elemental ancestor manifests like [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) embers of a blaze, and your inner charcoal helps staunch bleeding, purify simple poisons, and absorb acid. The DC for you to recover from [persistent acid](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), bleed, and poison damage is 10 instead of 15 (or 5 if you have particularly effective assistance).
