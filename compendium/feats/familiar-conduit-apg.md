[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Familiar Master Dedication](compendium/feats/familiar-master-dedication-apg.md), able to cast spells
- **Requirements**: You have line of effect to your familiar.
- **Activity** Single Action

Under your tutelage, your familiar has grown attuned to the hidden currents of the world and can serve as a conduit for your magic. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that has a range, the spell uses the familiar as its origin point.
