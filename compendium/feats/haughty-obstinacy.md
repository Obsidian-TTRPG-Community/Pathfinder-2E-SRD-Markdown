# Haughty Obstinacy  *Feat 1*  
[human](rules/traits/human.md "Human Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your powerful ego makes it harder for others to order you around. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect that attempts to directly control your actions, you critically succeed instead. If a creature rolls a failure on a check to [Coerce](rules/actions/coerce.md) you using [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), it gets a critical failure instead (so it can't try to [Coerce](rules/actions/coerce.md) you again for 1 week).
