# Mirror-Risen  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  [reflection](rules/traits/reflection-da.md "Reflection Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You were created from magic involving mirrors and still retain some ability to seek refuge in reflected illusions. You gain the Mirror's Trickery reaction.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Mirror's Trickery** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md), [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md), [visual](rules/traits/visual.md))

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger**: You would be hit by a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)

**Effect** You create an illusory duplicate at the last instant and attempt to trick your foe into striking it instead of you. The attacker attempts a DC 11 flat check; on a failure, the attack hits the duplicate, changing the result from a critical success to a success or a success to a failure.
