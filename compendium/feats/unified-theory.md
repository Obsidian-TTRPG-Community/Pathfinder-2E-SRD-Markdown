# Unified Theory  *Feat 15*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana)

You've started to make a meaningful connection about the common underpinnings of the four traditions of magic and magical essences, allowing you to understand them all through an arcane lens. Whenever you use a skill action or a skill feat that requires a [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) check, depending on the magic tradition, you can use [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) instead. If you would normally take a penalty or have a higher DC for using [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) on other magic (such as when using [Identify Magic](rules/actions/identify-magic.md)), you no longer do so.
