[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md)  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md)  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md)  [vigilante](rules/traits/vigilante-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vigilante Dedication](compendium/feats/vigilante-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You are completely [unnoticed](rules/conditions.md#Unnoticed) by the target creature.
- **Activity** Single Action

You can startle foes who are unaware of your presence.

Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against your target. That creature is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), as normal. If your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) hits, the target remains [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) for the rest of your turn and is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) ([frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical hit).
