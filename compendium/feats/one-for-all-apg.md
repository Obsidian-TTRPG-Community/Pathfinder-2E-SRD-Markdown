# One For All  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md)  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md)  [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md)  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md)  [swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy)
- **Activity** Single Action

With precisely the right words of encouragement, you bolster an ally's efforts. Designate an ally within 30 feet; this action counts as sufficient preparation to [Aid](rules/actions/aid.md) that ally. When you use the [Aid](rules/actions/aid.md) reaction to help that ally, you can roll [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) in place of the usual check. If your swashbuckler's style is wit and your [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check to [Aid](rules/actions/aid.md) meets or exceeds the very hard DC for your level, you gain panache.
