# Annihilating Swing  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 20*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You have learned from the brute destructive power of xulgaths and their kind. You make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that ignores any resistances the target has. If you target a solid unattended object or surface with your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), you might automatically destroy it without an attack roll. If you target any object or surface with Hardness 20 or less that isn't a magic item or the effect of a spell, you destroy it. If the target object or surface is a magic item or the effect of a spell, you attempt to counteract it using your attack bonus with the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) for the counteract check. On a successful counteract check, you destroy the object or surface unless it has Hardness greater than 20, is an artifact, or is similarly difficult to destroy. You destroy up to a 5-foot cube of an object or surface larger than Medium.
