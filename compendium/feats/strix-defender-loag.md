# Strix Defender  *Feat 1*  
[strix](rules/traits/strix-loag.md)  


Your ancestral feud with humans gives you experience dealing with vicious foes, and your vengeance knows no bounds. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception), and [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) checks against humans, as well as on damage rolls against humans with weapons and unarmed attacks.

However, your hatred of humans is immediately obvious, giving you a â€“2 circumstance penalty to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks against them and usually starting their attitude one step worse towards you.
