# Hefting Shadow  *Feat 9*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [fetchling](rules/traits/fetchling-b2.md "Fetchling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")  [shadow](rules/traits/shadow.md "Shadow General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Clever Shadow](compendium/feats/clever-shadow-loag.md)

Your shadow can contain objects. You can [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) with your shadow to store or retrieve objects, just like you would a mundane container (meaning you spend two [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions total to store and then retrieve the object, for example). Your shadow can contain 2 Bulk of objects, which don't count toward the Bulk you're carrying. The items remain solid but take on a shadowy patina while stored this way. Though the items are in your shadow and can be detected normally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks to Conceal the Objects unless someone knows to check your shadow for items.
