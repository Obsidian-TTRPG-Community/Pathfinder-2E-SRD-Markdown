# Visual Fidelity  *Feat 6*  
[inventor](rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md "Inventor Class Trait")  


You've found a way to use a hodgepodge combination of devices to enhance your visual abilities in every situation. You gain [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md) and [low-light vision](rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md), and you can see [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creatures and objects as translucent shapes, though these shapes are indistinct enough to be [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to you.

If an effect would give you the [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) condition, the effect must attempt a counteract check against your class DC, with your counteract level equaling half your level, rounded up. On a failed counteract check, you aren't [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded)â€”your various devices are able to compensate.
