# Resounding Cascade  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 16*  
[magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md "Magus Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md)
- **Trigger** You use [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md).
- **Activity** Free Action

When you enter your [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md), you disperse the magical reinforcement to nearby allies. You grant the extra damage of [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md) in an aura affecting all allies in a 5-foot emanation. This uses only the base damage of the stance, based on the ally's weapon specialization; it doesn't use any increase you get from bonuses, the laughing shadow hybrid study, or the like. As normal for duplicate effects, multiple Arcane Cascades affecting the same creature aren't cumulative.
