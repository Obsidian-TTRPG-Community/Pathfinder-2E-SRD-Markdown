# Warning Shot  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation)
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm.
- **Activity** Single Action

Who needs words when the roar of a gun is so much more succinct? You attempt to [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) a foe by firing your weapon into the air, using the firearm's maximum range rather than the usual range of 30 feet. This check doesn't take the â€“4 circumstance penalty if the target doesn't share a language with you.
