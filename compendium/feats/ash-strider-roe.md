- **Activity** Two-Action

You discorporate into a cloud of whirling ash and [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md). If you have a fly Speed, you can [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md) instead. This movement doesn't trigger reactions, you can move through occupied spaces and tiny cracks, and you ignore any difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain that wouldn't impede smoke. The first creature you pass through during this movement takes `3d6` fire damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. Ash lingers around you after your movement is complete, granting you concealment until the start of your next turn.
