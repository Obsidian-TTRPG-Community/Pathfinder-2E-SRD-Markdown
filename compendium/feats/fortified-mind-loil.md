# Fortified Mind  *Feat 9*  
[kashrishi](rules/traits/kashrishi-loil.md)

When you would gain the [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) or [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) condition, you can attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, you don't gain the [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) or [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) condition.
