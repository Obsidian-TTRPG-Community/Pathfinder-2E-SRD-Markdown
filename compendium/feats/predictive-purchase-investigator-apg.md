# Predictive Purchase (Investigator)  *Feat 6*  
[investigator](rules/traits/investigator-apg.md "Investigator Class Trait")  


You have just the thing for the situation. You gain the [Prescient Planner](compendium/feats/prescient-planner-apg.md) and [Prescient Consumable](compendium/feats/prescient-consumable-apg.md) feats. When using [Prescient Planner](compendium/feats/prescient-planner-apg.md), you can pull out the item as a 2-action activity to remove your backpack (or a similar container) and draw the item, rather than taking 1 minute.
