# Shepherd of Desolation  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [aura](rules/traits/aura.md "Aura Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Reclaimant Dedication](compendium/feats/knight-reclaimant-dedication-locg.md), [Survivor of Desolation](compendium/feats/survivor-of-desolation-locg.md)

You know how to keep others alive in the Gravelands' murkiest shadows. Allies within 10 feet of you gain the benefit of Survivor of Desolation. If you are a champion, this aura is a champion aura, even though you gained it from Knight Reclaimant instead of a champion feat or feature.
