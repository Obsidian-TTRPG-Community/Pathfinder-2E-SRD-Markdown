# Fey Caller  *Feat 8*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  


You have learned some of the tricks the fey use to bend primal magic toward illusions and trickery. Add [illusory disguise](compendium/spells/illusory-disguise.md), [illusory object](compendium/spells/illusory-object.md), [illusory scene](compendium/spells/illusory-scene.md), and [veil](compendium/spells/veil.md) to your spell list as primal spells.
