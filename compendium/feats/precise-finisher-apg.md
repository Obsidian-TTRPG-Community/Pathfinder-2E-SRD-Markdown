# Precise Finisher  *Feat 6*  
[swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Confident Finisher](rules/actions/confident-finisher-apg.md)

Even when your foe avoids your [Confident Finisher](rules/actions/confident-finisher-apg.md), you can still hit a vital spot. On a failure with [Confident Finisher](rules/actions/confident-finisher-apg.md), you apply your full precise strike damage instead of half.
