# Advanced Elemental Spell  *Feat 6*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: flame order, stone order, storm order, or wave order

Your connection to one of the great elemental aspects of nature deepens, allowing you further control over its powers. You gain the advanced order spell associated with your order: if you're a member of the flame order, you gain [combustion](compendium/spells/combustion-som.md); if you're a member of the stone order, you gain [stone lance](compendium/spells/stone-lance-som.md); if you're a member of the storm order, you gain [powerful inhalation](compendium/spells/powerful-inhalation-som.md); if you're a member of the wave order, you gain [pulverizing cascade](compendium/spells/pulverizing-cascade-som.md). Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
