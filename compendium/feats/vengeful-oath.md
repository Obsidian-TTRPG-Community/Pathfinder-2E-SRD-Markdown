# Vengeful Oath  *Feat 2*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  [oath](rules/traits/oath.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Paladin cause

You've sworn an oath to hunt down wicked evildoers and bring them to judgment. Add the following tenet to your code after the others: "You must hunt down and exterminate evil creatures that have committed heinous atrocities as long as you have a reasonable chance of success and aren't engaged in a mission that would prevent your doing so."

You can use [lay on hands](compendium/spells/lay-on-hands.md) to damage a creature you witness harming an innocent or a good ally as if it were undead; in this case, lay on hands deals good damage instead of positive damage and gains the [good](rules/traits/good.md) trait. This good damage can affect non-evil creatures. This doesn't prevent you from healing such a creature with lay on hands; you choose whether to heal or harm.

## Vengeful Oath leads to...

[Aura Of Vengeance](compendium/feats/aura-of-vengeance.md)
