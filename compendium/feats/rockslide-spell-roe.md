# Rockslide Spell  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait")  [spellshape](rules/traits/spellshape-roe.md "Spellshape General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Elementalist Dedication](compendium/feats/elementalist-dedication-roe.md), earth is in your elemental philosophy
- **Activity** Single Action

You enhance your spell with elemental earth, causing chunks of stone to litter the ground. If the next action you use is to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that affects an area, a number of 5-foot squares in the area equal to the spell rank become difficult terrain for 1 round. These squares must be on the ground, and the entire area of difficult terrain must be contiguous. The spell gains the [earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait") trait.
