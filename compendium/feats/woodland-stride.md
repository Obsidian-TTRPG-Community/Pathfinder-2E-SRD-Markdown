# Woodland Stride  *Feat 4*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Leaf order

You can always find a path, almost as if foliage parted before you. You ignore any difficult terrain caused by plants or fungus, such as bushes, vines, and undergrowth. Even plants manipulated by magic don't impede your progress.
