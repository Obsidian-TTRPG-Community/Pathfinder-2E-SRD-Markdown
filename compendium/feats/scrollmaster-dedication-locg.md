# Scrollmaster Dedication  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in any [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill, member of the Pathfinder Society affiliated with the School of Scrolls

Your experience chronicling adventures and discoveries grants you heightened discernment and memory. For 24 hours after learning a prominent fact—such as the name of an NPC you have met, the details of your mission briefing, and similar information—you can recall it without attempting a check, though this doesn't allow you to automatically memorize long strings of numbers or text. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to remember a detail that has come up before in the current adventure, even if it was more than 24 hours ago.

If you have the [Thorough Reports](compendium/feats/thorough-reports-lowg.md) feat and have expert proficiency in the skill you're using to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), your circumstance bonus to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about creatures from that feat increases to +4.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Scrollmaster archetype.

## Scrollmaster Dedication leads to...
