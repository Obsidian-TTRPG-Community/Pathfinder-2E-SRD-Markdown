# Tail Spin  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 5*  
[goblin](rules/traits/goblin.md "Goblin Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: tailed goblin heritage, [Hard Tail](compendium/feats/hard-tail-locg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You excel at using your tail as a weapon to upend your foes.

Attempt a single [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) up to two adjacent creatures. If you roll a success against a target, you get a critical success against that target instead.
