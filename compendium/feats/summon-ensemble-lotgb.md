# Summon Ensemble  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](compendium/feats/spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [summon instrument](compendium/spells/summon-instrument-apg.md)

When you cast [summon instrument](compendium/spells/summon-instrument-apg.md), you can modify its duration to be sustained, up to 1 minute. When you do, you summon a number of instruments equal to your spellcasting ability modifier that hover around you and play of their own accord. Once per turn when you [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), choose an opponent within 30 feet who can hear your performance.

The target must attempt a Will save against the spell's DC; on a failure, it becomes distracted by your performance and becomes [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) for 1 round. The target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.
