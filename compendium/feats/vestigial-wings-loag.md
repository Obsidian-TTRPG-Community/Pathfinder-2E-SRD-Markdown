[ganzi](rules/traits/ganzi-loag.md "Ganzi Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You possess small, weak wings that aid in balance. You gain the [Steady Balance](compendium/feats/steady-balance.md) and [Cat Fall](compendium/feats/cat-fall.md) skill feats as bonus feats, even if you aren't trained in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics).
