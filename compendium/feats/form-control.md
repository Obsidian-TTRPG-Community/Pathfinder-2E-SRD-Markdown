# Form Control  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Strength 14, [Wild Shape](compendium/feats/wild-shape.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

With additional care and effort, you can take on an alternate form for a longer period of time. If your next action is to cast [wild shape](compendium/spells/wild-shape.md), wild shape's spell level is 2 lower than normal (minimum 1st level), but you can remain transformed for up to 1 hour or the listed duration (whichever is longer). You can still [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the form at any time, as permitted by the spell.

## Form Control leads to...

[Perfect Form Control](compendium/feats/perfect-form-control.md)
