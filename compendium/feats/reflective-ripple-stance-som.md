You enter a stance of fluid grace as small amounts of water flow with your movements and attacks. You can make flowing wave attacks that deal `1d6` bludgeoning damage.

They are in the brawling group and have the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait"), [disarm](rules/traits/disarm.md "Disarm Weapon Trait"), [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait"), [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait"), [trip](rules/traits/trip.md "Trip Weapon Trait"), [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait"), and [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") traits.
