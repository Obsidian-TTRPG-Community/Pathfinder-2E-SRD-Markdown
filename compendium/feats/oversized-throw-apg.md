# Oversized Throw  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Requirements**: You have one or more hands free.
- **Activity** Two-Action

With a great heave, you seize a piece of your surroundings, such as a boulder, log, table, wagon, or chunk of earth, and hurl it at your foes. The object must be your size or one size smaller than you, and it must not have too much Bulk for you to lift it in the first place. Make a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the object; regardless of the result, the object takes the same amount of damage it would deal on a success. The object is a simple ranged weapon that deals `1d10` bludgeoning damage, has a range increment of 20 feet, and has the thrown weapon trait. The damage increases to `2d10` if you have weapon specialization in simple weapons, or `3d10` if you have greater weapon specialization.
