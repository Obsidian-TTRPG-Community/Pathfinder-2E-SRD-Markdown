# Rope Mastery  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Golden League Xun Dedication](compendium/feats/golden-league-xun-dedication-frp2.md), expert in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics)

Ropes are your tool of choice, and you deploy them in versatile ways. When Climbing a rope, you move 5 more feet on a success and 10 more feet on a critical success, to a maximum of your Speed. This additional movement stacks with the effects of [Quick Climb](compendium/feats/quick-climb.md).

In addition, you can use a rope to hamper your foes. When holding a rope, you can attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md), [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), or [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) a creature up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. If you critically fail such a check while holding a rope, you can drop the rope to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.
