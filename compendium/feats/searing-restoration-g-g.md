# Searing Restoration  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [healing](rules/traits/healing.md "Healing Effect Trait")  [inventor](rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md "Inventor Class Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [unstable](rules/traits/unstable-g-g.md "Unstable  Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

They told you there was no way that explosions could heal people, but they were fools... Fools who didn't understand your brilliance! You create a minor explosion from your innovation, altering the combustion to cauterize wounds using vaporized medicinal herbs. You or a living creature adjacent to you regains `1d10` Hit Points. In addition, the creature you heal can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.

At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, increase the healing by `1d10`.

**Special.** If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you, though because it's not a living creature, it can't use the ability on itself.
