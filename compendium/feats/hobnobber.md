# Hobnobber  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy)

You are skilled at learning information through conversation. The [Gather Information](rules/actions/gather-information.md) exploration activity takes you half as long as normal (typically reducing the time to 1 hour). If you're a master in [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) and you [Gather Information](rules/actions/gather-information.md) at the normal speed, when you attempt to do so and roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. There is still no guarantee that a rumor you learn with [Gather Information](rules/actions/gather-information.md) is accurate.

## Hobnobber leads to...

[Entourage](compendium/feats/entourage-locg.md)
