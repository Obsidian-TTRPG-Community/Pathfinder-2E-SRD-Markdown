# Analyze Weakness  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: sneak attack `2d6`
- **Requirements**: You must have identified a creature with [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md).
- **Activity** Single Action

Your knowledge of a creature's physiology and understanding of tactics helps you attack with pinpoint accuracy. You carefully study a creature that you've identified to scope out particularly weak points in its positioning or physical form.

The next time you deal sneak attack damage to the chosen creature with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) before the end of your turn, add an additional `2d6` precision damage. At 11th and 17th levels, if your additional damage from sneak attack increases, increase the additional damage from Analyze Weakness to `3d6` at 11th level and `4d6` at 17th level.
