# Explosive Entry  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 7*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Demolitionist Dedication](compendium/feats/demolitionist-dedication-g-g.md), master in [Engineering Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You know exactly how to make a memorable entrance... by detonating a bomb to produce a devastating explosion, of course! You Set Explosives on a door, window, container, or heavy gate. When the explosives detonate, you can attempt an [Engineering Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check to [Force Open](rules/actions/force-open.md) the target. If a bomb would add an item bonus to attack rolls, add that item bonus to your [Engineering Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check. Since you're blasting your way in, you can't avoid breaking the object or structure. If you roll a critical success, you get a success instead.
