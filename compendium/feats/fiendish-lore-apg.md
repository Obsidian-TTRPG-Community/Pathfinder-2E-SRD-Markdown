# Fiendish Lore  *Feat 1*  
[tiefling](rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md "Tiefling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You were raised by a tiefling or a fiendish relative, or you've devoted yourself to researching the secrets of the fiendish realms. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) and [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also become trained in a [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill related to the fiendish plane from which you trace your lineage (usually [Abaddon Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), [Abyss Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), or [Hell Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore)).
