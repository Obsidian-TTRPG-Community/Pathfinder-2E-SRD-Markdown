# Elemental Fist  *Feat 2*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ki Strike](compendium/feats/ki-strike.md)

You call upon the power of the elements, infusing your ki with elemental energy and allowing your attacks to deal energy damage. When you cast [ki strike](compendium/spells/ki-strike.md), in addition to the damage types normally available, you can deliver the extra damage in the form of a gust of storm-tossed wind (dealing electricity damage and gaining the [air](rules/traits/air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait") trait), a chunk of stone (dealing bludgeoning damage and gaining the [earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait") trait), a flickering flame (dealing fire damage), or a crashing wave of frigid water (dealing cold damage and gaining the [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") trait).
