# Pact of Draconic Fury  *Feat 6*  
[arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait")  [archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pactbinder Dedication](compendium/feats/pactbinder-dedication-da.md)

You've sworn a pact with a dragon, giving you the ability to tap into the dragon's immeasurable power in exchange for adding to their hoard. You gain the Dragon Breath activity. In exchange, you promise to search for objects the dragon wants for its hoard upon request. These requests might be extremely specific unique objects, or they might be a broad category of objects. While the dragon agrees to pay you a fair price for the item you retrieve, the pact requires you to give your time and service.

title: **Dragon Breath** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** You breathe deeply and exhale a line or cone of powerful breath, much like the dragon with which you made the pact. If the dragon had a cone-shaped breath weapon, your breath weapon is a 30-foot cone. If they had a line-shaped breath weapon, your breath weapon is a 60-foot line. If they had a burst-shaped breath weapon, your breath weapon is a 10-foot burst within 60 feet. No matter the shape, it deals `1d6` damage per level, of the same damage type as the dragon's Breath Weapon, with a basic Reflex save, using the higher of your class DC or spell DC. This action has the same traits as the breath weapon of the dragon you made the pact with.
