# Bone Spikes  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[deviant](rules/traits/deviant-da.md)  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

Sharp shards of bone tear forth from your elbows, wrists, or other parts of your body. For 1 minute, you can make bone spike unarmed [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), which deal `1d6` piercing damage and have the versatile S and sweep trails. When you take the Bone Spikes action, you can choose one weapon on your person and duplicate its weapon runes onto your bone spikes (with the exception of any runes that couldn't apply to the bone spears).

**Awakening** Your bones grow longer, lashing flexibly at range. While you have bone spikes, you can [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to give your bone spikes reach <10 feet> until the end of the current turn.

**Awakening** Grooves in your bone spikes form a channel for venom. Your bone spikes deal `1d4` [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), which increases to `2d4` at 10th level and `3d4` at 18th level.
