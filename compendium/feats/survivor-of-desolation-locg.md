[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Reclaimant Dedication](compendium/feats/knight-reclaimant-dedication-locg.md)

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against unnatural weather events or environmental hazards occurring in blighted or otherwise unnaturally marred regions. If you roll a success on a saving throw against such an effect, you get a critical success instead; if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. This does not apply to unnatural events created or directed by active effects, such as spells that create anomalous weather or hazardous areas.
