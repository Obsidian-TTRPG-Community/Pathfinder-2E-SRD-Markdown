# Precious Alloys  *Feat 5*  
talos  


Choose cold iron or silver. Your melee unarmed attacks have the special properties of a weapon made of that metal. If you are at least 13th level, you can choose adamantine instead of just cold iron or silver.

**Special.** You can take this ancestry feat multiple times, choosing a different metal each time.
