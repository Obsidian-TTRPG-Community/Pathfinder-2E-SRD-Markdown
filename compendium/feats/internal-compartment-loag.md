# Internal Compartment  *Feat 1*  
[android](rules/traits/android-loag.md "Android Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You can hide a small object of up to light Bulk inside a hollow cavity on one of your forearms. It takes three [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions to store an object in this way. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to the DCs of checks for others to [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) or [Steal](rules/actions/steal.md) objects stored inside your arm. If you store a weapon in your arm, you can use a single action to [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to draw the weapon into the hand corresponding to your internal cavity, then [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the weapon.
