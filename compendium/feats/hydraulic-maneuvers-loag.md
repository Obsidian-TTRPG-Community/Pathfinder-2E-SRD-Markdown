[azarketi](rules/traits/azarketi-loag.md "Azarketi Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You batter your foes with a torrent of water siphoned from your surroundings. If the next action you take is an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md), [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md), or [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md), that action has a range of 15 feet. You don't receive any item bonuses to that check or any circumstance bonuses related to your physical body, but if you roll a critical failure on that [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check, you get a failure instead.
