# Hydraulic Maneuvers  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 13*  
[azarketi](rules/traits/azarketi-loag.md)  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md)  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [water](rules/traits/water.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You batter your foes with a torrent of water siphoned from your surroundings. If the next action you take is an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md), [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md), or [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md), that action has a range of 15 feet. You don't receive any item bonuses to that check or any circumstance bonuses related to your physical body, but if you roll a critical failure on that [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check, you get a failure instead.
