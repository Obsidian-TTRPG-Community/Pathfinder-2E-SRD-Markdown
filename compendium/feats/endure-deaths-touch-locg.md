# Endure Death's Touch  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Knight Vigilant Dedication](compendium/feats/knight-vigilant-dedication-locg.md), expert in medium or heavy armor
- **Trigger** An undead hits you with an unarmed attack.
- **Requirements**: You are wearing medium or heavy armor in which you have expert proficiency.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your conviction redirects the undead's attack through your armor and then harmlessly away. You gain resistance 5 to physical damage and resistance 10 to negative damage against the triggering attack. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throws against effects from the undead's natural attack; if you succeed at the saving throw, you get a critical success instead.
