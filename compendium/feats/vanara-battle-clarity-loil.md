# Vanara Battle Clarity  *Feat 13*  
[vanara](rules/traits/vanara-loil.md "Vanara Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your focus in combat is practically unshakable.

While you can act, you aren't [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden), [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected), or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or to creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack.
