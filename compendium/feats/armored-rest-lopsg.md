# Armored Rest  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Swordmaster Dedication](compendium/feats/swordmaster-dedication-locg.md); trained in light, medium, or heavy armor

You've slept many nights in your armor and gotten used to it.

You can sleep in armor overnight without being [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) the next day. If you were already [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) before sleeping, the armor doesn't prevent you from recovering from being [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued).
