# Bless Shield  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](compendium/feats/lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md), you worship a good-aligned deity
- **Activity** Single Action

Your uttered prayers become an aegis, drawing the blessing of your deity across the surface of your shield. Until the beginning of your next turn your shield, any [shield boss](compendium/equipment/items/shield-boss.md), or [shield spikes](compendium/equipment/items/shield-spikes.md) gain the effects of a [ghost touch](compendium/equipment/items/ghost-touch.md) property rune. Additionally, damage you take as a result of an incorporeal creature's [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) can trigger your Shield Block reaction, even if the damage isn't physical damage.
