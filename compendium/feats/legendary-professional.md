[general](rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore)

Your fame has spread throughout the lands (for instance, if you have [Warfare Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), you might be a legendary general or tactician). This works as [Legendary Performer](compendium/feats/legendary-performer.md), except you gain higher-level jobs when you [Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md) with [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).
