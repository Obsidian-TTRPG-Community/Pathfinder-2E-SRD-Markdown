[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Exorcist Dedication](compendium/feats/exorcist-dedication-botd.md)
- **Cost**: 1 spirit wisp or spirit remnant from your spirit dwelling
- **Requirements**: You are holding your spirit dwelling.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You purify a spirit by coaxing it to release its anguish in a final cathartic howl. This deals sonic damage to all creatures in a 30-foot cone, with a basic Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If you expend a spirit wisp, this deals `1d4` sonic damage per level you have. If you expend a spirit remnant, this deals `1d6` sonic damage per level of the incorporeal undead or haunt from which you gained the remnant.
