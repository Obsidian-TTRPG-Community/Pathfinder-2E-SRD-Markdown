# Green Tongue  *Feat 12*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Green Empathy](compendium/feats/green-empathy.md)

You share a special kinship with all things green and living. You (and your leshy familiar, if you have one) are constantly under the effects of [speak with plants](compendium/spells/speak-with-plants.md). Most non-creature plants recognize you as a druid of the leaf order and are [friendly](rules/conditions.md#Friendly) to you.
