# Telekinetic Slip  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 9*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  [kashrishi](rules/traits/kashrishi-loil.md)  [occult](rules/traits/occult.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** Your turn begins, and you're [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained).
- **Activity** Reaction

A thin shell of telekinetic energy pushes from your skin, widening your enemy's grasp enough for you to slip free. You gain a +2 status bonus to checks to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) from whatever has you [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained). This bonus lasts until either you're no longer [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained), or you fall [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious).
