# Progenitor Lore  *Feat 1*  
[reflection](rules/traits/reflection-da.md "Reflection Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You didn't just inherit your physical form from your progenitor; you also retained some of their knowledge. You're trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) and [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in a [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) corresponding to your ancestry (e. g., [Elf Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) if your progenitor is an elf).
