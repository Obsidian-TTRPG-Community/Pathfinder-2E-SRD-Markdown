# Wonder Worker  *Feat 20*  
[thaumaturge](rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md "Thaumaturge Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion)

The thaumaturge's path culminates with the working of wonders. Once per day, you can align your esoterica to cast a spell of 8th level or lower that takes 1, 2, or 3 actions to cast. The spell must be common or one to which you have access. You can choose a spell of any tradition for which you're legendary in the associated skill ([Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) for arcane, [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature) for primal, [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) for occult, or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) for divine). Use your thaumaturge class DC in place of any necessary spell DC and your thaumaturge class DC â€“ 10 in place of any necessary counteract modifier or spell attack modifier.
