# Elaborate Flourish  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You embellish your spellcasting with entrancing flourishes and grand pronouncements, making it harder to identify or counter. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), creatures with the ability to [Cast that Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) don't automatically know what the spell is. In addition, creatures that witness your spellcasting take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to checks to identify the spell with [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) and checks to counteract the spell during its casting (such as with Counterspell).
