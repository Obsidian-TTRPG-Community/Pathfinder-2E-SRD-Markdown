# Pushing Attack  *Feat 10*  
[evolution](rules/traits/evolution-som.md)  [summoner](rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  


Your eidolon has an attack that pushes away enemies.

Choose one of the eidolon's unarmed attacks with the [shove](rules/traits/shove.md) trait. It gains the [Push](rules/abilities/push.md) action for that attack.
