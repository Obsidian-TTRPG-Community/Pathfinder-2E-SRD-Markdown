# Unshakable Grit  *Feat 12*  
[gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Grit and Tenacity](compendium/feats/grit-and-tenacity-g-g.md)

You've become hardened by conflict after everything you've faced, and you possess a certain intractable stubbornness. If the reroll granted to you by your Grit and Tenacity reaction is a success, you get a critical success instead; if it's a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
