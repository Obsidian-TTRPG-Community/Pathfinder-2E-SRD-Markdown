# Shatter Space  *Feat 14*  
[amp](rules/traits/amp-da.md "Amp Feat Trait")  [psychic](rules/traits/psychic-da.md "Psychic Class Trait")  


The sheer power of your magic fractures reality. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry. The cantrip must be one that takes 2 or more actions to cast.
