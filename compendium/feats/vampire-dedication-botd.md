# Vampire Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: You were a killed by a vampire drinking your blood.

You're a newly risen vampire. You gain the [undead](rules/traits/undead.md "Undead Creature Type Trait") and [vampire](rules/traits/vampire-b1.md "Vampire Creature Trait") traits and the basic undead benefits (page 44), and your undead hunger is for the blood of the living. Your incisors elongate; you gain a fangs unarmed attack that deals `1d6` piercing damage. They're in the brawling group and have the [grapple](rules/traits/grapple.md "Grapple Weapon Trait") and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits. You gain revulsion and sunlight vulnerabilities detailed on page 59 and the Drink Blood ability.

title: **Drink Blood** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") ([divine](rules/traits/divine.md), [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md))

- **Requirements**: A [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained), [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), or willing creature is within your reach

**Effect** You sink your fangs into that creature and drink its blood. This requires an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), and automatically succeeds for any of the other conditions. If you succeed, the creature becomes [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained), and you gain temporary HP equal to the target's level that last for 10 minutes. Further uses against the target don't increase the [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) condition or grant you more temporary HP.
