# Mistaken Identity  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 5*  
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [reflection](rules/traits/reflection-da.md "Reflection Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Trigger** You're about to attempt a saving throw against a [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect.
- **Activity** Reaction

You feel a strong connection with your progenitor and can convince yourself an effect targeting your mind was meant for theirs instead, allowing you to shrug off harmful effects. Roll the saving throw twice, and take the higher result. However, subsuming your identity is disturbing, and you're [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
