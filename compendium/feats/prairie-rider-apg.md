# Prairie Rider  *Feat 1*  
[halfling](rules/traits/halfling.md "Halfling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You grew up riding your clan's shaggy ponies and riding dogs. You become trained in [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature). If you would automatically become trained in [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also get a +1 circumstance bonus to [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) if the target is a traditional halfling mount, such as a pony or riding dog.
