# Brawling Focus  *Feat 2*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  


You know how to make the most of your attacks when fighting hand-to-hand. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of unarmed strikes in the brawling group and weapons in the brawling group. If you have [Monastic Weaponry](compendium/feats/monastic-weaponry.md), you also gain the critical specialization effects of all monk weapons in which you are trained.
