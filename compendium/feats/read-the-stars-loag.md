# Read The Stars  *Feat 9*  
[lizardfolk](rules/traits/lizardfolk-b1.md "Lizardfolk Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Astrology Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) or [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism)

You're incredibly skilled in iruxi astrology, and you can gain useful (if cryptic) hints from the stars' alignment. Once per night, if you can clearly see the stars, you can spend 1 hour reading the heavens to see how they relate to a particular goal, event, or activity that will occur within 1 week. The GM rolls a secret check, either a DC 28 [Astrology Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check or a DC 32 [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) check. On a success, you learn a cryptic clue or piece of advice that could help with the chosen event, and on a critical failure, you learn a misleading cryptic clue or piece of advice.
