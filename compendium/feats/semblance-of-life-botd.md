[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md)  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md)  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mummy Dedication](compendium/feats/mummy-dedication-botd.md)
- **Trigger** You deal damage to a living creature with your fist [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or with [Desiccating Inhalation](compendium/feats/desiccating-inhalation-botd.md).
- **Activity** Free Action

You draw the moisture you've drained from others into your own flesh, temporarily taking on the appearance of life. This has the effects of [illusory disguise](compendium/spells/illusory-disguise.md), except you can appear only as yourself while you were a living humanoid.
