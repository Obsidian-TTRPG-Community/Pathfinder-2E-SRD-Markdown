# Social Camouflage  *Feat 1*  
[vishkanya](rules/traits/vishkanya-loil.md "Vishkanya Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You have the uncanny ability to quickly blend into the lifestyle of whatever settlement in which you find yourself. After residing in a particular settlement for at least 1 day, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) to pass yourself off as a resident of that settlement. Additionally, you can use [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) in place of [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) to [Gather Information](rules/actions/gather-information.md) while in that settlement. The GM might decide you need more time in particularly large settlements to gain these benefits, or might decide you gain the benefits only while in a specific district or part of the settlement.
