# Quick Change  *Feat 7*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Vigilante Dedication](compendium/feats/vigilante-dedication-apg.md)

You can shift between your identities with ease. Instead of spending 1 minute to change your identity, you can now do so as a 3-action activity. If you are legendary in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), you can perform this change as a 1-action activity.
