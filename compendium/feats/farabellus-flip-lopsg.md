# Farabellus Flip  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  [ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) and medium armor
- **Trigger** An enemy targets you with a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

Surprisingly agile even in a breastplate and carrying a full rucksack, Marcos Farabellus developed this evasive maneuver during one of his many adventures. Flinging your body into a twisting somersault, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against the triggering attack.

If the attack still hits you, you can [Step](rules/actions/step.md) to an open space that's still within the triggering enemy's reach, turning the impact of the blow into momentum.
