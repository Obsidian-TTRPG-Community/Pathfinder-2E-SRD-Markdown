# Rebounding Assault  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm or loaded crossbow in one hand and a bludgeoning or slashing melee weapon in the other.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You hurl your melee weapon at an opponent, then fire a bullet into the weapon's hilt, making it deal additional damage and bounce back to your grasp. Make a thrown ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the melee weapon, then a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with your firearm.

Both [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) use the same multiple attack penalty. If the melee weapon doesn't already have the [thrown](rules/traits/thrown.md "Thrown Weapon Trait") trait, it gains the thrown <10 feet> trait during a Rebounding Assault.

If both attacks are successful, the bolt or bullet hits the thrown melee weapon instead of your target, adding its force into one attack. Combine the damage from both [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), using the thrown weapon's damage type, and add an additional `1d6` precision damage.

The impact sends the melee weapon rebounding off the target and back to your hand.

In any circumstance other than both attacks hitting, carry out the individual [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) normally. The thrown weapon doesn't rebound and remains in the target's space as normal for thrown weapons.
