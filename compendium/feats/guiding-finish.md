# Guiding Finish  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  [press](rules/traits/press.md "Press Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding only a single one-handed melee weapon and have your other hand or hands free.
- **Activity** Single Action

Using your weapon as a lever, you force your opponent to end up right where you want them. Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the required weapon. If the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) hits, you can move the target up to 10 feet into a space in your reach. You can move the target through your space during this movement. This follows the forced movement rules found on page 475. Your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) gains the following failure effect.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Failure** You can force the creature to move as you would on a success, but you can move the target only 5 feet.
