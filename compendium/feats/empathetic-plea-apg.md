# Empathetic Plea  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md)  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md)  [gnome](rules/traits/gnome.md)  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md)  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy)
- **Trigger** You are attacked by a creature that you haven't yet acted [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) toward. You must use this reaction before the creature rolls its attack.
- **Activity** Reaction

The way you cringe or use those puppydog eyes you've been practicing elicits an empathetic response in the attacker.

Attempt a [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check against your attacker's Will DC.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature pulls its attack, wasting its action, and can't use [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) actions against you until the beginning of its next turn.
> - **Success** The creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to damage on the triggering [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) and all its [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) against you until the beginning of its next turn. The penalty is –4 if you're an expert in [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), –6 if you're a master, and –8 if you're legendary.
> - **Failure** The creature's attack is unaffected, and the creature is temporarily immune to your Empathic Pleas for 24 hours.
