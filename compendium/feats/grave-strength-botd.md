# Grave Strength  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghoul Dedication](compendium/feats/ghoul-dedication-botd.md)

The flesh you've consumed over the course of your existence as a ghoul has made you stronger, gifting you with strange insights from the minds of the sapient creatures you've devoured and bringing you closer to a state of undead perfection. You gain the advanced undead benefits (page 44). In addition, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed while you're satiated.
