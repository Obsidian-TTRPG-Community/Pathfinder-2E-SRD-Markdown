# Ferrousoul  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  talos  


Whether in their pure elemental forms or as part of an alloy such as steel, the elemental metal in your soul resonates strongly with iron, bronze, and other sturdy, practical metals suitable for weaponry. Your fist attacks gain the modular B, P, or S trait (Pathfinder Treasure Vault 25) and lose the [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait") trait. Your fist's damage die increases to `1d6`.
