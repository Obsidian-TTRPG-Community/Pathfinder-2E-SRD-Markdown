# Follow-up Strike  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [flourish](rules/traits/flourish.md "Flourish Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Martial Artist Dedication](compendium/feats/martial-artist-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: Your last action was a missed [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a melee unarmed attack.
- **Activity** Single Action

You have trained to use all parts of your body as a weapon, and when you miss with an attack, you can usually continue the attack with a different body part and still deal damage.

Make another [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a melee unarmed attack, using the same multiple attack penalty as for the missed [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), if any.
