[wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: a familiar

You infuse your familiar with additional magical energy. You can select four familiar or master abilities each day, instead of two.

**Special.** If your arcane thesis is improved familiar attunement, your familiar's base number of familiar abilities, before adding any extra abilities from the arcane thesis, is four.
