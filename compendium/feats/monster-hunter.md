# Monster Hunter  *Feat 1*  
[ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md)  


You swiftly assess your prey and apply what you know. As part of the action used to [Hunt your Prey](rules/actions/hunt-prey.md), you can attempt a check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about your prey. When you critically succeed at identifying your hunted prey with [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), you note a weakness in the creature's defenses. You and allies you tell gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against that prey. You can give bonuses from Monster Hunter only once per day against a particular creature.

## Monster Hunter leads to...

[Master Monster Hunter](compendium/feats/master-monster-hunter.md), [Legendary Monster Hunter](compendium/feats/legendary-monster-hunter.md), [Monster Warden](compendium/feats/monster-warden.md)
