# Moment Of Clarity  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You push back your rage for a moment in order to think clearly. Until the end of this turn, you can use actions with the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait even if those actions don't have the [rage](rules/traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait") trait.
