# Unkillable  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Zombie Dedication](compendium/feats/zombie-dedication-botd.md)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger** You would be reduced to 0 HP.
- **Activity** Reaction

You're relentless and nigh unkillable, shrugging off blows that should destroy you, though they might make your body start to fall apart. You are reduced to 1 HP instead of 0 HP. You must succeed at a DC 6 flat check or your body deteriorates.
