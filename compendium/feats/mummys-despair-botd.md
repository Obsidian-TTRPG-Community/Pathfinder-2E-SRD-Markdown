You force your mental anguish outward, projecting it upon those around you. You gain an aura of despair in a 30-foot emanation lasting 5 rounds. A creature that enters or begins its turn in the aura must succeed at a Will save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or be [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) ([frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical failure). A creature that succeeds at the save is temporarily immune to Mummy's Despair for 10 minutes.
