- **Activity** Single Action

Your eidolon evolves wings, a buoyant body, or some other means to control descent. It glides slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down and up to 25 feet forward through the air. As long as it spends at least 1 action gliding each round and has not yet reached the ground, it remains in the air at the end of your turn.
