# Nameless Anonymity  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magic Warrior Dedication](compendium/feats/magic-warrior-dedication-lowg.md)

Your mask protects you further from divination. Once per day, you can cast [nondetection](compendium/spells/nondetection.md) on yourself, heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast; the spell ends immediately if your mask is removed for even a moment. The spell is of the same tradition as your focus spells.
