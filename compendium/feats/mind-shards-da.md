# Mind Shards  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mind Smith Dedication](compendium/feats/mind-smith-dedication-da.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

With a swing and a thought, you detonate your mind weapon into a burst of psychic shards that shred the mind.

You concentrate and unleash a 15-foot cone that deals `3d6` mental damage to all creatures in the area, with a basic Will save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. After the attack, your mind weapon automatically re-forms, and you can't use this ability again for 1 minute. Mind Shards' damage increases by `1d6` at level 7 and every two levels thereafter.
