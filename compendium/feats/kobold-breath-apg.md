- **Activity** Two-Action

You channel your draconic exemplar's power into a gout of energy that manifests as a 30-foot line or a 15-foot cone, dealing `1d4` damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a basic saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. You can't use this ability again for `1d4` rounds.

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by `1d4`. The shape of the breath, the damage type, and the saving throw match those of your draconic exemplar (see Table 1â€“1). This ability has the trait associated with the type of damage it deals.

## Kobold Breath leads to...
