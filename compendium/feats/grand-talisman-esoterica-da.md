# Grand Talisman Esoterica  *Feat 14*  
[thaumaturge](rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Talisman Esoterica

You've completed your journey in studying esoteric talismans, gaining the ability to place multiple talismans on an item. Normally, affixing more than one talisman to an item causes the talismans to be suppressed, but when you [Affix a Talisman](rules/actions/affix-a-talisman.md), you can specially treat one item you're working on, allowing it to have two active talismans at once. This special treatment ends if you use [Affix a Talisman](rules/actions/affix-a-talisman.md) to treat a new item with this ability.
