- **Activity** Three-Action

The seasons shift rapidly. This impulse affects a cube 100 feet in each dimension within 1,000 feet. Choose the starting season. The impulse lasts for 4 rounds, proceeding to the next season at the start of each of your turns. You can't use this impulse again until the previous one ends. Spring Each ally in the cube gains 20 temporary HP that last until the start of your next turn. Any [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) ally rolls a recovery check, but can't get worse than a success.

Summer (light) Each enemy in the area is exposed to sunlight and must attempt a Reflex save against your class DC. It's unaffected on a critical success, dazed until the start of your next turn on a success, or [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) until the start of your next turn on a failure.

Autumn Leaves and rain make everything in the area [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) until the start of your next turn, and a cold wind makes each enemy in the area [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) until the start of your next turn unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your class DC.

Winter Each enemy in the aura takes `5d6` cold damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. A creature that fails its save also takes `2d6` [persistent cold damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
