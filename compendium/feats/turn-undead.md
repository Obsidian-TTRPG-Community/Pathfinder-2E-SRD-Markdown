# Turn Undead  *Feat 2*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  


Undead harmed by your positive energy might flee, compelled by an innate aversion to the force opposite undeath. When you use a [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) spell to damage undead, each undead of your level or lower that critically fails its save gains the [fleeing](rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) condition for 1 round.
