# Replicate  *Feat 5*  
[reflection](rules/traits/reflection-da.md "Reflection Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Clone-Risen](compendium/feats/clone-risen-da.md)

You've learned to reshape your malleable form. You can cast [illusory disguise](compendium/spells/illusory-disguise.md) once per day as an innate occult spell. This is a [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait") and [morph](rules/traits/morph.md "Morph Effect Trait") effect, as your body physically transforms, rather than an [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait") effect.
