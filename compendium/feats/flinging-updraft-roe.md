- **Activity** Two-Action

A speeding wind heeds your call, picking someone up and depositing them nearby. Choose a creature within 60 feet of you. The target jumps in any direction, up to a maximum of 30 feet. If the target doesn't land on a space of solid ground within 30 feet of where it started, it falls unless it has a fly Speed but doesn't take any damage from the fall. You choose the distance and direction of the jump. If you target an unwilling creature, it attempts a Reflex save against your class DC with the following results.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** You make the creature jump up to half the maximum distance.
> - **Critical Failure** You make the creature jump up to the maximum distance. Level (+2) The maximum distance increases by 15 feet.
