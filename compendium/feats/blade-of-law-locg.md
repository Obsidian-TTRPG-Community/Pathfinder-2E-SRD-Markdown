# Blade Of Law  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hellknight Dedication](compendium/feats/hellknight-dedication-locg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You call upon the power of law and make a weapon or unarmed [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe you have witnessed breaking or disrespecting the law or otherwise acting disorderly. The [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) deals two extra weapon damage dice if the target of your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) is chaotic. Whether or not the target is chaotic, you can convert the physical damage from the attack into lawful damage.
