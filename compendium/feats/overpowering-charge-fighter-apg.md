# Overpowering Charge (Fighter)  *Feat 10*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Barreling Charge

You trample foes as you charge past. When you use Barreling Charge and successfully move through a creature's space, that creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier. On a critical success, the creature takes double damage and is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the end of your next turn.
