- **Activity** Three-Action

You plant the seed of a giant bladderwort in an unoccupied square of ground or water within 30 feet. It lasts for 10 minutes.

Using this impulse again ends any previous one. If a creature enters its square, the seed erupts into a voluminous, translucent plant that seals tight around the triggering creature and fills with water. Unless the creature succeeds at a Reflex save against your class DC, it's [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) within the bladderwort and must hold its breath or begin drowning. The [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) DC is also your class DC. The plant has AC 10 and 50 Hit Points.

If a creature dies inside it, the plant shrinks down, converting itself and the remains into a watery fruit. A creature can eat this consumable to regain `1d8+4` HP, after which that creature is temporarily immune for 10 minutes. This fruit rots after 1 hour.
