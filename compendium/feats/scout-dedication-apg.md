# Scout Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) and [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival)

You are a highly skilled scout, capable of providing your allies a timely warning of any danger. You gain the [Scout's Warning (ranger)](compendium/feats/scouts-warning-ranger.md) ranger feat. When you're using the [Scout](rules/actions/scout.md) exploration activity, you grant your allies a +2 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls instead of a +1 circumstance bonus.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the scout archetype.

## Scout Dedication leads to...

[Fleeting Shadow](compendium/feats/fleeting-shadow-apg.md), [Scout's Charge](compendium/feats/scouts-charge-apg.md), [Scout's Pounce](compendium/feats/scouts-pounce-apg.md), [Scout's Speed](compendium/feats/scouts-speed-apg.md), [Terrain Scout](compendium/feats/terrain-scout-apg.md), [Eclipsed Vitality](compendium/feats/eclipsed-vitality-lokl.md)
