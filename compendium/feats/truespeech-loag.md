# Truespeech  *Feat 13*  
[aasimar](rules/traits/aasimar-apg.md "Aasimar Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Angelkin](compendium/feats/angelkin-apg.md)

It is paramount that you are understood and you understand others; language need not impede your message. You can cast [tongues](compendium/spells/tongues.md) as a 5th-level divine innate spell once per day on yourself only. You gain a +1 status bonus to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks for the duration of the spell when speaking to creatures with whom you already shared a language before casting.
