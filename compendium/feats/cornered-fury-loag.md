# Cornered Fury  *Feat 5*  
[ratfolk](rules/traits/ratfolk-b1.md "Ratfolk Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


When physically outmatched, you fight with unexpected ferocity. If a foe of a larger size than you critically hits and damages you, that foe is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to you for 1 round.
