# Mind Projectiles  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mind Smith Dedication](compendium/feats/mind-smith-dedication-da.md)

You have learned to stretch your mind's influence further, releasing projectiles with a swing of your mind weapon. You can make ranged mind weapon [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md); these are ranged [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) with a maximum range of 30 feet that deal `1d6` damage of the same type as your mind weapon. Your ranged mind weapon [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) gains all the benefits of your mind weapon's runes as long as they still apply to a ranged weapon.

For example, if your weapon had +1, striking, and spell storing runes, you would get a +1 item bonus to hit with your ranged mind weapon [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), and it would deal the additional damage from the striking rune, but it wouldn't be able to unleash a spell from the spell storing rune, as that rune can be etched onto only melee weapons.
