# Summon Celestial Kin  *Feat 13*  
[aasimar](rules/traits/aasimar-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: any aasimar lineage feat

You have a connection to the celestial realms, allowing you to summon a celestial ally. Once per day, you can cast [summon celestial](compendium/spells/summon-celestial.md) as a 5th-level divine innate spell, but the celestial summoned must be from the same category as your own lineage, such as a creature with the [angel](rules/traits/angel.md) trait if you are angelkin.
