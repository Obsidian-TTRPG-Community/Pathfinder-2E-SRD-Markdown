# Deceptive Worship  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism)

Members of your cult frequently pass themselves off as worshippers of other religions. You can use [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) instead of [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) a typical worshipper of another faith or to [Lie](rules/actions/lie.md) specifically to claim you are a member of the faith you are Impersonating. You still need to use the [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) skill to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) a specific worshipper or to perform other deceptive actions, such as attempting to [Lie](rules/actions/lie.md) about any other matter.
