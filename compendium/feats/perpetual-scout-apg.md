# Perpetual Scout  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Horizon Walker Dedication](compendium/feats/horizon-walker-dedication-apg.md)

You spot anything out of place in the areas you know best. While in your favored terrain, you always gain the benefits of the [Scout](rules/actions/scout.md) exploration activity, even if you are performing another exploration activity. If you're legendary in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival), you gain these benefits in any terrain.
