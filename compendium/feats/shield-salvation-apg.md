# Shield Salvation  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bastion Dedication](compendium/feats/bastion-dedication-apg.md)

You can save your shield from total destruction, even after a devastating attack. If a shield would be destroyed due to damage taken during your [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md), the shield remains intact at 1 Hit Point instead. Its construction is weakened until you take the time to repair it, preventing you from using Shield Salvation to save the same shield until your next preparations.
