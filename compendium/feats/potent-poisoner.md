# Potent Poisoner  *Feat 10*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md "Alchemist Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Powerful Alchemy](compendium/feats/powerful-alchemy.md)

By concentrating your poisons' toxic components, you make them harder for victims to resist. When you craft an alchemical item with the [poison](rules/traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait") trait by any means, the DC is increased by up to 4, to a maximum of your class DC.
