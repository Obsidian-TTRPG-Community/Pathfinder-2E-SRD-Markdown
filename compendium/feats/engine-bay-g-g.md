# Engine Bay  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vehicle Mechanic Dedication](compendium/feats/vehicle-mechanic-dedication-g-g.md), expert in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

You are practiced at working in vast garages of vehicles and can work on many machines at a time. When Repairing and spending the full 10 minutes, you can fix up to two objects. If you are a master in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting), you can fix up to four targets. If you're legendary in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting), you can fix up to eight targets.

This feat has no effect when using [Quick Repair](compendium/feats/quick-repair.md) or another ability to reduce the time spent Repairing.
