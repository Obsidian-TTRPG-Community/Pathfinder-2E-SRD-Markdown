# Methodical Debilitations  *Feat 10*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: mastermind racket, [Debilitating Strike](rules/actions/debilitating-strike.md)

You strategically craft your debilitations to lessen or negate an enemy's tactical advantages. Add the following debilitations to the list you can choose from when you use [Debilitating Strike](rules/actions/debilitating-strike.md).

- **Debilitation** The target can't flank other creatures, and it can't provide flanking for its allies.
- **Debilitation** The target doesn't gain a circumstance bonus to AC from [Raising a Shield](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md), lesser cover, or standard cover; it gains only a +2 circumstance bonus to AC from greater cover or [Taking Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md).
