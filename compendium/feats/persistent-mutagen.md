# Persistent Mutagen  *Feat 16*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md "Alchemist Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Extend Elixir](compendium/feats/extend-elixir.md)

You've trained your physical form to remain stable within the a given altered state. Once per day, when you consume an [alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait") item with the [infused](rules/traits/infused.md "Infused Item Trait") and [mutagen](rules/traits/mutagen.md "Mutagen Item Trait") traits, you can retain its effects until the next time you make your daily preparations instead of its normal duration.
