# Cadence Call  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md)  [flourish](rules/traits/flourish.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Marshal Dedication](compendium/feats/marshal-dedication-apg.md)
- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Activity** Single Action

You call out a quick cadence, guiding your allies into a more efficient rhythm. Each willing ally within your marshal's aura is [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) until the end of their next turn, and they can use the extra action only to [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md). At the end of each ally's turn, if they used the extra action, they then become [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) until the end of their following turn.

## Cadence Call leads to...

[Tactical Cadence](compendium/feats/tactical-cadence-apg.md)
