# Anoint Ally  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md "Sorcerer Class Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You forge a mystical connection with an ally using your body as a focus, allowing them to benefit from your magic.

You place a blood rune on an adjacent ally that lasts for 1 minute. When you would gain a blood magic effect, you can forgo it, granting it to your ally instead. You can anoint only one ally at a time; if you place another rune, your previous designation ends.
