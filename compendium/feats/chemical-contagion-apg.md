# Chemical Contagion  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 16*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md "Alchemist Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** A creature within 30 feet critically fails its initial saving throw against a poison you created.
- **Activity** Reaction

With carefully engineered enzymes, you coax some of your poison to infect another target, using the original victim as a carrier. A creature adjacent to the triggering creature is exposed to the triggering poison.
