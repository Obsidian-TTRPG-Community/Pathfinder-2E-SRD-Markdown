# Edgewatch Detective Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Intelligence 14 or Wisdom 14

You become trained in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) or [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery); if you are already trained in both of these skills, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can use [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) instead of [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) to [Track](rules/actions/track.md), and you gain the [Experienced Tracker](compendium/feats/experienced-tracker.md) skill feat (Core Rulebook 261).

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the this archetype.
