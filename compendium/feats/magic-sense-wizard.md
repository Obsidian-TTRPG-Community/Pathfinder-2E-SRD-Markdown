# Magic Sense (Wizard)  *Feat 12*  
[arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait")  [detection](rules/traits/detection.md "Detection Effect Trait")  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md "Wizard Class Trait")  


You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity. You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a 1st-level [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only. When you [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md), you gain the benefits of a 3rd-level [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.
