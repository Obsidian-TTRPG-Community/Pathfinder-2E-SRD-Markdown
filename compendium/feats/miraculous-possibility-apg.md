# Miraculous Possibility  *Feat 18*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  


Your deity empowers you to perform minor miracles, allowing you to readily adapt to the fluctuating needs of your duties. Once during your daily preparations, you can use a spell slot to hold sheer divine potential, rather than using it to prepare a spell. You can use this spell slot to cast any spell you know from the divine spell list that's at least 2 levels lower than the slot you designate. The spell acts in all ways as a spell of 2 levels lower. You don't have any particular spell prepared in that slot until you cast it.
