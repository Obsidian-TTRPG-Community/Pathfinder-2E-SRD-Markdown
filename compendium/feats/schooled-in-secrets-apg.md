# Schooled In Secrets  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism)

You notice the signs and symbols that members of mystery cults and other secret societies use to declare their affiliation to fellow members. You can use [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) in place of [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) to [Gather Information](rules/actions/gather-information.md) about such groups. If you belong to a secret cult, lodge, sect, or similar organization, you automatically recognize members of your group unless they are specifically attempting to conceal their presence from you.
