If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) by meditating over the earthly remains of a dead sentient creature. Focus spells granted by the reanimator archetype are from the same tradition as those used to meet the archetype's prerequisite.
