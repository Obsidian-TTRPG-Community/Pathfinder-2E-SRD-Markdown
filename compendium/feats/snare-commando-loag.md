# Snare Commando  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 9*  
[kobold](rules/traits/kobold-b1.md "Kobold Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), [Snare Crafting](compendium/feats/snare-crafting.md)
- **Trigger** A creature fails or critically fails a save against your snare.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your snares are so befuddling that your victims rarely notice you slipping out of sight. If you have expert proficiency in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), you can [Create a Diversion](rules/actions/create-a-diversion.md) against the triggering creature. If you have expert proficiency in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), you can instead [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) the triggering creature. If you have both, choose one of the two effects.
