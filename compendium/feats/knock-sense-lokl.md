# Knock Sense  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  [fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.
- **Activity** Single Action

You attack carefully to knock some sense into a creature whose actions aren't their own. Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused) ally. The [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) is nonlethal and doesn't take a â€“2 penalty for using a weapon without the [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md) trait; if you hit and deal damage, your ally automatically succeeds at the flat check to remove the [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused) condition when taking damage.
