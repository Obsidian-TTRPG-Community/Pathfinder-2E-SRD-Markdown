# Crude Communication  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Linguist Dedication](compendium/feats/linguist-dedication-apg.md)

Even if you don't speak a creature's language, you can rely on inflection, root words, and body language to infer rudimentary meaning. If you interact with a creature for at least 10 minutes and that creature can speak a language, the GM rolls a secret [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) check with a DC appropriate for the language's rarity. On a success, you understand the gist of the meaning and can communicate basic concepts back to the creature; on a failure, you are mistaken or communicate incorrect concepts. If you're legendary in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society), you can communicate instantly without needing to attempt a [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) check; even if you didn't know the medium of communication the creature uses (speech, sign language, and so on), you intuit this information as soon as they try to communicate.
