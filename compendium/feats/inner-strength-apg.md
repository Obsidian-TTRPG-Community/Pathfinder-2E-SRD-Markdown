# Inner Strength  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

Your strength is part of your rage, so as long as your anger remains, you can gather your strength and rage to overcome any sort of enfeeblement. You reduce your [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition's value by 1.
