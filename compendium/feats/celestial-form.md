# Celestial Form  *Feat 18*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of good

You take on a celestial countenance, appearing like a type of celestial who serves your deity; for example, as an angel, you would gain a halo and feathery wings. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. You gain [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md) if you don't already have it, and you gain the [celestial](rules/traits/celestial.md "Celestial Creature Type Trait") trait and the trait appropriate to the type of servitor you've become ([archon](rules/traits/archon.md "Archon Creature Trait"), [angel](rules/traits/angel.md "Angel Creature Trait"), or [azata](rules/traits/azata.md "Azata Creature Trait"), for example).
