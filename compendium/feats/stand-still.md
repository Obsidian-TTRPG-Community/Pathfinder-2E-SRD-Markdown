# Stand Still  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a move action or leaves a square during a move action it's using.
- **Activity** Reaction

You strike out when your foe tries to flee. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a move action, you disrupt that action.
