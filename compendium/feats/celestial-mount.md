# Celestial Mount  *Feat 20*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: divine ally (steed), tenets of good

Your steed gains incredible celestial powers granted by your deity. It gains [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md), its maximum Hit Points increase by 40, and it gains weakness 10 to evil damage.

Additionally, it grows wings appropriate to a servitor of your deity (such as metallic wings for an archon), granting it a fly Speed equal to its Speed. It gains the [celestial](rules/traits/celestial.md) trait and the trait appropriate to the type of servitor it has become ([archon](rules/traits/archon.md), [angel](rules/traits/angel.md), or [azata](rules/traits/azata.md), for example).
