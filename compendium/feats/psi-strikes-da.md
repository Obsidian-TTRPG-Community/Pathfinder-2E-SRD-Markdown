# Psi Strikes  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 4*  
[mindshift](rules/traits/mindshift-da.md "Mindshift Action & Ability Trait")  [psychic](rules/traits/psychic-da.md "Psychic Class Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per turn
- **Requirements**: Your most recent action was to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) or to [Unleash your Psyche](rules/actions/unleash-psyche-da.md).
- **Activity** Free Action

You siphon residual psychic energies from your spell into one weapon you're wielding or one of your unarmed attacks and when you unleash your mind, the energies flare to match. The attack deals an extra `1d6` force damage until the end of the current turn. If your [Psyche is Unleashed](rules/actions/unleash-psyche-da.md), this benefit instead lasts until your psyche subsides.
