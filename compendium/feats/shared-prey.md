[ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md "Ranger Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Double Prey](compendium/feats/double-prey.md), [Warden's Boon](compendium/feats/wardens-boon.md)

Hunting as a duo, you and your ally both single out your prey. When you use [Hunt Prey](rules/actions/hunt-prey.md) and select only one prey, you can grant your [Hunt Prey](rules/actions/hunt-prey.md) benefits and hunter's edge to an ally in addition to gaining them yourself. The ally retains these benefits until you use [Hunt Prey](rules/actions/hunt-prey.md) again.

## Shared Prey leads to...

[Triple Threat](compendium/feats/triple-threat.md)
