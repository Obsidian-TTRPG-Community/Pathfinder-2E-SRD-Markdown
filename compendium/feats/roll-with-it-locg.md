# Roll With It  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 9*  
[goblin](rules/traits/goblin.md "Goblin Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: unbreakable goblin heritage, [Bouncy Goblin](compendium/feats/bouncy-goblin-locg.md)
- **Trigger** A foe hits you with a melee weapon or unarmed attack.
- **Activity** Reaction

When you take a big hit, your foe bounces you around like a rubber ball, but you escape the worst of the blow. Your foe can move you any distance of its choice up to 30 feet in a direction of its choice (this is not forced movement, and it triggers reactions as normal). You fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) and are [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned). Attempt a DC 6 flat check. On a success, you take minimum damage from the attack, and on a critical success, if the attack was a critical hit, you don't take double damage from the critical hit.
