# Animal Speaker  *Feat 5*  
[sprite](rules/traits/sprite-b1.md "Sprite Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: ability to communicate with some type of animals (such as bats or arthropods)

You can speak to all animals, not just a particular subset. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on animals (which usually uses the [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) skill).
