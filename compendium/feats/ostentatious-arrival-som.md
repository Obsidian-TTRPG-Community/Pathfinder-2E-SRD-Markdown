# Ostentatious Arrival  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 6*  
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  [summoner](rules/traits/summoner-som.md "Summoner Class Trait")  

- **Activity** Free Action

If the next action you take is to [Manifest your Eidolon](rules/actions/manifest-eidolon-som.md) as a three-action activity, or to Cast a three-action summoning Spell, the creature appears in an explosion.

All creatures in a 10-foot emanation around the creature you summoned or manifested take `1d4` fire damage per spell level for a summoning spell, or `1d4` damage per 2 levels for Manifesting your Eidolon. If the creature you summoned or manifested has the acid, cold, electricity, fire, [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait"), or [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") trait, the damage is that type instead (or cold damage for the [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") trait). If the creature has more than one of these traits, you choose which damage type to deal.
