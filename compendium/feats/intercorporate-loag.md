# Intercorporate  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 5*  
[aphorite](rules/traits/aphorite-loag.md "Aphorite Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Requirements**: You're afflicted by a disease or poison, or are taking [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
- **Activity** Single Action

Your ordered physiology rejects unwelcome elements. Choose one.

**[Disease](rules/traits/disease.md "Disease Effect Trait") or [Poison](rules/traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait")** Attempt a saving throw against the affliction at its current stage. On a failure, the affliction's stage doesn't increase, but you suffer the effects of the stage you were already on. On a critical failure, the stage only increases by 1.

**[Persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage)** Attempt a DC 10 flat check to recover from the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
