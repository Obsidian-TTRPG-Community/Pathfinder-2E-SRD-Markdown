# Solar Rejuvenation  *Feat 9*  
[leshy](rules/traits/leshy-b1.md "Leshy Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


If you rest outdoors for 10 minutes during the day, you regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier Ã— half your level. You gain this benefit in addition to any healing from [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md). Leshies whose plant nourishment does not rely on photosynthesis require a similarly suitable environment. For example, fungus leshies need dark, damp environments and a pile of decaying plant matter.
