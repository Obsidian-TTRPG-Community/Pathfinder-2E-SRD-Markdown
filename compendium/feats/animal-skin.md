# Animal Skin  *Feat 6*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [instinct](rules/traits/instinct.md "Instinct Action & Ability Trait")  [morph](rules/traits/morph.md "Morph Effect Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Animal instinct

Your proficiency in unarmored defense increases to expert. While you are raging and unarmored, your skin transforms into a thick hide resembling your animal's skin. You gain a +1 status bonus to AC instead of taking a â€“1 penalty to AC; if you have the greater juggernaut|Barbarian||13 class feature, this status bonus increases to +2. The thickness of your hide gives you a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +3.
