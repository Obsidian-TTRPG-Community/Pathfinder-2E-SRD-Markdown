- **Activity** Two-Action

A healing wave splashes across creatures in a 30-foot cone, its cleansing water driving afflictions from the body. Each creature in the area regains `3d8` Hit Points and can attempt a new save against one poison or disease affliction affecting it; on a failed save, the condition doesn't worsen. Each creature that benefited from this impulse becomes temporarily immune to Torrent in the Blood for 10 minutes.
