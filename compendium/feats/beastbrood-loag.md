# Beastbrood  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  [tiefling](rules/traits/tiefling-b1.md "Tiefling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


One of your ancestors was a [rakshasa](rules/traits/rakshasa-b1.md "Rakshasa Creature Trait"), the corrupt and aristocratic reincarnated souls that call Golarion home. You have some dim echo of your ancestor's memoriesâ€”enough to play the role of noble as needed, no matter your origins. You're trained in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society). If you're already trained in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the [Courtly Graces](compendium/feats/courtly-graces.md) skill feat.

## Beastbrood leads to...

[Reveal Hidden Self](compendium/feats/reveal-hidden-self-loil.md), [Jalmeri Rakshasa Magic](compendium/feats/jalmeri-rakshasa-magic-loil.md), [Idol Threat](compendium/feats/idol-threat-loil.md), [Rakshasa Magic](compendium/feats/rakshasa-magic-loag.md)
