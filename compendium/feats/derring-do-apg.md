# Derring-do  *Feat 10*  
[fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md "Swashbuckler Class Trait")  


When you compound panache with even more derring-do, it somehow tends to work out. When you already have panache, you can roll twice and use the higher result on checks to which the circumstance bonus for having panache applies ([Tumble Through](rules/actions/tumble-through.md) and any skill actions listed in your swashbuckler's style).
