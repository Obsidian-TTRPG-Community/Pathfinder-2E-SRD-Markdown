# Spark Fist  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 5*  
[dwarf](rules/traits/dwarf.md "Dwarf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.
- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)
- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Activity** Single Action

You dust explosive black powder on your fist or glove before attacking, which combusts as you hit an opponent.

The resulting pops of flame harm both you and your enemy.

Until the end of your next turn, your fist loses the [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait") trait and deals an additional 1 fire damage on a successful [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). Each time you succeed on a fist [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), you take 1 fire damage. If your fist would deal more than one weapon damage die, the fire damage dealt on a successful [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), to both you and your opponent, is equal to the number of weapon damage dice.
