# Elucidating Mercy  *Feat 10*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mercy](compendium/feats/mercy.md)

Your mercy grants clarity to those around you just when they need it most. When you use Mercy, you can instead attempt a counteract check to remove the [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused) or [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) conditions, using the source of that condition to determine the counteract level and DC. If the condition was caused by an ongoing effect and you don't remove that effect, the condition returns at the end of your next turn.
