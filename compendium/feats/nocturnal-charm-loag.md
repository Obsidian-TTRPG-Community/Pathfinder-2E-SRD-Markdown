# Nocturnal Charm  *Feat 1*  
[dhampir](rules/traits/dhampir-b1.md "Dhampir Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


The supernatural charm of your vampiric progenitor hangs about you, and you've learned to use it on mortals. Against humanoids (or other creatures of your type, if you're not a humanoid), you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks to [Lie](rules/actions/lie.md), and to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks to [Gather Information](rules/actions/gather-information.md) and [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md).
