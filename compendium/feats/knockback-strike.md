# Knockback Strike  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You focus your strength into a blow powerful enough to push an enemy away from you. Make an unarmed [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). If you hit, attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) the target. This attack uses the same multiple attack penalty as your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.
