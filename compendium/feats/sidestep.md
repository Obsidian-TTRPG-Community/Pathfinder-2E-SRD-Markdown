# Sidestep  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Trigger** The attack roll for a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) targeting you fails or critically fails.
- **Activity** Reaction

You deftly step out of the way of an attack, letting the blow continue to the creature next to you. You redirect the attack to a creature of your choice that is adjacent to you and within the reach of the triggering attack. The attacker rerolls the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)'s attack roll against the new target.
