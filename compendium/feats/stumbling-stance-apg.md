# Stumbling Stance  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception)
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a seemingly unfocused stance that mimics the movements of the inebriatedâ€”bobbing, weaving, leaving false openings, and distracting your enemies from your true movements. While in this stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks to [Feint](rules/actions/feint.md). The only [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) you can make are stumbling swing unarmed attacks. These deal `1d8` bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait"), [backstabber](rules/traits/backstabber.md "Backstabber Weapon Trait"), [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait"), [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait"), and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits. If an enemy hits you with a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) while in this stance, it becomes [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the next stumbling swing [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) you make against it before the end of your next turn.
