[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Activity** Single Action

You can cast your spells effortlessly by tapping into the leylines of the world. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) of 5th level or lower that has no duration, you don't expend the prepared spell as you cast it.
