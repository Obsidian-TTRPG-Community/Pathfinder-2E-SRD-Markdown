[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](compendium/feats/spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md)

When you cast [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md) heightened to at least 4th level, you can modify the spell to add the following to its standard effects: Your [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md) leaves behind a brief cloud of smoke in its area. While it's smoke instead of mist, this cloud otherwise has the effects of [obscuring mist](compendium/spells/obscuring-mist.md), except that it lasts only 1 round.

## Smoldering Explosion leads to...
