# Command Elemental  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[impulse](rules/traits/impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](rules/traits/kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You grasp the animating force within an elemental creature and bend it to your will. Choose a trait matching one of your kinetic elements and target an elemental creature within 30 feet that has the chosen trait. The elemental becomes [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by you if its level is equal to or lower than your level — 3, or [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for as long as you Sustain the effect if its level is equal to your level — 2 or higher. It can attempt a Will saving throw against your class DC to resist being [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by you or to end the [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) effect. If the target is already under someone else's command, it can't be [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) by this ability, and the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw, with the elemental using the better result.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The elemental creature is [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) or [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) as long as you Sustain the impulse, up to 1 minute. This effect ends if you or an ally attacks the elemental.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but you can Sustain the impulse up to 1 hour.
