# Crushing Grab  *Feat 2*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  


Like a powerful constrictor, you crush targets in your unyielding grasp. When you successfully [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) a creature, you can deal bludgeoning damage to that creature equal to your Strength modifier. You can make this attack [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait") with no penalty.
