# Strix Lore  *Feat 1*  
[strix](rules/traits/strix-loag.md "Strix Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You're well connected to your tribe and perhaps even strix communities beyond your own, where you've learned about the land and techniques of graceful movement. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) and [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Strix Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).
