# Morph-Risen  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  [reflection](rules/traits/reflection-da.md)  


You were once a shapeshifter or spellcaster using polymorph magic, but something went wrong, and you became trapped in the form of the creature you were imitating. This accident might have [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) your power, or you might have retained some of your skills, but either way, your form resists further forced transformation. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md) effects, and if you roll a success on a saving throw against a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) [morph](rules/traits/morph.md) or [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md) effect, you get a critical success instead.

## Morph-Risen leads to...
