# Storm Retribution  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Storm order, [tempest surge](compendium/spells/tempest-surge.md) order spell
- **Trigger** An opponent adjacent to you critically hits you with a melee weapon or melee unarmed attack.
- **Requirements**: You have at least 1 available Focus Point.
- **Activity** Reaction

You lash out, directing a burst of storming fury toward a creature that has harmed you. You cast [tempest surge](compendium/spells/tempest-surge.md) on the triggering opponent and push that creature, moving it 5 feet away from you if it fails its Reflex save, or 10 feet if it critically fails. This movement is forced movement.
