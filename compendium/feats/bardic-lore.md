# Bardic Lore  *Feat 1*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Enigma muse

Your studies make you informed on every subject. You are trained in [Bardic Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), a special [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill that can be used only to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), but on any topic. If you have legendary proficiency in [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), you gain expert proficiency in [Bardic Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), but you can't increase your proficiency rank in [Bardic Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) by any other means.
