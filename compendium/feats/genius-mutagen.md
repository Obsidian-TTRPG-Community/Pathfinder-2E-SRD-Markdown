# Genius Mutagen  *Feat 16*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md "Alchemist Class Trait")  


Specialized tweaks to your formula that supplements your genius considerably broaden the benefits you gain from cognitive mutagens. When you're affected by a cognitive mutagen, you also gain the mutagen's item bonus to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine), [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance), [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion), and [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) checks. In addition, you can communicate telepathically with creatures within 60 feet with whom you share a language. The communication is two-way once you establish it, so a creature you contact can also communicate with you.
