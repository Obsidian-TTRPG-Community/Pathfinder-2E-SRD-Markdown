# Soulsight (Sorcerer)  *Feat 8*  
[sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md "Sorcerer Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: bloodline that grants divine or occult spells

The spiritual essence in your blood has opened your senses to the world beyond. You gain spiritsense as an imprecise sense with a range of 60 feet. Spiritsense allows you to sense the spirits of creatures within the listed range, including living creatures, most non-mindless undead, and haunts. As with your hearing and other imprecise senses, you still need to [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) to locate an [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) creature. As spiritsense detects spiritual essence, not physical bodies, it can detect spirits projected by spells such as project image or possessing otherwise soulless objects. It can't detect soulless bodies, constructs, or objects, and like most senses, it doesn't penetrate through solid objects.
