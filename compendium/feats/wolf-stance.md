# Wolf Stance  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter the stance of a wolf, low to the ground with your hands held like fanged teeth. You can make wolf jaw unarmed attacks. These deal `1d8` piercing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait"), [backstabber](rules/traits/backstabber.md "Backstabber Weapon Trait"), [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait"), [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait"), and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits.

If you're flanking a target while in Wolf Stance, your wolf jaw unarmed attacks also gain the [trip](rules/traits/trip.md "Trip Weapon Trait") trait.

## Wolf Stance leads to...
