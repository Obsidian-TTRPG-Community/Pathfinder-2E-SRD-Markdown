[poppet](rules/traits/poppet-lotgb.md "Poppet Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You touch a creature with the [minion](rules/traits/minion.md "Minion Creature Trait") trait and share the heightened sense of autonomy you've discovered. The minion is [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) for 1 round and is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. It can use this extra action to [Step](rules/actions/step.md), [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), or [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
