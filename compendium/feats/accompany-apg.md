# Accompany  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md)  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

- **Trigger** An ally within 30 feet [Casts a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

You use your performances to supplement an ally's spellcasting, providing magical energy for their spells. Attempt a [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check, [using a very high DC for the ally's level](rules/tables/dcs-by-level.md), and either spend a Focus Point (if the triggering spell is a focus spell) or expend a spell slot at least 1 level higher than the triggering spell. If you succeed at the [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check, your ally's spell doesn't cost the Focus Point or spell slot.
