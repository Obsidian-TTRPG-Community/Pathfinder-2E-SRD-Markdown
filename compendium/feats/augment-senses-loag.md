# Augment Senses  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 13*  
[fleshwarp](rules/traits/fleshwarp-loag.md "Fleshwarp Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You open vestigial eyes, unfurl tympanic flaps of skin, or otherwise enhance your senses. Until the start of your next turn, you gain the following benefits: you can't be flanked; when you [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) for creatures, you can scan a 60-foot cone or a 30-foot burst instead of the normal area; and when you [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) for [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) objects, you can search a 15-foot square instead of the normal area.
