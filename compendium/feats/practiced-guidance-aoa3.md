# Practiced Guidance  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bellflower Dedication](compendium/feats/bellflower-dedication-aoa3.md)

Making one's way to safety can be harrowing, but you have extensive practice at helping others along that path. When you roll a success to [Aid](rules/actions/aid.md) a member of your crop, you get a critical success instead.
