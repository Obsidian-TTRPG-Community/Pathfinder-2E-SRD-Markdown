# Magical Adaptation  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Horizon Walker Dedication](compendium/feats/horizon-walker-dedication-apg.md)

When an obstacle bars your path, you pull a trick from your sleeve to overcome it. You can cast [darkvision](compendium/spells/darkvision.md), [spider climb](compendium/spells/spider-climb.md), and 4th-level [water breathing](compendium/spells/water-breathing.md) as innate primal spells, each once per day.
