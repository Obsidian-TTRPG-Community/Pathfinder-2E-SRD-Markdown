- **Prerequisites**: vivacious speed
- **Requirements**: You have panache.
- **Activity** Single Action

You move so quickly that you create a short-lived afterimage, looks exactly like you, in front of you or behind you. You [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md). At any point along your movement, you leave an afterimage of yourself behind.

Alternatively, you can stop moving and send your afterimage forward instead, up to the remainder of your Speed. A creature that spends actions to engage with your afterimage can attempt to 0 with a Will save against your class DC. Once an enemy has 0 any of your afterimages, they are temporarily immune to all of your Vivacious Afterimages for 10 minutes. As long as a creature has not 0, the afterimage counts as a creature for flanking. The afterimage lasts until the beginning of your next turn or until you use Vivacious Afterimage again, whichever comes first.
