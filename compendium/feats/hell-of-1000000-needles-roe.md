- **Activity** Three-Action

The landscape fills with monumental filaments of metal. The needles lance into a cube 30 feet on a side within 500 feet. Each creature in the area takes `13d6` piercing damage, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. Each creature that fails its save is impaled, becoming [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) until it Escapes (the DC is your class DC); a creature that critically failed is also off-guard as long as it's impaled. The hell remains until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute. Using this impulse again ends any previous one. The first time you Sustain it each round, lightning crisscrosses the needles. Each creature in the area takes `3d12` electricity damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. Squares in the area are hazardous terrain. A creature takes 6 piercing damage for every square of the area it moves through.
