# Disruptive Stance  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

The slightest distraction can provoke your wrath, and you're prepared to foil enemies' actions. As long as you are in this stance, you can use [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md) when a creature within your reach uses a concentrate action, in addition to manipulate and move actions. Furthermore, you disrupt a triggering concentrate or manipulate action if your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) hits (not only if it's a critical hit).
