# Shared Clarity  *Feat 18*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Premonition of Clarity](compendium/feats/premonition-of-clarity-apg.md)

You can project your premonitions of clarity to your allies. When you use [Premonition of Clarity](compendium/feats/premonition-of-clarity-apg.md), allies within 15 feet of you who failed the same saving throw against the same [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect can also spend their reactions to reroll the failed saving throw with a +2 circumstance bonus.
