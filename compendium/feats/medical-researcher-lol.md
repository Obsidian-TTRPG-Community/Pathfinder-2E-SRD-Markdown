# Medical Researcher  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine)

Kassi has taught you not only how to apply medicines with your medical skills but how to craft them as well. When you [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) healer's kits, vaccines, addiction suppressants, antidotes, antiplagues, elixirs of life, or other non-magical medical or healing items, you can use [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) instead of [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting).
