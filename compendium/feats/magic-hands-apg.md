# Magic Hands  *Feat 6*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Healing Hands](compendium/feats/healing-hands.md)

The blessing of your deity heightens your healing ability, making your mundane healing work as if by magic. When you succeed at a [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check to [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md), your action gains the [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait") trait and you heal the maximum amount for the `2d8` (or `4d8` on a critical success). If you have an ability that adds additional dice to your [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md), you still roll those normally.
