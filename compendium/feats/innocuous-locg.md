# Innocuous  *Feat 1*  
[halfling](rules/traits/halfling.md "Halfling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Halflings have been unobtrusive assistants of larger folk for untold ages, and your people count on this assumption of innocence. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) (or another skill of your choice, if you're already trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception))

If you fail a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check to [Create a Diversion](rules/actions/create-a-diversion.md), humanoid creatures aren't aware that you were trying to trick them unless you get a critical failure on your roll.
