# Trick Driver Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  


You are equally at home piloting any vehicle, adapting yourself instantly to varied controls, movements, and handling.

Whenever piloting a vehicle requires a [Piloting Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) or [Sailing Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check, you can use your [Driving Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) proficiency instead.

You can use Dexterity in place of Intelligence when attempting piloting checks with [Driving Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore). You become an expert in [Driving Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore). At 7th level, you become a master in [Driving Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), and at 15th level, you become legendary in [Driving Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the trick driver archetype.

## Trick Driver Dedication leads to...

[Drive-by Attack](compendium/feats/drive-by-attack-g-g.md), [Express Driver](compendium/feats/express-driver-g-g.md), [Power Slide](compendium/feats/power-slide-g-g.md), [Push It](compendium/feats/push-it-g-g.md), [Roadkill](compendium/feats/roadkill-g-g.md), [Take The Wheel](compendium/feats/take-the-wheel-g-g.md)
