# Slippery Secrets  *Feat 7*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception)

You elude and evade attempts to uncover your true nature or intentions. When a spell or [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) effect tries to read your mind, detect whether you are lying, or reveal your alignment, you can attempt a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check against the spell or effect's DC. If you succeed, the effect reveals nothing.
