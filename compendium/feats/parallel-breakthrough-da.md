# Parallel Breakthrough  *Feat 6*  
[psychic](rules/traits/psychic-da.md "Psychic Class Trait")  


You expand your mind beyond your area of psychic specialty. You gain a 1st-level psi cantrip for a conscious mind other than your own; this can be either the unique surface cantrip or one of the common cantrips and the accompanying amp. If you choose a common cantrip, you also gain the special benefit granted by that conscious mind when casting the cantrip without an amp. You don't gain any other benefits of that conscious mind, such as additional spells known.
