# First World Magic  *Feat 1*  
[gnome](rules/traits/gnome.md "Gnome Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your connection to the First World grants you a primal innate spell, much like those of the fey. Choose one cantrip from the primal spell list. You can cast this spell as a primal innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
