# Goloma Courage  *Feat 1*  
[goloma](rules/traits/goloma-lome.md "Goloma Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


The most important thing you've learned living with fear is how to overcome it. When you roll a success on a saving throw against a [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effect, you get a critical success instead. In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saves against [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effects and a +2 circumstance bonus to your Will DC against attempts to [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md) you.
