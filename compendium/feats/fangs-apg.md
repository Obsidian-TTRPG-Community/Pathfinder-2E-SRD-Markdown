# Fangs  *Feat 1*  
[dhampir](rules/traits/dhampir-b1.md)  


Your incisors have grown into true fangs: long, sharp, and well-suited to drawing blood. You gain a fangs unarmed attack that deals `1d6` piercing damage. Your fangs are in the brawling group and have the [grapple](rules/traits/grapple.md) and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.
