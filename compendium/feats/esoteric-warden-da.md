# Esoteric Warden  *Feat 2*  
[thaumaturge](rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md "Thaumaturge Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Exploit Vulnerability](rules/actions/exploit-vulnerability-da.md)

When you apply antithetical material against a creature successfully, you also ward yourself against its next attacks. When you succeed at your check to Exploit a Vulnerability, you gain a +1 status bonus to your AC against the creature's next attack and a +1 status bonus to your next saving throw against the creature; if you critically succeed, these bonuses are +2 instead. You can gain these bonuses only once per day against a particular creature, and the benefit ends if you [Exploit Vulnerability](rules/actions/exploit-vulnerability-da.md) again.
