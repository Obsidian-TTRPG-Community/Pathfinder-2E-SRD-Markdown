# Icy Apotheosis  *Feat 20*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  


You are as much a creature of cold as whatever ancestry you were born to. You are immune to cold damage and gain the [cold](rules/traits/cold.md) trait. You automatically succeed on saving throws against effects that have the [cold](rules/traits/cold.md) trait.
