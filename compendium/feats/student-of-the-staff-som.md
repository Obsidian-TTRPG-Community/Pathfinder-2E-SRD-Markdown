# Student Of The Staff  *Feat 4*  
[magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md), twisting tree hybrid study

You've studied the staff extensively to learn the hidden capabilities of your chosen weapon. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using a staff, you apply the critical specialization effect of the club group. While you're in [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md) stance, your staff gains the [deadly <d6>](rules/traits/deadly.md) trait, with the damage from the deadly die being the same damage type as the extra damage from [Arcane Cascade](rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md).

In addition, you can place property runes into a magic staff you prepare, even though a magic staff can't typically hold property runes. You must first inscribe the property runes into your spellbook, using the same process as transferring a rune (Core Rulebook 580). The rune takes the form of a specialized diagram in your spellbook, occupying one page. You can't inscribe runes that can't be placed on a non-magical staff, nor can you inscribe the [shifting](compendium/equipment/items/shifting.md) rune. When you prepare a staff, you can impart any number of property runes from your spellbook into the staff, up to the limit imposed by the staff's [weapon potency](compendium/equipment/items/weapon-potency.md) rune.
