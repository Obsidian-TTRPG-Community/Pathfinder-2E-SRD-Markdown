- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Activity** Single Action

Your inborn magical nature lets you redirect ambient energies to fuel your spells. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) of 5th level or lower that has no duration, you don't expend the spell's slot when you cast it.
