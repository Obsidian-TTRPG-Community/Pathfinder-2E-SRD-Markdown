# Oatia Skysage Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism)

Your study of the stars unlocks supernatural insights and magic. You either become trained in [Astronomy Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) or an expert in [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism).

You learn to cast spontaneous spells and gain the [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) activity. You gain a spell repertoire with two common cantrips of your choice; these cantrips can be from any spell tradition, but they must be divination spells. You cast these spells as occult spells as you draw on the stars and night sky. You're trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs. If you have a hand free and you've gazed at the night sky in the last 24 hours, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Intelligence.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Oatia skysage archetype.
