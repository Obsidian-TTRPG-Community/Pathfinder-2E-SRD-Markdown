# Yamaraj's Grandeur  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 17*  
[duskwalker](rules/traits/duskwalker-apg.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You have been granted a sliver of the power of the yamaraj, the magistrates of the dead who agreed to allow duskwalkers to exist at all. You exhale a blast of icy wind and ravenous insects. This is a 30-foot cone that deals `14d6` slashing damage and `4d6` [persistent slashing damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) (basic Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). On a critical failure, targets also become [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
