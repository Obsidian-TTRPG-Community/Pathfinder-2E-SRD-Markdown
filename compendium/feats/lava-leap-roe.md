- **Activity** Two-Action

You wreath yourself in molten stone and hurtle toward your enemy. [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) up to your Speed. At the end of your [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md), a wave of lava crashes onto all creatures in a 10-foot emanation. Each creature in the area takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage and `2d6` fire damage, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC.

The cooling remains of the lava form a temporary protective shell around you, granting you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

Level (+3) Each type of damage increases by `1d6`.
