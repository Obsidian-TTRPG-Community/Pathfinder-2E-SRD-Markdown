# Leap And Fire  *Feat 8*  
[gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hit the Dirt!](compendium/feats/hit-the-dirt-g-g.md)

You're quick enough to line up a shot even while diving to the ground. When you use your Hit the Dirt! reaction, at any point during your [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) you can also make a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a loaded firearm or crossbow, targeting the creature whose attack triggered the reaction.
