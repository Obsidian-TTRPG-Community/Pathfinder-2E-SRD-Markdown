# Agile Grace  *Feat 10*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  


Your graceful moves with agile weapons are beyond compare. Your multiple attack penalty with [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait") weapons and [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait") unarmed attacks becomes –3 for your second attack and –6 for subsequent attacks (rather than –4 and –8).
