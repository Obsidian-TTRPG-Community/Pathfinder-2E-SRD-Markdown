# Sacral Lord  *Feat 4*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md "Oracle Class Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion)

By right of ritual or sheer stubbornness, you have claimed rulership of the land. Claim a defined territory, such as a small section of forest or river, or a district of a larger city. Within its borders, you can cast [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md), guidance, and sigil as innate divine cantrips, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on creatures that have the celestial, fiend, fey, [monitor](rules/traits/monitor.md "Monitor Creature Type Trait"), or [spirit](rules/traits/spirit.md "Spirit Creature Trait") traits.

**Special.** You and your land are linked. Changes to one mirror themselves on the otherâ€”if you're depressed, gray rain and clammy mist might set in. These effects have no immediate mechanical impact, but they might give clues about problems afflicting the land.
