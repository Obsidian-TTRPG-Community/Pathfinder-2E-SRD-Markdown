# Sly Striker  *Feat 8*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: sneak attack

Your attacks deal more damage, even against creatures that aren't [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed). When you succeed or critically succeed at a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a creature that isn't [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed), you also deal `1d6` precision damage. This applies only if you're using a weapon or unarmed attack you could deal sneak attack damage with. At 14th level, if you would normally deal `3d6` or more sneak attack damage to [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) creatures, you deal `2d6` precision damage to creatures that aren't [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed).
