# Clan's Edge  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 1*  
[dwarf](rules/traits/dwarf.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in clan daggers
- **Activity** Two-Action

By moving your clan dagger with rapid precision, you can protect yourself more effectively. Make two clan dagger [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) against different targets. Your multiple attack penalty applies normally to these [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md). You then use an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to gain the +1 circumstance bonus to your AC from your clan dagger's parrying trait.

## Clan's Edge leads to...
