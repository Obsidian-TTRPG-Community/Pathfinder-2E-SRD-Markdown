[aphorite](rules/traits/aphorite-loag.md "Aphorite Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You've learned to disperse the crystalline motes coating your body as a haze. You become [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed), though you can't use this concealment to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md), as normal for concealment where your position is still obvious. The motes stay within an inch of your skin, move with you, and last for a number of rounds equal to half your level.

## Crystalline Dust leads to...

[Ancillary Motes](compendium/feats/ancillary-motes-loag.md), [Crystalline Cloud](compendium/feats/crystalline-cloud-loag.md)
