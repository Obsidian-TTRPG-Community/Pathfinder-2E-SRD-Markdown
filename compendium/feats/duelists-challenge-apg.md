# Duelist's Challenge  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [open](rules/traits/open.md "Open Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Duelist Dedication](compendium/feats/duelist-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

Select one foe that you can see and proclaim a challenge. That foe is your dueling opponent until they are defeated, flee, or the encounter ends. Any time you hit that enemy using a single one-handed melee weapon while your other hand or hands are free, you gain a circumstance bonus to the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)'s damage equal to the number of damage dice your weapon deals.

If you attack a creature other than your dueling opponent, you take a circumstance penalty to damage equal to the number of damage dice your weapon deals.
