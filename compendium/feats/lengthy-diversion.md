# Lengthy Diversion  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception)

When you critically succeed to [Create a Diversion](rules/actions/create-a-diversion.md), you continue to remain [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) after the end of your turn. This effect lasts for an amount of time that depends on the diversion and situation, as determined by the GM (minimum 1 additional round).
