# Ferocious Beasts  *Feat 13*  
[orc](rules/traits/orc.md "Orc Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Beast Trainer](compendium/feats/beast-trainer-apg.md) or animal companion, [Orc Ferocity](compendium/feats/orc-ferocity.md)

Since ancient times, the mightiest orc beast tamers would draw out the true fighting spirit of their companion beasts by feeding the creatures a draft incorporating the orc's own blood. Animal companions or bonded animals you have gain the [Orc Ferocity](compendium/feats/orc-ferocity.md) feat, and they gain a reaction they can use only for [Orc Ferocity](compendium/feats/orc-ferocity.md). If you have the [Undying Ferocity](compendium/feats/undying-ferocity-apg.md) ancestry feat, all animal companions or bonded animals you have also gain the benefits of that feat when using the [Orc Ferocity](compendium/feats/orc-ferocity.md) reaction.
