# Gaping Flesh  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 5*  
[fleshwarp](rules/traits/fleshwarp-loag.md "Fleshwarp Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** A creature you are aware of damages you with a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

Your wound yawns open, appalling your attacker. The attacker must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or become [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) ([sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) on a critical failure). It can't recover from the [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition while it's adjacent to you.
