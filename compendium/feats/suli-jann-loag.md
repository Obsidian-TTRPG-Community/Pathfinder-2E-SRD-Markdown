# Suli-jann  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  [suli](rules/traits/suli-b2.md "Suli Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your elemental ancestor was a janni, genies that walk the mortal world and embody all four elements together. You inherited a janni's nature as a wanderer and ability to survive in many types of environment, from the hottest desert to the coldest tundra.

You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival). If you would automatically become trained in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [Forager](compendium/feats/forager.md) skill feat as a bonus feat.
