# Equitable Defense  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Shieldmarshal Dedication](compendium/feats/shieldmarshal-dedication-loil.md)
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Trigger** You take damage from a critical hit.
- **Activity** Reaction

Gritting your teeth through the pain, you position yourself to counterattack. You gain resistance to the damage from the critical hit equal to half your level. As long as you're still conscious after the attack, you can [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to reload a weapon you currently wield or [Stand](rules/actions/stand.md). You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on the next [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) you make against the creature who critically hit you, provided you make it before the end of your next turn.
