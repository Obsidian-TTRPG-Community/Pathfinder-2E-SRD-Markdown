# Surprise Attack  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Assassin Dedication](compendium/feats/assassin-dedication-apg.md)

You act before foes can react. On the first round of combat, if you roll [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) for initiative, creatures that haven't acted are [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to you.
