# Solar Rejuvenation  *Feat 9*  
[ghoran](rules/traits/ghoran-loil.md)  


The warmth and light of the sun gives you life. If you rest outdoors for 10 minutes during the day, you regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier Ã— half your level. You gain this benefit in addition to any healing from [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md).
