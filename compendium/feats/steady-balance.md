# Steady Balance  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics)

You can keep your balance easily, even in adverse conditions. Whenever you roll a success using the [Balance](rules/actions/balance.md) action, you get a critical success instead. You're not [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) while attempting to [Balance](rules/actions/balance.md) on narrow surfaces and uneven ground. Thanks to your incredible balance, you can attempt an [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check instead of a Reflex save to [Grab an Edge](rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md).
