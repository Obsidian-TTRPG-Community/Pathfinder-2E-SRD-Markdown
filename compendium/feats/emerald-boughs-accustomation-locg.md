# Emerald Boughs Accustomation  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](compendium/feats/magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), Emerald Boughs affiliation, expert in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society)

You are comfortable and socially capable in almost any cultural context. When you use the [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) skill to [Subsist](rules/actions/subsist.md), if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead; if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead; and if you roll a critical success, you can provide for another additional creature. Furthermore, when you attempt a [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about cultural practices and roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
