[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: harmful font or healing font
- **Activity** Single Action

Your faith provides temporary protection in addition to healing. If the next action you use is to cast [harm](compendium/spells/harm.md) or [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) on a single target and the target regains Hit Points from the spell, it also gains a +2 status bonus to AC and saving throws for 1 round.
