# Familiar Foe  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](compendium/feats/lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md), expert in [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) or [Undead Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore)

You regularly face off against undead and can identify many with a glance. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on skill checks to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about undead. Whenever you roll a critical failure on a check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about undead, you get a failure instead.
