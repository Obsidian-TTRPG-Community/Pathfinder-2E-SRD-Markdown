# Insect Shape  *Feat 6*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Wild Shape](compendium/feats/wild-shape.md)

Your understanding of life expands, allowing you to mimic a wider range of creatures. Add the forms in [insect form](compendium/spells/insect-form.md) to your wild shape list. Whenever you use wild shape to polymorph into the non-flying insect form listed in pest form, the duration is 24 hours instead of 10 minutes.
