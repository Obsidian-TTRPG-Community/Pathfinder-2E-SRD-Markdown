# Dispelling Spellstrike  [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 16*  
[magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md "Magus Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md)
- **Requirements**: Your [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) is charged.
- **Activity** Three-Action

The spell you deliver tries to force out magic affecting your enemy. Make a [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md). If it hits, you also attempt to counteract a single spell (of your choice) active on the target. The counteract level is half your level rounded up, and the counteract check modifier is the standard modifier for counteracting with a spell (your Intelligence modifier plus your spellcasting proficiency bonus, plus any bonuses or penalties that specifically apply to counteract checks).
