# Dispelling Slice  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 16*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

Your sneak attack slices through the threads binding magic to a target. Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) creature (your choice). If your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) deals sneak attack damage, you attempt to counteract a single spell active on the target. Your counteract level is equal to half your level (rounded up), and your counteract check modifier is equal to your class DC â€“ 10.
