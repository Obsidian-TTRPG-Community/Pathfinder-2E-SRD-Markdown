# Dustsoul  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](rules/traits/lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  [oread](rules/traits/oread-b2.md "Oread Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your earth elemental ancestor's influence manifests in you as dust and dirt, like the soil of a field or the hot desert sands. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival). If you would automatically become trained in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can sustain yourself on dirt and ash instead of normal food and water.
