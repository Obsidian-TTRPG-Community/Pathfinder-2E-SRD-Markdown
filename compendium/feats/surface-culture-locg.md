# Surface Culture  *Feat 1*  
[dwarf](rules/traits/dwarf.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: any surface dwarf ethnicity

Your interactions with other cultures on the surface have not only taught you about many other ancestries, but have also helped you realize the value of your own. You gain the trained proficiency rank in the [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) skill (or another skill of your choice if you were already trained in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society)), and you gain the [Additional Lore](compendium/feats/additional-lore.md) skill feat for the [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) corresponding to your culture (for instance, [Ouat Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) or [Pahmet Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore)).
