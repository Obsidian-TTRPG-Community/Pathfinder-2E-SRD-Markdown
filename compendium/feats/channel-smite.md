# Channel Smite  [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: harmful font or healing font
- **Cost**: Expend a [harm](compendium/spells/harm.md) or [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) spell.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You siphon the destructive energies of positive or negative energy through a melee attack and into your foe. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) and add the spell's damage to the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)'s damage. This is negative damage if you expended a [harm](compendium/spells/harm.md) spell or positive damage if you expended a [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) spell. The spell is expended with no effect if your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) fails or hits a creature that isn't damaged by that energy type (such as if you hit a non-undead creature with a [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) spell).
