# Clever Counterspell  *Feat 12*  
[wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md "Wizard Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Counterspell](compendium/feats/counterspell-wizard.md), Quick Recognition

You creatively apply your prepared spells to [Counterspell](compendium/feats/counterspell-wizard.md) a much wider variety of your opponents' magic. Instead of being able to counter a foe's spell with [Counterspell](compendium/feats/counterspell-wizard.md) only if you have that same spell prepared, you can use [Counterspell](compendium/feats/counterspell-wizard.md) as long as you have the spell the foe is casting in your spellbook. When you use [Counterspell](compendium/feats/counterspell-wizard.md) in this way, the prepared spell you expend must share a trait other than its tradition with the triggering spell. At the GM's discretion, you can instead use a spell that has an opposing trait or that otherwise logically would counter the triggering spell (such as using a [cold](rules/traits/cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait") or [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") spell to counter [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md) or using [remove fear](compendium/spells/remove-fear.md) to counter a [fear](compendium/spells/fear.md) spell)

Regardless of what spell you expend, you take a â€“2 penalty to your counteract check, though the GM can waive this penalty if the expended spell is especially appropriate.
