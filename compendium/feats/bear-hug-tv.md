# Bear Hug  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: Your last action was a successful claw [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
- **Activity** Single Action

You snatch at your opponent with your claws, pulling them close in a ferocious bear hug. You make another claw [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the same target. If this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) hits, the target is also [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed).
