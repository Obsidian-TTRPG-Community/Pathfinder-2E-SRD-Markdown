# Natural Medicine  *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature)

You can apply natural cures to heal your allies. You can use [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature) instead of [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) to [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md). If you're in the wilderness, you might have easier access to fresh ingredients, allowing you to gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check to [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md) using [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), subject to the GM's determination.

## Natural Medicine leads to...

[Herbalist Dedication](compendium/feats/herbalist-dedication-apg.md), [Endemic Herbs](compendium/feats/endemic-herbs-apg.md), [Expert Herbalism](compendium/feats/expert-herbalism-apg.md), [Fresh Ingredients](compendium/feats/fresh-ingredients-apg.md), [Poultice Preparation](compendium/feats/poultice-preparation-apg.md), [Gravelands Herbalist](compendium/feats/gravelands-herbalist-lokl.md)
