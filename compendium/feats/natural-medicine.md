- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature)

You can apply natural cures to heal your allies. You can use [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature) instead of [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) to [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md). If you're in the wilderness, you might have easier access to fresh ingredients, allowing you to gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check to [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md) using [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), subject to the GM's determination.
