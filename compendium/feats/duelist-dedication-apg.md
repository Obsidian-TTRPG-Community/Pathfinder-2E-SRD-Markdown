# Duelist Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in light armor and simple weapons

You are always ready to draw your weapon and begin a duel, no matter the circumstances. You gain the [Quick Draw](compendium/feats/quick-draw-ranger.md) ranger feat, enabling you to both draw and attack with a weapon as 1 action. This serves as Quick Draw for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the duelist archetype.
