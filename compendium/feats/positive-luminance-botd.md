# Positive Luminance  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hallowed Necromancer Dedication](compendium/feats/hallowed-necromancer-dedication-botd.md)

You learn how to create a luminous reservoir of positive energy that you can use to punish undead who dare attack you. You gain the domain spell [positive luminance](compendium/spells/positive-luminance.md). It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) activity.
