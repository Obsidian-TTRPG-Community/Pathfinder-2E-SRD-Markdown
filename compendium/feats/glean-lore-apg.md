# Glean Lore  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md)  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md)  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  [secret](rules/traits/secret.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You tap into the collected lore of the divine, accessing a variety of potentially useful information. Attempt a [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) check to understand the information you gain. The GM sets the DC (similar to the DC to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md)), potentially adjusting the DC of the check for topics far removed from your mystery.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You comprehend the lore accurately or gain a useful clue from the divine about your situation.
> - **Success** You learn two pieces of information about the topic, one true and one erroneous, but you don't know which is which.
> - **Failure** You recall incorrect information or gain an erroneous or misleading clue.
> - **Critical Failure** You recall two pieces of incorrect information or gain two erroneous or misleading clues.
