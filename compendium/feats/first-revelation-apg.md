[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Oracle Dedication](compendium/feats/oracle-dedication-apg.md)

You gain your mystery's initial revelation spell. Casting this spell progresses your oracular curse|oracle|apg|1||curse. Use the minor curse from your mystery, but when you progress it again, instead of your mystery's moderate [curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait") effect, you become [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) in addition to the effects of the minor curse.

If you don't have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point.

You can [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) by reconciling the conflicting nature of your mystery, which also reduces your curse to minor.
