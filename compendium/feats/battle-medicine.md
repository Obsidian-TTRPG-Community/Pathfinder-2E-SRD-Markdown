# Battle Medicine  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[general](rules/traits/general.md "General Feat Trait")  [healing](rules/traits/healing.md "Healing Effect Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine)
- **Requirements**: You are holding or wearing [healer's tools](compendium/equipment/items/healers-tools.md) and have a hand free.
- **Activity** Single Action

You can patch up yourself or an adjacent ally, even in combat. Attempt a [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check with the same DC as for [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md), and restore a corresponding amount of Hit Points; this does not remove the [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition. As with [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md), you can attempt checks against higher DCs if you have the minimum proficiency rank. The target is then temporarily immune to your [Battle Medicine](compendium/feats/battle-medicine.md) for 1 day.

## Battle Medicine leads to...
