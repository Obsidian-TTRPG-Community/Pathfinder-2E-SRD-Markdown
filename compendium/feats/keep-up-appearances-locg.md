# Keep Up Appearances  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[human](rules/traits/human.md "Human Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: Taldan nationality
- **Trigger** You are affected by an [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effect.
- **Activity** Reaction

Taldan pride means you never show weakness. Roll a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check and compare the result to any observing creatures' [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DCs. On a success, that creature believes you were unaffected by the [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effect. A creature tricked in this manner can't benefit from the [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effect and can't use abilities that require you to be under this [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effect; for example, if you successfully use this ability to trick a will-o'-wisp into believing you aren't under a [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effect, it can't use its Feed on Fear ability on you.
