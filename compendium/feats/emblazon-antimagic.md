# Emblazon Antimagic  *Feat 12*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Emblazon Armament](compendium/feats/emblazon-armament.md)

Your deity's symbol protects against offensive magic. When you [Emblazon an Armament](compendium/feats/emblazon-armament.md), you can choose from the following effects instead of the effects listed in that feat.

These effects have the same restrictions as the base options.

- **Shield** When the wielder has the [shield raised](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md), they gain the shield's circumstance bonus to saving throws against magic, and they can use [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) against damage from their enemies' spells.
- **Weapon** When the weapon's wielder critically hits with the weapon, they can attempt to counteract a spell on their target, using your counteract level is equal to half your level, rounded up. If they attempt to do so, the emblazoned symbol immediately disappears.
