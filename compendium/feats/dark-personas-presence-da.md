# Dark Persona's Presence  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 8*  
[aura](rules/traits/aura.md "Aura Combat Trait")  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [psychic](rules/traits/psychic-da.md "Psychic Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** You [Unleash your Psyche](rules/actions/unleash-psyche-da.md).
- **Activity** Free Action

When you [Unleash your Psyche](rules/actions/unleash-psyche-da.md), all your rage and pain—the portion of your psyche dedicated to cruel retribution—come along with it.

The force of your dark persona's negativity batters constantly against all creatures in a 30-foot emanation when you [Unleash your Psyche](rules/actions/unleash-psyche-da.md) and for as long as your [Psyche is Unleashed](rules/actions/unleash-psyche-da.md). A creature must attempt a Will save against your spell DC the first time it enters the emanation, or if it's in the emanation when you take this action; it doesn't need to attempt a save again, even if it leaves the emanation and returns. A creature [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) by your Dark Persona's Presence can't decrease its [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) value below 1 while within the emanation.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Failure** The target is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
>
>    While your [Psyche is Unleashed](rules/actions/unleash-psyche-da.md), your dark persona cares only for destruction. You can [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) only if it can directly damage an enemy or object or can impose a detrimental condition or penalty on one.
