# Animal Trainer Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Trained in [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature)

You gain the services of a young animal companion that travels with you and obeys simple commands as best as it can. This trained animal is trained in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) instead of the skill listed for its type.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the animal trainer archetype.

## Animal Trainer Dedication leads to...

[Beast Speaker](compendium/feats/beast-speaker-ec2.md), [Mature Trained Companion](compendium/feats/mature-trained-companion-ec2.md), [Splendid Companion](compendium/feats/splendid-companion-ec2.md), [Specialized Companion](compendium/feats/specialized-companion-ec2.md)
