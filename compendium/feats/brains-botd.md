# Brains!  [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Feast](compendium/feats/feast-botd.md)
- **Trigger** You Feast upon a humanoid's brain. The humanoid can't be [mindless](rules/traits/mindless.md "Mindless Creature Trait") (or, if you're Feasting on a corpse, can't have been mindless while alive).
- **Activity** Free Action

You consume the brains of your foe, causing synapses long rotten to fire and enabling you to shake off your mental torpor. You gain a +1 status bonus on skill checks to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) for 1 hour. If the humanoid had a higher modifier to the skill check you're using to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) than you do, the status bonus increases to +2.
