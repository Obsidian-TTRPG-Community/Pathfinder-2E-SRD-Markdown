# Distracting Flattery  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dandy Dedication](compendium/feats/dandy-dedication-apg.md), expert in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception)
- **Trigger** You observe a target's attitude toward yourself or your allies decrease as a result of an ally's behavior.
- **Activity** Reaction

You know how to maintain a good impression and manage your image, even while keeping uncouth company.

Make a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check against the target's Will DC. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your Distracting Flattery for 10 minutes.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target's attitude doesn't decrease as a result of your ally's social blunder.
> - **Failure** The target's attitude decreases, as normal.
> - **Critical Failure** Your attempt makes matters worse, decreasing the target's attitude toward you by one step, in addition to any changes from the behavior that triggered this reaction.
