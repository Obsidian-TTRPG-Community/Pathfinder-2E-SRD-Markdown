# Ghostly Grasp  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ghost Dedication](compendium/feats/ghost-dedication-botd.md)

Your control over your ghostly form grows. You gain the advanced undead benefits (page 44) and can interact with physical objects, with limits. You can attempt Strength-based skill checks against physical creatures and objects. You can [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) with physical objects, but the action has no effect unless you succeed at a DC 20 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) or DC 20 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check.
