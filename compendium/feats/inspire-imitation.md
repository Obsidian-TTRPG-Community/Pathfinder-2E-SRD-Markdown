# Inspire Imitation  *Feat 5*  
[half-elf](rules/traits/half-elf.md)  


Your own actions inspire your allies to great achievements. Whenever you critically succeed at a skill check, you automatically qualify to use the [Aid](rules/actions/aid.md) reaction when attempting to help an ally using the same skill, even without spending an action to prepare to do so.
