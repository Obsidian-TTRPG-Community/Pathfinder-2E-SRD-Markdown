# Lion Blade Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: You are from Taldor.
- **Prerequisites**: member of the Lion Blades, trained in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance)

Your lion blade spy training helps you conceal yourself and your identity. You become trained in your choice of [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) and in [Espionage Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You never take circumstance penalties for attempting to take a disguise of a different ancestry, age, and so on, as long as the disguised form is appropriate for your size.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Lion Blade archetype.

## Lion Blade Dedication leads to...

[Expeditious Advance](compendium/feats/expeditious-advance-lowg.md), [Flicker](compendium/feats/flicker-lowg.md), [Lost In The Crowd](compendium/feats/lost-in-the-crowd-lowg.md), [Crowd Mastery](compendium/feats/crowd-mastery-lowg.md), [Spy's Countermeasures](compendium/feats/spys-countermeasures-lowg.md)
