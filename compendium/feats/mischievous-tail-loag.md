# Mischievous Tail  *Feat 13*  
[ganzi](rules/traits/ganzi-loag.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Skillful Tail](compendium/feats/skillful-tail-ganzi-loag.md)

Your tail can bedevil your foes. You can [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) and [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) creatures with your tail, even if you don't have a free hand. All restrictions of [Skillful Tail](compendium/feats/skillful-tail-ganzi-loag.md) otherwise continue to apply. If you have [Smashing Tail](compendium/feats/smashing-tail-loag.md), your tail unarmed attack gains the [disarm](rules/traits/disarm.md) and [trip](rules/traits/trip.md) traits.
