# Grove-Harbored  *Feat 1*  
ardande  


You are accustomed to exploring thick woodlands and defending yourself against the attacks of magical plants. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against plant, poison, and wood effects, and if you roll a success on a save against a [poison](rules/traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait") effect, you get a critical success instead.
