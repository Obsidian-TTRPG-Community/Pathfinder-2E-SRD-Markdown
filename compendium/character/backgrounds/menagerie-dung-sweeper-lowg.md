# Menagerie Dung Sweeper
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 22*  

Whether you washed warrior beasts below the Irorium's arena floor or tended to the mutated animals of a Puddle sideshow, you are experienced with all manner of weird wildlife.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature) skill and the [Animal Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Train Animal](compendium/feats/train-animal.md) skill feat.
