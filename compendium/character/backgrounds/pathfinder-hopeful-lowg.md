# Pathfinder Hopeful
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 22*  

You've long wanted to join the adventurous Pathfinder Society.

You have taken up the dangerous life of an adventurer in hopes of earning a spot among the Pathfinders.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) skill and the [Pathfinder Society Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Additional Lore](compendium/feats/additional-lore.md) skill feat.
