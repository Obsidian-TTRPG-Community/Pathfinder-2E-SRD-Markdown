# Royalty
*Source: Advanced Player's Guide p. 51*  

You are a prominent member of a royal family. You have taken up the life of an adventurerâ€”perhaps you're a deposed queen hoping to regain her throne, a prince seeking a more exciting life, or a princess on a secret mission.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You are trained in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society). You gain the [Courtly Graces](compendium/feats/courtly-graces.md) skill feat and can influence commoners in your family's territory, as well as nobility anywhere. If you later gain the [Connections](compendium/feats/connections.md) skill feat, you automatically have common and noble connections within any community in your royal family's territory and have noble connections in large communities outside your territory.
