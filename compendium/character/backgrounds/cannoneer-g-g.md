# Cannoneer
*Source: Guns & Gears p. 122*  

You served as a crewmate aboard a military vessel or pirate ship and were responsible for the use and maintenance of the ship's cannons. A strong back and quick reflexes were equally important to you in your duties, and you know your way around explosives and the dangers that lie therein. These skills serve you well in your new life as an adventurer, as compared to the weight of a cannon, a gear load that makes your allies blanche just makes you laugh instead.

Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to Dexterity or Strength, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill and the [Warfare Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Hefty Hauler](compendium/feats/hefty-hauler.md) skill feat.
