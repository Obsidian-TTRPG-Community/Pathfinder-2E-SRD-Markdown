# Razmiran Faithful
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 34*  

You serve a living god who rules upon the face of Golarion, and this gives your actions a divine mandate not to be trifled with.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) skill and the [Razmir Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Group Coercion](compendium/feats/group-coercion.md) skill feat.
