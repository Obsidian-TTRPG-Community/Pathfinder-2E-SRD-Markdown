# Pilgrim
*Source: Advanced Player's Guide p. 49*  

In your youth, you made several pilgrimages to important shrines and holy sites. You might have been a mendicant friar, a seller of holy relics (real or fraudulent), or just a simple farmer following the dictates of your faith. Whatever the aims of your wanderings now, your faith still protects you on the road.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) skill and the [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill for your patron deity. You gain the [Pilgrim's Token](compendium/feats/pilgrims-token-apg.md) skill feat.
