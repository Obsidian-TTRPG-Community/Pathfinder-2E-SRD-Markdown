# Student Of Magic
*Source: Secrets of Magic p. 29*  

You are currently enrolled at a school of magic, where you're learning the fundamentals of your magical tradition. Whether your adventuring occurs during breaks between semesters, as part of a work study program, or even within the halls of the academy itself, you'll have to learn to juggle your dual life.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in your choice of [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion), as well as [Academia Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore). You gain the [Recognize Spell](compendium/feats/recognize-spell.md) skill feat.
