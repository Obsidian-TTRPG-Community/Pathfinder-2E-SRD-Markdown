# Entertainer
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 61*  

Through an education in the arts or sheer dogged practice, you learned to entertain crowds. You might have been an actor, a dancer, a musician, a street magician, or any other sort of performer.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) skill and the [Theater Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Fascinating Performance](compendium/feats/fascinating-performance.md) skill feat.
