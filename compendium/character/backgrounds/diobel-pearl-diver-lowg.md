You spent a portion of your youth diving and gathering precious pearls under the attentive eyes of Kortos Consortium merchants.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill and the [Ocean Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Underwater Marauder](compendium/feats/underwater-marauder.md) skill feat.
