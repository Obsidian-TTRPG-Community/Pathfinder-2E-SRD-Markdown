# Local Scion
*Source: Age of Ashes Player's Guide p. 5*  

You're from Breachill and have lived there most, if not all, of your life. You might be the son or daughter of a well-known local adventuring family, or a family with a storied tradition of military or other martial service. You likely also have some sort of skill with your hands, as the people of Breachill are very self-sufficient.

The Call for Heroes is one of your hometown's most iconic traditions, and you want to attend so you can prove your own merits to the councilâ€”beyond simply those of your family's name.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be Constitution or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) skill and the [Breachill Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Specialty Crafting](compendium/feats/specialty-crafting.md) skill feat.
