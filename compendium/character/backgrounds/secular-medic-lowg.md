# Secular Medic
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 58*  

You're from Rahadoum, where the Laws of Mortality taught you to reject the gods, yet you've seen firsthand how dangerous it can be to go without healing magic. As a result, you've thrown yourself into the study of medicine, so you can save lives without saving souls.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) skill and the [Anatomy Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Battle Medicine](compendium/feats/battle-medicine.md) skill feat.
