# Bounty Hunter
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 61*  

Bringing in lawbreakers lined your pockets. Maybe you had an altruistic motive and sought to bring in criminals to make the streets safer, or maybe the coin was motivation enough. Your techniques for hunting down criminals transfer easily to the life of an adventurer.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) skill and the [Legal Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Experienced Tracker](compendium/feats/experienced-tracker.md) skill feat.
