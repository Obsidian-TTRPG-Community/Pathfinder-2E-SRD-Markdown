# Hunter
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 62*  

You stalked and took down animals and other creatures of the wild. Skinning animals, harvesting their flesh, and cooking them were also part of your training, all of which can give you useful resources while you adventure.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) skill and the [Tanning Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Survey Wildlife](compendium/feats/survey-wildlife.md) skill feat.
