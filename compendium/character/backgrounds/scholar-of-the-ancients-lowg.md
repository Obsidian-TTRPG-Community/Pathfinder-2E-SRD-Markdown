# Scholar Of The Ancients
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 70*  

You're fascinated by the lost Azlanti Empire and have dedicated yourself to seeking out and studying every broken artifact or scrap of knowledge that remains, whether as an academic pursuit or simply for the joy of treasure hunting.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) skill and the [Azlant Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skills. You gain the [Quick Identification](compendium/feats/quick-identification.md) skill feat.
