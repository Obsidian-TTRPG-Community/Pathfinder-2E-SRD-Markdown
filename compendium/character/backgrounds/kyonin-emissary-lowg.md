You were trained to be an ambassador of the elven land of Kyonin, and you have now been sent out into the wider world to build alliances between Kyonin and the neighboring kingdoms.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) skill and the [Politics Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Multilingual](compendium/feats/multilingual.md) skill feat.
