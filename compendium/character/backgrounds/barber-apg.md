# Barber
*Source: Advanced Player's Guide p. 48*  

Haircuts, dentistry, bloodletting, and surgeryâ€”if it takes a steady hand and a razor, you do it. You may have taken to the road to expand your skills, or to test yourself against a world that leaves your patients so battered and bruised.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) skill and the [Surgery Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Risky Surgery](compendium/feats/risky-surgery-apg.md) skill feat.
