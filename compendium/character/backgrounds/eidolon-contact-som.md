# Eidolon Contact
*Source: Secrets of Magic p. 28*  

You've come into contact with a disembodied being of magical essence known as an eidolon.

You might have forged a powerful conduit with that eidolon, allowing you to manifest it as a summoner, but it's much more likely that you lost contact over time, though not before learning a few half-remembered secrets. If you lost contact, you might have become an adventurer to try to reach the eidolon again, or to be sure that you're rid of it forever.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in your choice of [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion), and a [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill for the creature associated with your contacted eidolon (such as [Angel Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) or [Dragon Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore)). You gain the [Dubious Knowledge](compendium/feats/dubious-knowledge.md) skill feat.
