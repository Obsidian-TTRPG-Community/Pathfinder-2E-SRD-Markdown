# Artist
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 60*  

Your art is your greatest passion, whatever form it takes.

Adventuring might help you find inspiration, or simply be a way to survive until you become a world-famous artist.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) skill and the [Art Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Specialty Crafting](compendium/feats/specialty-crafting.md) skill feat.
