*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 34*  

Whether you trace your heritage to lost Sarkoris or are a crusader trying to atone for past fanatics' wrongs, you seek to liberate the Sarkorian homeland from the demons who have defiled it.

You're trained in the [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) skill and the [Abyssal Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Battle Medicine](compendium/feats/battle-medicine.md) skill feat.
