# Issian Partisan
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 34*  

You grew up among the northern houses of Brevoy in old Issia.

Steeped in the cultural legacy of pirates and smugglers, you rely on your cleverness and charm as you make your way throughout the world.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) skill and the [Underworld Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Charming Liar](compendium/feats/charming-liar.md) skill feat.
