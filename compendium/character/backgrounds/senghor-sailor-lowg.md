# Senghor Sailor
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 94*  

As an experienced sailor from Senghor, you know that the only thing saving you from disaster on the high seas is a properly maintained ship. You know boat-building inside and out and you can quickly cobble together a solution in the event that something breaks.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) skill and the [Sailing Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Quick Repair](compendium/feats/quick-repair.md) skill feat.
