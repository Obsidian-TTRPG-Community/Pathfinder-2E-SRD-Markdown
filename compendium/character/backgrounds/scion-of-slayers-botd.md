# Scion of Slayers
*Source: Book of the Dead p. 16*  

You were born into a lineage of undead slayers. No mere occupation, in your family slaying is a mantle of almost mystic responsibility passed from parent to child. Over the generations, this single-minded focus has begun to manifest in uncanny ways during combat.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill and the [Undead Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You can cast [disrupt undead](compendium/spells/disrupt-undead.md) as an innate divine cantrip.

You can use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for this innate spell.
