# Emissary
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 61*  

As a diplomat or messenger, you traveled to lands far and wide. Communicating with new people and forming alliances were your stock and trade.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) skill and a [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill related to one city you've visited often. You gain the [Multilingual](compendium/feats/multilingual.md) skill feat.
