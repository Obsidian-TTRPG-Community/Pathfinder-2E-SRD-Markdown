# Pyre Tender
*Source: Book of the Dead p. 16*  

You're experienced at building funeral pyres. You might have lit flaming biers in the Land of the Linnorm Kings, tended the cremation pits of Cheliax or Vudra, or been a backwoods charcoal burner, using the right mixture of alchemy to act as an accelerant. However you worship, you know nothing sends off the departed like flame.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) skill and the [Funeral Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Alchemical Crafting](compendium/feats/alchemical-crafting.md) skill feat.
