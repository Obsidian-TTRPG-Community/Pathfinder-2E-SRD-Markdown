# Elementally Infused
*Source: Rage of Elements p. 44*  

You were exposed to a strong burst of elemental essence originating directly from an elemental plane, most likely caused by a planar breach. Your body absorbed the elemental essence with no ill effects, and now it coalesces within you. With time, you've learned to project elemental power in a manner safe to you but still deadly to others.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Constitution or Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.

Choose one elemental plane: Air, Earth, Fire, Metal, Water, or Wood. You are trained in the corresponding [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill: Plane of [Air Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), Plane of [Earth Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), Plane of [Fire Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), Plane of [Metal Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), Plane of [Water Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), or Plane of [Wood Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore). You also gain a cantrip according to your chosen plane: air gale blast SoM; Earth: scatter scree SoM; Fire: ignition; Metal: needle darts (page 144); Water spout SoM, or wood root reading (page 197). You can cast this spell as a primal innate spell at will.
