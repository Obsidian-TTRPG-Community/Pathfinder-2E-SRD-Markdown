# Chelish Rebel
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 106*  

You joined the fight against House Thrune. You may have helped liberate the nation of Ravounel, or you might be involved in another rebellion, such as Pezzack's, that studied Ravounel's successes.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) skill and the [Kintargo Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Streetwise](compendium/feats/streetwise.md) skill feat.
