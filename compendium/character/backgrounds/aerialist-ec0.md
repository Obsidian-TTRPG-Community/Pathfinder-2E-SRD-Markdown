# Aerialist
*Source: Extinction Curse Player's Guide p. 4*  

Experienced with trapezes, aerial silks, and hoops, your skill is in performing death-defying stunts high above the ground. The Celestial Menagerie skimped on safety devices such as nets and quality ropes, so you also learned to take a fall better than most. After a harrowing near-death experience involving a cracked trapeze bar, you decided to take your expertise elsewhere.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) skill and the [Rope Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Cat Fall](compendium/feats/cat-fall.md) skill feat.
