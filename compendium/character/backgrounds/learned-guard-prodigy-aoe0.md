# Learned Guard Prodigy
*Source: Agents of Edgewatch Player's Guide p. 7*  

For some, the nuts and bolts of keeping the peace are practically second nature. Such is the case for you, a member of the Learned Guard with an incredible mind for investigation as well as a gift for understanding magic. You probably aren't a hit with your peers, who find your intellect and natural gift of deduction perhaps a bit off-putting, but when left to your own devices you excel, and you get along well with professors and mages such as those who work in Forae Logos or the [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana)mirium.

After no shortage of debating the pros and cons, you decided to transfer to the Edgewatch precinct. Sure, you have a keen understanding of the theories and principles behind law enforcement, but you've reasoned that in order to be a truly effective guard you'll need some first-hand experience in a high-risk area nabbing suspects and protecting innocentsâ€”all the while taking fastidious notes and writing your grand thesis on the merits and shortcomings of Absalom's laws.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in your choice of the [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) or [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) skill, as well as [Legal Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore). You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), and [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks to interact with Learned Guards and with academics such as librarians and scholars. You gain the [Recognize Spell](compendium/feats/recognize-spell.md) skill feat.
