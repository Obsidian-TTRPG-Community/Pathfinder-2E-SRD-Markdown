# Rigger
*Source: Extinction Curse Player's Guide p. 6*  

You've worked as a roustabout to erect tents and set up rigging for acrobatic performances; you've sometimes even aided aerialists and acrobats in their death-defying training.

Even though your work is often done before the crowds arrive, you know your skills contribute to the success and safety of the circus. Mistress Dusklight treats her roustabouts as little more than slaves, and you've resolved to join a company where your expertise is appreciated.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill and the [Circus Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Combat Climber](compendium/feats/combat-climber.md) skill feat.
