# Desert Tracker
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 58*  

You're at home blazing trails in the burning sands, and you made a living guiding or following creatures in the desert. You might be a native nomad, an experienced desert guide, a naturalist, a bandit driven into the dunes by the lawâ€”or all of the above.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) skill and the [Desert Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Experienced Tracker](compendium/feats/experienced-tracker.md) skill feat.
