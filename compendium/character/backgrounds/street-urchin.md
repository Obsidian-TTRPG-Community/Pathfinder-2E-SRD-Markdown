# Street Urchin
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 64*  

You eked out a living by picking pockets on the streets of a major city, never knowing where you'd find your next meal. While some folk adventure for the glory, you do so to survive.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) and a [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill for the city you lived in as a street urchin (such as [Absalom Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) or [Magnimar Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore)). You gain the [Pickpocket](compendium/feats/pickpocket.md) skill feat.
