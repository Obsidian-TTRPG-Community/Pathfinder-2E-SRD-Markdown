# Pathfinder Recruiter
*Source: Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide p. 8*  

The Pathfinder Society's always on the lookout for talent, but that talent rarely just stumbles into the Grand Lodge. Whether you're professionally trained to encourage new recruits or the [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society)'s own scouts identified your potential and raised you from childhood, you're committed to expanding the [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society)'s roster.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) skill and a [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill related to one city you've visited often. You gain the [Group Impression](compendium/feats/group-impression.md) skill feat.
