# Street Preacher
*Source: Secrets of Magic p. 29*  

Forget the church orthodoxy and the stuffy cloistersâ€”spreading the word of your god to the people is your calling. You've preached on the street corners and in public houses, to wanderers on the road and to captives in the stocks. Adventuring can take you across the world. What vocation could better serve to take your holy words to fresh ears?

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) skill and the [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill for your patron deity. You gain the [Dubious Knowledge](compendium/feats/dubious-knowledge.md) skill feat.
