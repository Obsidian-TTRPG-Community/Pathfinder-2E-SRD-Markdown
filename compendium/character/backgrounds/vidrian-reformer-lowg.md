# Vidrian Reformer
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 94*  

You know that the only way your homeland of Vidrian can remain free from outside conquerors is by forging a strong and unified government. As such, you seek to bind your fellow citizens together through careful diplomacy and force of personalityâ€”or, if necessary, subterfuge and intrigue.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) skill and the [Politics Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Hobnobber](compendium/feats/hobnobber.md) skill feat.
