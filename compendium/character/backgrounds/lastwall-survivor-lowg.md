# Lastwall Survivor
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 46*  

You managed to escape the devastation that the Whispering Tyrant brought to your nation, but you lost everything to the lich-king's minions, including your home and many friends and family.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) skill and the [Undead Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Battle Medicine](compendium/feats/battle-medicine.md) skill feat.
