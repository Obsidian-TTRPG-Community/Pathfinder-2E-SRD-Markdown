# Tax Collector
*Source: Advanced Player's Guide p. 49*  

Reviled but required, you were sent when taxes were due. Performing your job might have required travel and persuasion, or perhaps you were responsible for collecting taxes on trade. Either way, it sometimes meant dirty hands, and adventuring seemed the next logical step to you.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) skill and the [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill for the settlement that employed you. You gain the [Quick Coercion](compendium/feats/quick-coercion.md) skill feat.
