# Detective
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 61*  

You solved crimes as a police inspector or took jobs for wealthy clients as a private investigator. You might have become an adventurer as part of your next big mystery, but likely it was due to the consequences or aftermath of a prior case.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) skill and the [Underworld Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Streetwise](compendium/feats/streetwise.md) skill feat.
