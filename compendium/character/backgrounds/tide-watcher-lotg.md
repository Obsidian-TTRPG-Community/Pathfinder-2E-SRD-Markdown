# Tide Watcher
*Source: Lost Omens: Travel Guide p. 123*  

Where you hail from, the ocean is the lifeblood of your community; knowing how it changes according to the moon was integral to everyday life. You've studied the moon's phases to predict the rise and fall of the ocean waters. Eventually, you gained a supernatural ability to foretell to some degree of accuracy the coming of more severe changes, such as tidal waves or encroaching storms. At times, it fell on you to warn settlements of such oncoming natural disasters.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature) and [Ocean Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore). During the night when you can see the moon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) checks to discern weather patterns and predict upcoming weather conditionsâ€”this bonus increases to +2 if you're in the vicinity of the ocean.
