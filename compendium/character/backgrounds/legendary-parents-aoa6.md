# Legendary Parents
*Source: Age of Ashes #6: Broken Promises p. 73*  

One or more of your parents (either biological or adoptive) were heroes of the Age of Ashes Adventure Path. Others tend to treat you with a bit more respect, or perhaps fear your connections to people of great power.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be in Dexterity or Charisma, and the other is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) skill and the [Genealogy Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Group Coercion](compendium/feats/group-coercion.md) skill feat.
