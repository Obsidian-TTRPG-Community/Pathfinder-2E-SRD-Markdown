# Guard
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 62*  

You served in the guard, out of either patriotism or the need for coin. Either way, you know how to get a difficult suspect to talk.

However you left the guard, you might think of adventuring as a way to use your skills on a wider stage.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) skill and the [Legal Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) or [Warfare Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Quick Coercion](compendium/feats/quick-coercion.md) skill feat.
