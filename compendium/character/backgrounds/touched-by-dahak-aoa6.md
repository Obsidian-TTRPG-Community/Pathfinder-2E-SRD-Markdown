# Touched By Dahak
*Source: Age of Ashes #6: Broken Promises p. 73*  

As the manifestation of [Dahak](compendium/setting/deities/dahak-logm.md) was destroyed, a shard of the dragon god's wrathful nature infused you, resulting in a violent temper, strange apocalyptic dreams, an obsession with dragon hunting, or some other touch of his influence.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be in Strength or Charisma, and the other is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill and the [Dragon Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Titan Wrestler](compendium/feats/titan-wrestler.md) skill feat.
