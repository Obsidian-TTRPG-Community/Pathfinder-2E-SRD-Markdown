# Quick
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 82*  

Staying alive among the scheming, ravenous undead of Geb required a deep knowledge of their motivations, capabilities, and weaknesses. More often than not, it also required the ability to weave alibis and life-preserving half-truths capable of swaying a stilled heart.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) skill and the [Undead Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Charming Liar](compendium/feats/charming-liar.md) skill feat.
