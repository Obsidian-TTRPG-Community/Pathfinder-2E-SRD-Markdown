# Mantis Scion
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 70*  

At least one of your parents is a member of the notorious Red Mantis assassins, merciless killers for hire who rarely fail to claim their marks. Whether on purpose or by simple exposure, you were trained from a young age in the art of stalking and killing people.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) skill and the [Assassin Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Assurance](compendium/feats/assurance.md) skill feat with [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth).
