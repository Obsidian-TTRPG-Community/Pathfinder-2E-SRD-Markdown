# Taldan Schemer
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 130*  

Whether willing or unwilling, you have been involved in the many cutthroat political intrigues within Taldor. You might have been born into it as a member of the aristocracy, or you might have taken an active role in the recent events of the War for the Crown.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) skill and the [Politics Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Hobnobber](compendium/feats/hobnobber.md) skill feat.
