# Sailor
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 63*  

You heard the call of the sea from a young age. Perhaps you signed onto a merchant's vessel, joined the navy, or even fell in with a crew of pirates and scalawags.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill and the [Sailing Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Underwater Marauder](compendium/feats/underwater-marauder.md) skill feat.
