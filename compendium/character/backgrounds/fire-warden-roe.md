# Fire Warden
*Source: Rage of Elements p. 44*  

Whether you fought against fires in the wilderness or in crowded city streets, you've had your fair share of dealing with uncontrolled flames. Battling thick smoke and toxic fumes, you've [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) down obstacles to save trapped people from a fiery grave, and you've studied the nature and source of fire itself to try and better learn how to fight it. Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Strength or Constitution, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill and the Plane of [Fire Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the Breath Control feat.
