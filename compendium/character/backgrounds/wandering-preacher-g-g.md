# Wandering Preacher
*Source: Guns & Gears p. 123*  

While you once spoke to a small congregation in a ramshackle church, those days are behind you now. Your church was destroyed, your congregants scattered, and now you meander the lands holding a worn copy of your religious text in one hand, and a fiery conviction in the other.

Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) skill and a [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill associated with the deity you preach for (such as [Pharasmin Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore)). You gain the [Pilgrim's Token](compendium/feats/pilgrims-token-apg.md) skill feat.
