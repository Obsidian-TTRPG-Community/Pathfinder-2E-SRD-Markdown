# Barkeep
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 60*  

You have five specialties: hefting barrels, drinking, polishing steins, drinking, and drinking. You worked in a bar, where you learned how to hold your liquor and rowdily socialize.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) skill and the [Alcohol Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Hobnobber](compendium/feats/hobnobber.md) skill feat.
