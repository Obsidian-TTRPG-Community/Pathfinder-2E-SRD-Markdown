Your good work and big personality have made a big enough splash that word has gotten out about your status as a rising star among the watchdogs of Absalom. Your popularity has also earned you the trust of many citizens of the Foreign Quarter.

Your laudable performance has earned you a transfer to the newly formed Edgewatch in the Precipice Quarter, where you'll put your formidable reputation to good use by patrolling the Radiant Festival and ensuring the safety of Absalom's most vulnerable visitors.
