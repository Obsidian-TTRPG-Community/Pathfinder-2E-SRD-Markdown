# Legacy of the Hammer
*Source: Dark Archive p. 135*  

Your introduction to the criminal life was spurred forward by a seemingly innocuous hammer that provided you with all kinds of innovative criminal ideas. It has since left your possession, but every now and then you hear a faint whisper urging you toward crime.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) skill and [Engineering Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore). You gain the [Concealing Legerdemain](compendium/feats/concealing-legerdemain-apg.md) skill feat.
