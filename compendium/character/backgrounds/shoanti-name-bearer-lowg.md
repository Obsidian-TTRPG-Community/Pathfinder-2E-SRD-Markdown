# Shoanti Name-bearer
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 118*  

You are a member of a Shoanti quah and have gone through its coming of age ceremony, gaining the traditional tattoo of your quah and earning your adult name.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill and the [Quah Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Combat Climber](compendium/feats/combat-climber.md) skill feat.
