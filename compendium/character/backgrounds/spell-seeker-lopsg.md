# Spell Seeker
*Source: Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide p. 8*  

Conventional magic can only hold your attention for so long.

Instead, you've devoted yourself to understanding truly esoteric spells, which invariably draws you to explore the world and all its eldritch traditions.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in either the [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) skill or Occult skill, as well as the [Library Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Recognize Spell](compendium/feats/recognize-spell.md) skill feat.
