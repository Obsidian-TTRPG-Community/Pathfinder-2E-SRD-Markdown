# Reborn Soul
*Source: Dark Archive p. 176*  

You were given a second opportunity at life by mysterious forces in the Lands of Second Souls. You remember your life before your death and now live with an extra lifetime of knowledge.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You become trained in two [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skills, which you and your GM choose from [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skills associated with your past life. At 3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you receive skill increases, which you can apply only to these [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skills. In certain situations analogous to your past life, fragments of memories resurface, potentially helping or distracting you. The GM can offer you a +1 circumstance bonus on skill checks with either of these [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skills or on other skill checks that echo your past life. If you accept but fail the check, you're [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 minute by the mental distraction of your past-life memories, or [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 minute on a critical failure.
