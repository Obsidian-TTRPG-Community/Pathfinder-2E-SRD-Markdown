# Child Of Westcrown
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 106*  

Whether you come from Westcrown or elsewhere, you hold the values of pre-Thrune Cheliax dear. You disdain the infernal government, but you are proud of your country and do not consider yourself a rebel.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) skill and the [Westcrown Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Group Impression](compendium/feats/group-impression.md) skill feat.
