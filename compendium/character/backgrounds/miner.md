# Miner
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 63*  

You earned a living wrenching precious minerals from the lightless depths of the earth. Adventuring might have seemed lucrative or glamorous compared to this backbreaking laborâ€” and if you have to head back underground, this time you plan to do so armed with a real weapon instead of a miner's pick.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) skill and the [Mining Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Terrain Expertise](compendium/feats/terrain-expertise.md) skill feat with underground terrain.
