# Blow-in
*Source: Extinction Curse Player's Guide p. 5*  

You never expected to join a circus, but you were looking for a good place to lie low for reasons of your own. The Circus of Wayward Wonders came together with several different workers and performers a few months ago. Many came from a circus in Escadar called the Celestial Menagerie, but not all of them. It was easy to slip in among the roustabouts.

Although you'd planned to move on quickly, the circus folk have adopted you as one of their own, and they don't ask questions about your past.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in your choice of the [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) skills. You gain a skill feat: [Lengthy Diversion](compendium/feats/lengthy-diversion.md) if you chose [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), or [Subtle Theft](compendium/feats/subtle-theft.md) if you chose [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery). You are also trained in the [Underworld Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill.
