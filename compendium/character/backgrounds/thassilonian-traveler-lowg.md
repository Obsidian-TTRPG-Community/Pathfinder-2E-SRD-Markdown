# Thassilonian Traveler
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 118*  

You come from ancient Thassilon, one of the citizens that appeared out of time alongside the city of Xin-Edasseril. You know many things that have been long forgotten... along with many things that are no longer correct.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) skill and the [Thassilon Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Dubious Knowledge](compendium/feats/dubious-knowledge.md) skill feat.
