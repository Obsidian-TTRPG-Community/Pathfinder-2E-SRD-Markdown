# Seer Of The Dead
*Source: Secrets of Magic p. 31*  

You have long been gifted with the ability to see and speak with the departed. This could have manifested at your birth or when a chance encounter linked you inextricably to the spirits of the dead. Their constant presence might feel like a curse, or it might provide you with welcome companionship.

You gain one ability boost. It must be to Constitution or Wisdom.

You're trained in [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) and [Undead Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore). You gain the effects of the [spirit sense](compendium/spells/spirit-sense-apg.md) spell at all times.
