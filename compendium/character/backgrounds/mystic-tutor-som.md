# Mystic Tutor
*Source: Secrets of Magic p. 219*  

You spent years predicting, identifying, and harnessing the innate magical talents of those around you. A magic-rich world has taught you that you can never have too much training when everyone around you is capable of magic.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be Intelligence or Wisdom and one is a free ability boost.

Your innate [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) trait is [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md) or [occult](rules/traits/occult.md). You're trained in either [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) or [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), depending on your innate [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) trait, and the [Academia Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Recognize Spell](compendium/feats/recognize-spell.md) skill feat.
