# Undersea Enthusiast
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 70*  

You love diving and exploring the world beneath the waves, and long periods of swimming have trained you to move easily through the water. You're also fascinated by undersea creatures and culturesâ€”and may even have a trace of one of them in your own lineage.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill and the [Ocean Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Underwater Marauder](compendium/feats/underwater-marauder.md) skill feat.
