# Field Medic
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 62*  

In the chaotic rush of battle, you learned to adapt to rapidly changing conditions as you administered to battle casualties.

You patched up soldiers, guards, or other combatants, and learned a fair amount about the logistics of war.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) skill and the [Warfare Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Battle Medicine](compendium/feats/battle-medicine.md) skill feat.
