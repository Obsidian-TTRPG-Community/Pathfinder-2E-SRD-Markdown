# Bastion *Dedication Level 2*  

Some say that a good offense is the best defense, but you find such boasting smacks of overconfidence. In your experience, the best defense is a good, solid shield between you and your enemies. You've focused your training on how best to use a shield to protect yourself and those around you.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md)

You are particularly skilled at using a shield in combat. You gain the [Reactive Shield](compendium/feats/reactive-shield.md) fighter feat.

This fulfills any prerequisites requiring [Reactive Shield](compendium/feats/reactive-shield.md) as normal.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the bastion archetype.

- **Trigger** You [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) made with a held weapon.
- **Activity** Free Action

You attempt to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) the creature whose attack you blocked of the weapon they attacked you with. You can do so even if you don't have a hand free.

collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bastion Dedication](compendium/feats/bastion-dedication-apg.md)

You are so used to wielding a shield that you can do so even while using the hand that's holding it for other purposes. The hand you use to wield a shield counts as a free hand for the purposes of the [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action. You can also hold another object in this hand (but you still can't use it to wield a weapon). This benefit doesn't apply to tower shields, which are still too cumbersome.

When your shield is up, your enemies' blows can't touch you. When you have your [shield raised](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md), you can [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) to move half your Speed without triggering reactions that are triggered by your movement (such as [Attacks of Opportunity](rules/abilities/attack-of-opportunity.md)). You can use Shielded Stride while Flying or Swimming instead of [Striding](rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.

You can use your shield to fend off the worst of area effects and other damage. When you [Raise your Shield](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md), you gain your shield's circumstance bonus to Reflex saves. If you have the [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) reaction, damage you take as a result of a Reflex save can trigger that reaction, even if the damage isn't physical damage.

- **Prerequisites**: [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md)

You use your shield to protect your allies. When you have a [shield raised](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md), you can use your [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) reaction when an attack is made against an ally adjacent to you. If you do, the shield prevents that ally from taking damage instead of preventing you from taking damage, following the normal rules for [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md).

collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bastion Dedication](compendium/feats/bastion-dedication-apg.md)

You can protect yourself more effectively, at the expense of your shield. When you [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md), you can reduce the damage to yourself by double the shield's Hardness, but if you do, the shield takes double the normal amount of damage it would have taken (before applying its Hardness). You can't use Destructive Block if your shield can't be [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) or destroyed, such as if you're using an [indestructible shield](compendium/equipment/items/indestructible-shield.md).

- **Prerequisites**: [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md)

You can bring your shield into place with hardly a thought. At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction that you can use only to [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md).

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Mirror Shield](compendium/feats/mirror-shield.md) is intended for use with the Bastion Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Trigger** An opponent casting a spell that targets you critically fails a spell attack roll against your AC.
- **Requirements**: You have a [shield raised](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

You reflect the spell back against the triggering opponent. Make a ranged attack against the triggering creature using your highest proficiency with a ranged weapon. If you can cast spells, you can make a spell attack roll instead. If you succeed, your opponent takes the effects of a successful spell attack roll for their own spell (or the effects of a critical success if your attack roll was a critical success).

- **Prerequisites**: [Bastion Dedication](compendium/feats/bastion-dedication-apg.md)

You can save your shield from total destruction, even after a devastating attack. If a shield would be destroyed due to damage taken during your [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md), the shield remains intact at 1 Hit Point instead. Its construction is weakened until you take the time to repair it, preventing you from using Shield Salvation to save the same shield until your next preparations.
