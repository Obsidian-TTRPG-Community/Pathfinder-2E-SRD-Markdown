[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: You must befriend at least one Turpin Rowe logger.
- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival)

Your logging training has made you intimately familiar with all aspects of forestry, and you have trained extensively to reach around trees and utilize their bulk to your advantage. You become trained in [Milling Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) and [Forest Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), or an expert if you were already trained. You can always [Take Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md) when you are within forest terrain to gain cover, even if you're not next to an obstacle you can [Take Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md) behind. In addition, any enemy who gains standard cover from a tree gains only lesser cover against your attacks (or only standard cover, if the enemy otherwise gains greater cover).

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Turpin Rowe lumberjack archetype.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Turpin Rowe Lumberjack Dedication](compendium/feats/turpin-rowe-lumberjack-dedication-ec3.md)

When you are climbing a wooden surface and have a hatchet or battle axe in each hand, you have a climb Speed equal to half your normal Speed. You must still have both legs available to climb and can't use either of the axes in combat while climbing. This feat can also be used to climb a surface of ice if you have a light pick in each hand.

- **Prerequisites**: [Turpin Rowe Lumberjack Dedication](compendium/feats/turpin-rowe-lumberjack-dedication-ec3.md)

- **Activity** Single Action

You shuffle your feet to dislodge the surface beneath you or otherwise cause your opponent to become unsteady.

Attempt an [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check against the adjacent creature's Reflex saving throw DC. On a success, the creature falls. On a critical failure, you fall.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Turpin Rowe Lumberjack Dedication](compendium/feats/turpin-rowe-lumberjack-dedication-ec3.md)

You have mastered the weight and balance of a variety of axes and can lob them with ease. Any one-handed axe weapon you wield has the [thrown](rules/traits/thrown.md "Thrown Weapon Trait") trait with a range of 10 feet. For axes that already have the [thrown](rules/traits/thrown.md "Thrown Weapon Trait") trait, the range increases by 10 feet. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with a thrown axe weapon, you apply the axe's critical specialization effect.

Once you have penetrated a foe's defenses, you can home in on the same spot to exploit your opponent's wound and deal some serious damage. The second time you hit and deal damage with a melee axe [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) to the same opponent or object during your turn, you ignore half of the opponent's or object's Hardness, if any. If you hit and deal damage with a melee axe [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) to the same opponent or object a third or fourth time during your turn, you ignore all of its Hardness, if any.
