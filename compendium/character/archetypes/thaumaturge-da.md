# Thaumaturge *Dedication Level 2*  

Scraps of knowledge have taught you how to exploit the vulnerabilities of creatures and the powers of mystical objects.

## Multiclass Thaumaturge Characters
<sup>DA p. 49</sup>

Thaumaturge suits characters who want to glean strange knowledge. It's especially useful for those who tend to fight with one-handed weapons, like swashbucklers or rogues, since they have their other hand free for an implement.

- **Prerequisites**: Charisma 14

You've uncovered basic thaumaturgy. You become trained in thaumaturge class DC. Choose an first implement and esoterica|thaumaturge|DA|1||implement; you can use it to Glimpse Vulnerability, but don't gain its benefits. You also gain a few esoterica, allowing you to use [esoterica](rules/traits/esoterica-da.md "Esoterica Action & Ability Trait") actions. You become trained in your choice of [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion); if you were already trained in these, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the Glimpse Vulnerability action.

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Requirements**: You are holding your implement

**Effect** You glimpse a hidden vulnerability and then strengthen it to aid you. Select a creature you can see. Until you Glimpse Vulnerability again, that target gains weakness 2 against your unarmed and weapon [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md).
