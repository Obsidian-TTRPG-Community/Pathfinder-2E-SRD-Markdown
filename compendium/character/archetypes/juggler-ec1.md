You become trained in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance); if you were already trained in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the Juggle skill feat (page 76), even if you don't meet its prerequisites.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained one other feat from the juggler archetype.

- **Trigger** An item falls within your reach or an attacker fails an attack roll to hit you or a creature within your reach with a thrown weapon.
- **Requirements**: The item or thrown weapon is of a Bulk you can Juggle.
- **Activity** Reaction

You grab the triggering item. If you are Juggling, you can immediately add the item to the objects you're Juggling as a free action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") and [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") traits.

collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance), [Juggler Dedication](compendium/feats/juggler-dedication-ec1.md)
- **Requirements**: You are Juggling a thrown weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

You make a thrown ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the required weapon, using the weapon's normal range increment. This attack doesn't trigger reactions, and if the target has never seen you use this feat before, the target is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against this attack.

collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Opportune Throw](compendium/feats/opportune-throw-ec1.md) is intended for use with the Juggler Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance), [Juggler Dedication](compendium/feats/juggler-dedication-ec1.md)
- **Trigger** A creature within 10 feet of you uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.
- **Requirements**: You are Juggling a thrown weapon.
- **Activity** Reaction

You make a thrown ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the required weapon against the triggering creature. If you critically succeed and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action.

This [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) doesn't count against your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
