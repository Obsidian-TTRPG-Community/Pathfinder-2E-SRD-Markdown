# Swashbuckler *Dedication Level 2*  

You fight with flair and style, adding swashbuckling tricks to your combat repertoire.

## Multiclass Swashbuckler characters
<sup>APG p. 153</sup>

The swashbuckler archetype is a great fit for martial characters who want to be a bit flashier or for Charisma-based spellcasters who want to add a bit of dramatic flair to their routine. Multiclass swashbucklers work especially well for characters who already wanted to perform the actions associated with gaining panache, such as a monk or barbarian with the gymnast style or a braggart, battledancer, or wit-style bard.
