# Zombie *Dedication Level 2*  

You are a zombie, a rotting corpse animated by necromantic magic. Although most zombies are mindless brutes, you're a husk zombie, preserved through necromantic rites and alchemical reagents. The process worked especially well on you, and you retained your intelligence and identity to a far greater degree than other husk zombies.

It's not easy being a corpse. Your body continues to rot and putrefy, and the stench is ever present. Your old self keeps slipping away, more and more as the weeks pass by. Your reflexes have slowed, you're beginning to lose your sense of touch, and your emotions are dulling. As your body continues to decay, so too, does your mind. Your memory's not perfect, and although you haven't noticed any huge gaps or flaws yet, you have a feeling they're there somewhere.

Unlike your other senses, your hunger has intensified. You ceaselessly crave the raw flesh and brains of the living—the smarter the better—and satisfying this hunger is the only thing that makes you feel alive. When you eat, you're reinvigorated; feeling returns and the constant mental torpor you live under vanishes. You feel like yourself again... for a time.

One day you might be nothing more than a walking corpse, but for now, you retain your personality and your free will. Feeding your hunger might allow you to remain that way.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: You died and were animated as a husk zombie.

Despite your death and subsequent reanimation as a rotting corpse, you retain most of your mind and identity. Yet, it's always there: the hunger for the flesh and organs of the living. You gain the [undead](rules/traits/undead.md "Undead Creature Type Trait") and [zombie](rules/traits/zombie-b1.md "Zombie Creature Trait") traits, and the basic undead benefits (page 44). Unlike a typical zombie, you're not [mindless](rules/traits/mindless.md "Mindless Creature Trait"). Reduce all your Speeds by 5 feet. Your fist loses the [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait") trait.

Because of its progressing state of decay, your body requires continual maintenance to remain at its best. Each day after your rest period, your body is deteriorated due to natural decay. Additionally, some zombie abilities allow you to push for a greater effect in exchange for a chance of deteriorating your body.

While your body is deteriorated, you're [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed). You can spend 10 minutes checking and repairing your joints and other weak parts of your body to recover from deterioration. You can perform these repairs as part of your daily preparations. Because it's a natural result of your body's functions, you can't remove the [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) condition from deterioration through any other means.

You crave the flesh of the living. You gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals `1d8` piercing damage. Your jaws are in the brawling group and have the [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") trait. You can use your jaws [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) only against a creature that's [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by you.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the zombie archetype.

- **Prerequisites**: [Zombie Dedication](compendium/feats/zombie-dedication-botd.md)

You fight just as well on the ground as you do standing up. While you are [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone), you are always [Taking Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md) against ranged attacks, you ignore the status penalty on your attack rolls from being [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone), and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md). You can choose to move up to half your Speed when you [Crawl](rules/actions/crawl.md). You can instead move up to your full Speed when you [Crawl](rules/actions/crawl.md), but if you do, you must succeed at a DC 6 flat check or your body deteriorates.

As your body continues to rot and putrefy, your senses deaden and your undead powers grow. You gain the advanced undead benefits (page 44), as well as a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") and pain effects. While your body is deteriorated, your numbness amplifies in two ways: the circumstance bonus from this feat increases to +2, and if you roll a success on a saving throw against an [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") or pain effect, you get a critical success instead.

title: Out of Hand, Feat 8
collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Zombie Dedication](compendium/feats/zombie-dedication-botd.md)

Even when your limbs are severed, they remain a part of you. When an arm is severed from your body, it gains the [minion](rules/traits/minion.md "Minion Creature Trait") trait. While severed, your limb has the statistics of a familiar (Core Rulebook 217–218) without any familiar or master abilities, except its Speed is 5 feet, it can't move further than 100 feet from you, it can [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) with things, and it can still make any unarmed [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) it could have made while attached to you (usually a fist [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)). Any [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) it makes share your multiple attack penalty and use your attack bonus and damage. If your arm is reduced to 0 HP or is ever more than 100 feet from you, it becomes inert until reattached. The GM might allow you to detach other limbs that have unarmed attacks using the below action (for example, if you're a tiefling with [Form of the Fiend](compendium/feats/form-of-the-fiend-apg.md), giving you a tail unarmed attack). You gain the Lay Down Arms action.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Lay Down Arms** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")


You pull your arm off, harmlessly severing it from your body and dropping it in an adjacent square. You can also use this action to reattach your severed arm if it's adjacent to you; it immediately functions normally. If the detached limb was at 0 Hit Points, it takes 10 minutes to reattach it instead of a single action.
