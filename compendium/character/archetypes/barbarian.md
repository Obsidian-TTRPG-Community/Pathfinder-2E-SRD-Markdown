# Barbarian *Dedication Level 2*  

There's a rage deep inside you that sometimes breaks loose, granting you some of the might of a barbarian in addition to your other abilities.

## Multiclass Barbarian characters
<sup>CRB p. 221</sup>

The barbarian archetype is a great choice for characters that emphasize Strength and melee attacks more than usual for their class, as long as they can handle Rage's spellcasting restriction. It's especially good for characters looking to add more damage.

- **Prerequisites**: Strength 14, Constitution 14

You become trained in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics); if you were already trained in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You become trained in barbarian class DC.

You can use the [Rage](rules/actions/rage.md) action.

Choose an instinct|Barbarian||1 as you would if you were a barbarian. You have that instinct for all purposes and become bound by its anathema, but you don't gain any of the other abilities it grants.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the barbarian archetype.
