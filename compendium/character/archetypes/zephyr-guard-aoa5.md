- **Access**: You are from Katapesh.
- **Prerequisites**: member of the Zephyr Guard

As a Zephyr Guard, you're always vigilant against crime and threats to the city's safety. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks against attempts to [Palm an Object](rules/actions/palm-an-object.md), [Steal](rules/actions/steal.md), or [Conceal an Object](rules/actions/conceal-an-object.md) (including you're [Seeking](rules/actions/seek.md) [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) objects). You become trained in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) and [Katapesh Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Zephyr Guard archetype.

- **Prerequisites**: [Zephyr Guard Dedication](compendium/feats/zephyr-guard-dedication-aoa5.md), trained in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics)

When you succeed, but don't critically succeed, at a check to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) a creature, your circumstance bonus to further checks to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) that creature is +4 instead of +2. Other creatures gain only the normal bonus.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Zephyr Guard Dedication](compendium/feats/zephyr-guard-dedication-aoa5.md), expert in [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception)
- **Activity** Single Action

You have witnessed hundreds of fighting styles and quickly adapt to defend against complicated maneuvers. Choose a creature within 30 feet who you're aware of, and attempt a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check against that target's Will DC. If you succeed, you size up their fighting style, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saving throws against that creature's attacks (or a +2 circumstance bonus for a critical success). These benefits last until the end of your next turn.
