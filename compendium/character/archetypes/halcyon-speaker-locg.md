# Halcyon Speaker *Dedication Level 6*  

One of Old-Mage Jatembe's central lessons was that magic was magic, no matter what the source. Though the Magaambya seeks to hold true to Jatembe's teachings by aiming to understand magic of all kinds, the mages of the Magaambya have found the most success with magic rooted in the material world. Halcyon speakers are powerful conversants who epitomize the Magaambyan practice of blending arcane and primal magic, seeing both traditions as flowing from the same wellspring.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](compendium/feats/magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), member of the Magaambya of conversant rank

You devote much of your study to halcyon magic. You gain two common Halcyon cantrips and two common 1st-level halcyon spells (see Halcyon Spells on page 100). In addition to being able to cast your halcyon spells via your arcane or primal spell slots, you also gain a 1st-level halcyon spell slot. You can use your halcyon spell slots to spontaneously cast your halcyon spells.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the halcyon speaker archetype.

- **Prerequisites**: [Halcyon Speaker Dedication](compendium/feats/halcyon-speaker-dedication-locg.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from your spell slots, you gain a benefit. If the spell is arcane, you can attempt a skill check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) with a +1 status bonus to the check after casting the spell, or a +2 status bonus if the spell is 7th level or higher. If the spell is primal, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the spell's level for 1 round. If the spell is a halcyon spell, you gain both benefits.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Halcyon Speaker Dedication](compendium/feats/halcyon-speaker-dedication-locg.md)

You can cast [creation](compendium/spells/creation.md) as an innate spell at will, choosing whether it is arcane or primal each time. The created object lasts until you spend 1 hour not within its immediate vicinity or until it is destroyed. Such objects are called persistent creations. If you cast [creation](compendium/spells/creation.md) again, any persistent creation you previously created with the spell immediately disintegrates.

When you draw upon your spells' synergy, you create a physical manifestation of their magical resonance and invoke it to harm a foe. When you use Dualistic Synergy, choose a damage type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. In addition to Dualistic Synergy's normal effect, a foe within 30 feet of you takes an amount of damage of the chosen type equal to the spell's level. If the spell already deals damage of the chosen type, combine the damage before applying weaknesses and resistances.

This spell must be cast from one of your halcyon spell slots and be a spell that would normally take two actions to cast.
