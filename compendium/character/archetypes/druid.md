# Druid *Dedication Level 2*  

You have entered a druidic circle and learned a few of the order's secrets, granting you primal power.

## Multiclass Druid characters
<sup>CRB p. 225</sup>

The druid archetype can provide a bit of healing or elemental damage and can increase your utility in a natural environment with spells like [speak with animals](compendium/spells/speak-with-animals.md) and [meld into stone](compendium/spells/meld-into-stone.md).

- **Prerequisites**: Wisdom 14

You cast spells like a druid. You gain access to the [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) activity. You can prepare two common cantrips each day from the primal spell list in this book or any other cantrips you learn or discover. You're trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for primal spells. Your key spellcasting ability for druid archetype spells is Wisdom, and they are primal druid spells.

You learn the Druidic language.

Choose an order as you would if you were a druid. You become a member of that order and are bound by its anathema, allowing you to take the order's feats. You become trained in [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature) and your order's associated skill; for each of these skills in which you were already trained, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You don't gain any other abilities from your choice of order.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the druid archetype.
