# Acrobat *Dedication Level 2*  

You have trained your body to perform incredible, seemingly superhuman feats of grace. You move in ways that leave your opponents caught off guard and fumbling for a response, turning every fight into performance art.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics)

You become an expert in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics). At 7th level, you become a master in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics), and at 15th level, you become legendary in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics). Whenever you critically succeed at an [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Tumble Through](rules/actions/tumble-through.md) an enemy's space, you don't treat the enemy's space as difficult terrain.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the acrobat archetype.

# Contortionist  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Acrobat Dedication](compendium/feats/acrobat-dedication-apg.md)

You can squeeze out of tight situations surprisingly quickly, gaining an advantage against foes that try to pin you down.

You gain the [Quick Squeeze](compendium/feats/quick-squeeze.md) skill feat, and if you're a master in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics), you can [Squeeze](rules/actions/squeeze.md) at full Speed. Whenever you successfully [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) using [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics), the creature you [Escaped](rules/actions/escape.md) from is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the next attack you make against it before the end of your next turn.

# Dodge Away  [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Acrobat Dedication](compendium/feats/acrobat-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** You are the target of a melee attack.
- **Requirements**: You're aware of the attack and aren't [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed).
- **Activity** Reaction

You use your acrobatic prowess to evade an attack, using momentum to keep yourself moving, if you choose. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack.

If the attack misses you, you can [Step](rules/actions/step.md) after the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). If you're a master in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics), you can move 10 feet on this [Step](rules/actions/step.md) instead of 5 feet.

- **Prerequisites**: [Acrobat Dedication](compendium/feats/acrobat-dedication-apg.md), master in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics)

Mass and muscle are meaningless when you leap; only grace and balance matter. You can roll an [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check instead of an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check when making a [High Jump](rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](rules/actions/long-jump.md).

- **Prerequisites**: [Acrobat Dedication](compendium/feats/acrobat-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You are adjacent to an enemy.
- **Activity** Single Action

Attempt an [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check against the Reflex DC of an enemy adjacent to you.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You move through the enemy's space to an unoccupied space on the other side of the enemy from your starting position. This movement doesn't trigger reactions. You can't move farther than your Speed, and you must end your movement adjacent to the enemy whose space you moved through. After moving, you make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the enemy whose space you moved through, and the enemy is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against that [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
> - **Success** As critical success, but the enemy isn't [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
> - **Failure** You remain in your original space but can still [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
> - **Critical Failure** No effect.

- **Prerequisites**: [Acrobat Dedication](compendium/feats/acrobat-dedication-apg.md)

- **Requirements**: Your most recent action was to [Tumble Through](rules/actions/tumble-through.md) or Tumbling [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), and you successfully moved through an enemy's space.
- **Activity** Free Action

You use a burst of stamina to perform a breathtaking feat of [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) as you speed through a foe's space, leaving your foe lying flat on their back. You attempt to [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) the enemy whose space you moved through. You can use [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) instead of [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) for this check.
