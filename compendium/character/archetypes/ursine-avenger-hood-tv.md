# Ursine Avenger Hood *Dedication Level 2*  

Over many generations, the magic of the hood was proven true, and more than that, the magic continued to grow and evolve with ever-more-ursine attributes. As the belief and power of each new wearer soaked into the hood, the artifact's potential has continued to grow. Now, those who bond with the generational artifact will discover that the _Ursine Avenger Hood_ continues to grow in power alongside them.

- **Activity** Single Action

You draw the Ursine Avenger Hood over your head and its fur over your arms, assuming an ursine form that has traits of your original form as well as that of a bear. In your ursine form, you gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals `1d8` piercing damage and a claws unarmed attack that deals `1d6` slashing damage and has the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait") trait. Both unarmed attacks are in the brawling group. You lose the ability to speak complex sentences while transformed and can only communicate through grunts and gestures; this prevents you from using effects that require a shared or spoken language until you revert back to your non-hybrid form. You can use this action while transformed to remove the hood and return to your original form.
