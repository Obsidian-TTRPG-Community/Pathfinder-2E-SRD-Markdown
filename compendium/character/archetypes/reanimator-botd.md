# Reanimator *Dedication Level 2*  

Most cultures revere the bodies of the deceased, laying to rest the mortal remains of their companions according to tradition formed generations before. Such customs assume a common conclusion: once the spirit that inhabited it has gone on to the Boneyard, the empty shell of a corpse has no purpose beyond its eventual return to the elements that formed it. You know differently. As the vessels that once housed immortal souls, corpses hold great power and potential, perfect construction materials for creations of unsurpassed wonder. As a reanimator, you have chosen to focus your study of the necromantic arts on the transformation of dead flesh into innumerable varieties of undead, from the lowliest shuffling corpses and brittle skeletons to abominations of ghastly splendor barely conceived of by only the most fanatical—or brilliant—mortal minds.

# Reanimator Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: able to cast [animate dead](compendium/spells/animate-dead-apg.md) with a spell slot

You have dedicated your studies to the art of raising and commanding undead. If you're a spontaneous spellcaster with animate dead in your repertoire, it becomes a signature spell in addition to your usual signature spells. If you're a prepared spellcaster with animate dead in your spells known, spellbook, or the like, you can spend 10 minutes contemplating undeath to replace one of the spells you've prepared in your spell slots with an [animate dead](compendium/spells/animate-dead-apg.md) spell of the same level. In addition, if you're able to target the mostly intact remains of an appropriate type of dead creature when casting animate dead, the undead you animate gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, AC, saving throws, and skill checks for the duration of animate dead.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the reanimator archetype.

Your presence has a bolstering effect on your undead minions. Undead creatures under your control and within a 30-foot emanation around you gain a +2 status bonus to saving throws to resist positive damage and to Will saving throws to resist effects that would make them [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled).

# Deathly Secrets  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Reanimator Dedication](compendium/feats/reanimator-dedication-botd.md)

No means of creating or ruling the undead is beyond your grasp, even those of magical traditions not your own. You learn either the [eyes of the dead](compendium/spells/eyes-of-the-dead-botd.md) or [subjugate undead](compendium/spells/subjugate-undead-botd.md) focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) by meditating over the earthly remains of a dead sentient creature. Focus spells granted by the reanimator archetype are from the same tradition as those used to meet the archetype's prerequisite.

**Special.** You can select this feat more than once. Each time, you learn a different spell and your focus pool increases by 1 Focus Point.

- **Prerequisites**: [Reanimator Dedication](compendium/feats/reanimator-dedication-botd.md); expert in [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion)

Any necromancer can create zombies and skeletons, but you know the secrets behind the creation of far more advanced undead monstrosities. You learn the [create undead](compendium/spells/rituals/create-undead.md) rituals to create two types of common undead for which you meet the prerequisites. (Your GM might give you access to additional types of undead.) You can't teach these rituals to anyone else and you can't participate in either ritual while allowing someone else to serve as the primary caster unless they also know the ritual. When you reach a new level, you can change either or both of these rituals to a different type of undead for which you now meet the prerequisites.

When acting as primary caster, you can perform all [create undead](compendium/spells/rituals/create-undead.md) rituals in 4 hours instead of 1 day and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your primary check. You can also perform the ritual without the aid of a secondary caster, in which case you attempt the secondary check.

**Special.** You can select this feat more than once. Each time, you learn the rituals to create two more types of undead creatures.

You sway with the motions of your spells that animate the dead, channeling your power to sustain two at the same time. You Sustain your previous casting of animate dead, binding the necromantic energy of the two spells together with metaphysical twine. On subsequent rounds, you can Sustain both [animate dead](compendium/spells/animate-dead-apg.md) spells with a single action to [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md). This benefit lasts until either of the spells ends.

- **Prerequisites**: able to create or control undead; cleric with a negative font, oracle of bones, or necromancer wizard

Necromantic energy demonstrates your power over undead, creating a demeanor that commands their fear and respect. Undead creatures can immediately sense your Necromancer's Visage and tend to act accordingly. If you take a hostile action against an undead creature, it becomes permanently immune to your Necromancer's Visage, and your Necromancer's Visage ends. You can spend 10 minutes to restore your Necromancer's Visage, though any creatures that became permanently immune remain so.

Each time an undead creature 2 or more levels lower than you attacks you, it must attempt a Will save against your spell DC. If you're also affected by [sanctuary](compendium/spells/sanctuary.md) or a similar effect, only one affects the attacker (you choose which).

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is permanently immune to your Necromancer's Visage.
> - **Success** The creature can attempt its attack and any other attacks against you this turn.
> - **Failure** The creature can't attack you and wastes the action. It can't attempt further attacks against you this turn.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature wastes the action and can't attempt to attack you as long as your Necromancer's Visage persists.

**Special.** This feat has the trait matching your spellcasting tradition.

- **Prerequisites**: ability to permanently create or control undead;  cleric with a negative font, oracle of bones, or necromancer wizard
- **Requirements**: You have at least one undead minion that you permanently control.
- **Activity** Single Action

You repurpose the negative energy that flows through your minions at a moment's notice. Instantly destroy one undead minion within 60 feet that is permanently under your control. If your next action is to cast a necromancy spell from a spell slot, you don't expend the slot. The spell's level must be half the destroyed minion's level or lower and the spell can't have a duration.

**Special.** This feat has the trait matching your spellcasting tradition.
