- **Prerequisites**: Trained in [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature)

You gain the services of a young animal companion that travels with you and obeys simple commands as best as it can. This trained animal is trained in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) instead of the skill listed for its type.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the animal trainer archetype.

- **Prerequisites**: [Animal Trainer Dedication](compendium/feats/animal-trainer-dedication-ec2.md)

Your animal companion grows up, becoming a mature animal companion. Increase its proficiency rank in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) to expert instead of one of the three skill increases for mature. It gains the Mesmerizing Performance advanced maneuver, rather than the normal advanced maneuver for its type.

- **Requirements**: The companion's last action was a successful [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check to [Perform](rules/actions/perform.md).
- **Activity**: Single Action

The companion maintains its performance to captivate a single target within 30 feet that witnessed its successful performance. The target must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected and temporarily immune for 1 hour
> - **Failure** The target is [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) by the companion for its next action and then is temporarily immune for 1 hour.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) by the companion for 1 round. While it remains [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), it can't use reactions.
