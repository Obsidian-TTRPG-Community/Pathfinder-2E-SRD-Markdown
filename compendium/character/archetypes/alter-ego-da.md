# Alter Ego *Dedication Level 2*  

> [!pf2-sidebar] Alter Egos in Golarion
> See page 127 of Dark Archive

A highly guarded castle in the middle of an extravagant ball, the headquarters of a city's infamous thieves' guild, the locked room in the back of a cultist hideout—all perfect targets for you to use your expertise at blending in. Rather than skulking through the shadows, you use your training and latent supernatural abilities to become a mirror, playing on the perceptions of others and taking on whatever role necessary to get in and out of your destination before anyone has a chance to think something is amiss.

Performing an alter ego means going unregarded. Passing as just a face in the crowd is crucial, and accolades come as the gratitude from your leaders or coin from your clients, rather than the awed adoration from a crowd. This arrangement might suit you fine, as you thrive in a job well done and on the thrill of walking flagrantly past your duped adversaries. Or it might become pent up, until you can't resist a dramatic reveal or a signature calling card that shows you were there. One final word before speeding away from the castle, a gloating message left behind, or some other sign reveals your skill—usually too late for your victims to do anything about it.

# Alter Ego Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) and [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth)

You make yourself into a living mirror, becoming a double of someone unremarkable, and you slip into exactly the role that can get you past security or into a sensitive facility. You become an expert in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception). You gain the Assume a Role activity.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Assume a Role
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You've spent at least 1 hour studying a creature whose role you intend to copy and have done so within the last 3 days. This could include meeting and learning from someone in that role, tailing and spying on someone, using magic to observe them at work, or some other method, as long as you have a visual source of information

**Effect** You quickly and accurately learn how to do mundane jobs or at least copy the movements enough to appear as if you do. A chosen role can take many forms—from cook, cleaner, or librarian to cult member, priest, or duke—but it's always a role and never a specific individual.

You perform the [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) activity to pass as a member of the role you [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed) and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to any [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks you attempt in your impersonation. This takes the normal amount of time it takes you to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md). You also choose one [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill relevant to that role (such as [Farming Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) for a farmer). While in your role, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks for that [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill, and if you're untrained in it, you can use your level as your proficiency bonus.

You stop assuming the role after 24 hours, if you start studying for a new role, or if you choose to.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the alter ego archetype.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Alter Ego Dedication](compendium/feats/alter-ego-dedication-da.md)

You know that for the best disguise to work, one requires not only the right skills but also the right look—luckily you can copy both using special magical techniques. When you [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md), you don't need a disguise kit; instead, simple illusions or temporary transmutations ripple over your body like mirror shards, providing the supplies that the kit ordinarily would. When you [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) in this way, your [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) activity gains the [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait") trait.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Alter Ego Dedication](compendium/feats/alter-ego-dedication-da.md)

When you take on a role, you become more capable with all sorts of tasks involving that role. When you Assume a Role, choose two skills associated with the role in some way; if you're untrained, you can use your level as your proficiency bonus for those skills, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with those skills as long as you remain in that role. You and the GM determine which skills you assume.

- **Prerequisites**: [Alter Ego Dedication](compendium/feats/alter-ego-dedication-da.md)

People often only see what they want to see, a weakness you know how to take full advantage of. While you've Assumed a Role, you can use [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) in place of [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) when using the [Avoid Notice](rules/actions/avoid-notice.md) exploration activity in an area where someone with your role wouldn't be unusual, such as when impersonating a sailor or fisher when infiltrating the docks.

# Sound Mirror  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Alter Ego Dedication](compendium/feats/alter-ego-dedication-da.md)

You twist not just the visual, but the auditory as well, allowing you to pass without a sound and create minor noises as distractions—perfect for misdirection and infiltration. You can cast [silence](compendium/spells/silence.md) on yourself as a 2nd-level innate occult spell and [ventriloquism](compendium/spells/ventriloquism.md) as a 1st-level innate occult spell, both once per day. You also can cast [ghost sound](compendium/spells/ghost-sound.md) as an innate occult cantrip. You become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your key spellcasting ability is Charisma.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Alter Ego Dedication](compendium/feats/alter-ego-dedication-da.md); trained in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics), master in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception)

- **Activity** Reaction

[Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md), or [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) attempt.

Your study of another allows you to mirror their movements subtly, even in the heat of combat. You study the successful maneuver of an enemy and instinctively learn to do it. The next time you take the same action they did, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check, or a +2 circumstance bonus if the enemy critically succeeded on their triggering action. You lose this benefit if you don't use it before the end of your next turn.

- **Prerequisites**: [Alter Ego Dedication](compendium/feats/alter-ego-dedication-da.md)
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Activity** Two-Action

You've learned how to use even your reflection to your advantage. You send your own reflection to forcibly swap places with the reflection of an enemy, pulling each of you through opposite ends and switching places. The enemy must be within 120 feet, you must both be adjacent to reflective surfaces (such as glass, mirrors, or calm water), and you must be able to see the target's reflection and have line of effect to it. The target attempts a Will save against your spell DC or class DC, whichever is higher.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The spell has no effect.
> - **Success** You swap positions with your target or arrive adjacent to your target, whichever your target prefers.
> - **Failure** You swap positions with your target or arrive adjacent to your target, whichever you prefer.
> - **Critical Failure** You instantaneously swap positions with your target, and the target becomes trapped in its own reflection for 1 minute. Once on each of its turns, the target can spend 1 action to attempt another Will save to escape. If the save succeeds, the effect ends early.

# Borrow Memories  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Borrow Memories](compendium/feats/borrow-memories-da.md) is intended for use with the Alter Ego Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Prerequisites**: [Alter Ego Dedication](compendium/feats/alter-ego-dedication-da.md)

Knowing how someone thinks makes it much easier to know where they'll be, or even replace them altogether. You can cast [mind probe](compendium/spells/mind-probe.md) as an innate occult spell once per day, using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

If you cast [mind probe](compendium/spells/mind-probe.md) on a target you're studying for the purpose of Assuming their Role, and the target fails their save, you can delay the spell from coming into effect until you Assume their Role. When you use the spell this way, you can Sustain it up to 10 times during its duration, asking a question each time. The spell lasts until you ask all 10 questions or are no longer Assuming the Role, whichever comes first. You don't need to [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) to extend its duration—only when asking a question—nor do you need to be in range or have line of effect to Sustain it.
