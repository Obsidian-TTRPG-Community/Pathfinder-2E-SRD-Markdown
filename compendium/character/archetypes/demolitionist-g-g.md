# Demolitionist *Dedication Level 2*  

As rippling explosions bring a castle's walls tumbling down, you grin and wipe the stone dust of your handiwork from your face. Brute force might work for others, but applying science to place the right explosives in just the right spot is essential to your craft.

You know how to set explosives to cause the maximum possible damage to buildings and other structures. You become trained in [Engineering Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) or become an expert in it if you were already trained. You gain the Set Explosives action.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Set Explosives** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") ([concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md))

- **Requirements**: You have 1 or 2 bombs in hand

**Effect** You attach the bombs to an inanimate object within your reach, such as a door, wall, or column, and rig them to detonate at a set time. The bombs explode at a specific time you determine (such as after your next action or at the start of your next turn, to a maximum of 1 minute), dealing their damage and [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage to the inanimate object. Combine this damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses, and this damage ignores an amount of the object's Hardness equal to your level. Any creatures adjacent to the hazard take the bombs' [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage, also combined for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. As a reminder, since you didn't throw the bombs, Calculated Splash and similar effects don't apply. Making sure your timing is correct requires concentration, so you can't Set Explosives again while you're waiting for a previously set bomb to detonate.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the demolitionist archetype.

You can rig your bombs to inanimate objects in order to cause destruction to the surrounding area. As an activity that takes 1 minute, you attach between one and four bombs to an inanimate object within your reach, such as a chest, door, wall, or column. This creates a hazard in one square occupied by or adjacent to the inanimate object, and the hazard's [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) DC to detect it and [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC to disable it are equal to your class DC.

The hazard has the following reaction, which you can also trigger as a single action so long as you are within 30 feet of the hazard. The hazard retains its potency until it's triggered, until the inanimate object moves from its space, or until you make your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Fire in the Hole** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature moves into the hazard's space

**Effect** The hazard explodes, dealing the bombs' damage and [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage to the inanimate object. Combine this damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses, and this damage ignores an amount of the object's Hardness equal to your level. Any creatures adjacent to the hazard take the bombs' [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage, similarly combined for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.

As a reminder, since you didn't throw the bombs, Calculated Splash and similar effects don't apply.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Demolitionist Dedication](compendium/feats/demolitionist-dedication-g-g.md)

You're often careful to be sure you're not hoisted on your own petard, or anyone else's, for that matter. When you have cover from a bomb, you gain resistance to damage caused by that bomb equal to half your level, plus a value equal to the circumstance bonus to AC granted by the cover. You gain these benefits against your own bombs regardless of whether you have cover.

You have calculated all the angles to maximize a bomb's splash. When you throw an alchemical bomb with the [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") trait, you can cause the bomb to deal [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) instead of the normal amount.

- **Prerequisites**: [Demolitionist Dedication](compendium/feats/demolitionist-dedication-g-g.md), master in [Engineering Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You know exactly how to make a memorable entrance... by detonating a bomb to produce a devastating explosion, of course! You Set Explosives on a door, window, container, or heavy gate. When the explosives detonate, you can attempt an [Engineering Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check to [Force Open](rules/actions/force-open.md) the target. If a bomb would add an item bonus to attack rolls, add that item bonus to your [Engineering Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check. Since you're blasting your way in, you can't avoid breaking the object or structure. If you roll a critical success, you get a success instead.

- **Prerequisites**: [Demolitionist Dedication](compendium/feats/demolitionist-dedication-g-g.md); [Calculated Splash](compendium/feats/calculated-splash.md), [Directional Bombs](compendium/feats/directional-bombs.md), or [Expanded Splash](compendium/feats/expanded-splash.md)

You maximize the effectiveness of your explosives by controlling every possible parameter of the blast meticulously. If you have the [Directional Bombs](compendium/feats/directional-bombs.md) feats, you can use it with Set Explosives or Demolition Charge, even though you didn't throw the bombs. If you have the [Calculated Splash](compendium/feats/calculated-splash.md) or [Expanded Splash](compendium/feats/expanded-splash.md) feats, you can apply the additional [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage to one of the bombs when you Set Explosives or use Demolition Charge, and you can apply the increased splash area from [Expanded Splash](compendium/feats/expanded-splash.md) to all the bombs.

You can lob bombs with great force and a precise trajectory to angle the splash in a cone spraying in a single direction. When throwing an alchemical bomb with the [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") trait, instead of splashing all squares adjacent to the target, you can treat the target's space as the first affected square of a 15-foot cone directed away from you, potentially allowing you to avoid allies and splash deeper into enemy lines. If the target takes up more than a single square, the target's square closest to you is the first affected square of the cone.

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Collapse Wall](compendium/feats/collapse-wall-g-g.md) is intended for use with the Demolitionist Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Prerequisites**: [Demolitionist Dedication](compendium/feats/demolitionist-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Trigger** A creature moves into the bombs' splash area.
- **Requirements**: You're within 30 feet of an area where you rigged bombs on a wall, cliff face, or similar vertical surface with Set Explosives or Demolition Charge
- **Activity** Reaction

You detonate the required bombs in order to bring a wall down on a creature. If your bombs deal enough damage to reduce the wall's Hit Points below its [Broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) Threshold, the wall partially collapses on the creature. The creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to the damage dealt to the wall (basic Reflex save; the DC for this save is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). On a failure, they must spend an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to dig themselves out of the collapse, and on a critical failure, they must spend 2 [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions to do so.

- **Prerequisites**: [Calculated Splash](compendium/feats/calculated-splash.md)

The particularly volatile compounds that you brew into your bombs result in them creating especially large and powerful explosions. When you throw an [alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait") [bomb](rules/traits/bomb.md "Bomb Item Trait") and that bomb has the [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") trait, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the bomb's usual [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage, and it deals [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage to every creature within 10 feet of the target.
