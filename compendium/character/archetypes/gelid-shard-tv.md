# Gelid Shard *Dedication Level 2*  

_Gelid shards_ are arcane focuses of refined magical cold in physical form. Unfortunately for their creator, _gelid shards_ do not grant immortality, though mortal creatures bonded to them do often have slightly longer lifespans thanks to the preserving cold that inundates and surrounds them.

> This archetype is a part of the [Gelid Shard](compendium/equipment/items/gelid-shard-tv.md) artifact.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  


The gelid shard within your heart may sap your ability to feel and experience emotion, but it also lets you create and manipulate cold. You learn to cast spontaneous spells and gain the [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) activity. You gain a spell repertoire with the [frost's touch](compendium/spells/frosts-touch-tv.md) and [ray of frost](compendium/spells/ray-of-frost.md) cantrips. You're trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for arcane spells.

Your key spellcasting ability is Charisma.

Your magical power grows as the shard's icy influence spreads ever deeper into your being. You gain the basic spellcasting benefits. Each time you gain a spell slot of a new level from this archetype, add a spell of the appropriate spell level (including heightened versions of lower-level spells) to your repertoire, either a common spell of the arcane tradition that has the [cold](rules/traits/cold.md) trait or another cold spell you have access to.

Snow and ice are no hindrance to you. You ignore difficult terrain caused by snow and ice, treat greater difficult terrain created by snow and ice as difficult terrain, and leave no tracks when moving through areas of snow or ice.

Your attunement to arcane cold enhances the depths of your growing power. Increase the number of spells in your repertoire and number of spell slots you gain from gelid shard archetype feats by 1 for each spell level other than your two highest gelid shard spell slots.

Your eyes are accustomed to the harsh glare of the sun on snow and ice. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against effects that inflict the [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) condition.

Snow doesn't impair your vision; you ignore concealment from snowfall. Your skin becomes cold to the touch, and sometimes frost forms on you. You are protected from severe cold and heat.

Whether in the heart of a volcanic passageway or the glacial tundras of the Crown of the World, the only temperature you ever personally experience is an oddly comfortable chill. You are now protected from extreme cold and extreme heat, and you gain resistance to fire equal to half your level. If you would already have resistance to fire equal to half your level from a heritage, ancestry feat, class feat, or another archetype feat, you instead gain resistance to fire equal to your level.

You can't be impeded by [environmental](rules/traits/environmental.md) effects that rely on cold or its byproducts. You ignore greater difficult terrain caused by snow and ice.

You are as much a creature of cold as whatever ancestry you were born to. You are immune to cold damage and gain the [cold](rules/traits/cold.md) trait. You automatically succeed on saving throws against effects that have the [cold](rules/traits/cold.md) trait.
