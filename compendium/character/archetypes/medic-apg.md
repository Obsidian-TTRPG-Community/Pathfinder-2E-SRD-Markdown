# Medic *Dedication Level 2*  

You've studied countless techniques for providing medical aid, making you a peerless doctor and healer.

collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine), [Battle Medicine](compendium/feats/battle-medicine.md)

You become an expert in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine). When you succeed with [Battle Medicine](compendium/feats/battle-medicine.md) or [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md), the target regains 5 additional HP at DC 20, 10 HP at DC 30, or 15 HP at DC 40. Once per day, you can use [Battle Medicine](compendium/feats/battle-medicine.md) on a creature that's temporarily immune. If you're a master in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine), you can do so once per hour.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the medic archetype.

title: Doctor's Visitation, Feat 4
collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [flourish](rules/traits/flourish.md "Flourish Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Medic Dedication](compendium/feats/medic-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Varies ([>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") OR [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action"))

You move to provide immediate care to those who need it. [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), then use one of the following: [Battle Medicine](compendium/feats/battle-medicine.md) or [Treat Poison](rules/actions/treat-poison.md). You can spend a second action to instead [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) and then [Administer First Aid](rules/actions/administer-first-aid.md) or [Treat a Condition](compendium/feats/treat-condition-apg.md) (if you have it).

title: Treat Condition, Feat 4
collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [healing](rules/traits/healing.md "Healing Effect Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Medic Dedication](compendium/feats/medic-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You are holding healer's tools, or you are wearing them and have a hand free.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You treat an adjacent creature in an attempt to reduce the [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy), [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled), or [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition. If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one. Attempt a counteract check against the condition, using your [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) modifier as your counteract modifier and the condition's source to determine the DC. You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you have [Legendary Medic](compendium/feats/legendary-medic.md); even if you do, the counteract DC increases by 10. Treating a Condition that is continually applied under certain circumstances (for instance, the [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition a good character gains from carrying an [unholy weapon](compendium/equipment/items/unholy.md)) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Reduce the condition value by 2.
> - **Success** Reduce the condition value by 1.
> - **Critical Failure** Increase the condition value by 1.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), [Treat Condition](compendium/feats/treat-condition-apg.md)

You provide emotional and spiritual care.

Add [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied), and [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) to the list of conditions you can reduce with Treat Condition. If the [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) condition has a duration instead of a value, you can't use Treat Condition to reduce it.

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Resuscitate](compendium/feats/resuscitate-apg.md) is intended for use with the Medic Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Prerequisites**: [Medic Dedication](compendium/feats/medic-dedication-apg.md), legendary in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine)
- **Requirements**: You are holding healer's tools or are wearing them and have a hand free.
- **Activity** Three-Action

You can use [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) to resuscitate the dead. Attempt a DC 40 [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of [raise dead](compendium/spells/raise-dead.md), except it still has the [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition it had before [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying), increased by 1 (or [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) if it wasn't [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) before [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying)). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day.
