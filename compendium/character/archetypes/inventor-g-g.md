# Inventor *Dedication Level 2*  

You revel in the creation of clever inventions, deploying your brilliance to defeat your foes. Explosives, gadgets, and innovative technologies? You have ideas for all of them, and you're eager to test your theories.

## Multiclass Inventor characters
<sup>G&G p. 49</sup>

Inventor is a great fit for intelligent characters looking to branch out and learn new tricks, especially alchemists, who are already good at [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) and may appreciate [unstable](rules/traits/unstable-g-g.md "Unstable  Trait") options as an alternative to daily alchemical resources. If they meet the Intelligence requirements, clerics of deities who encourage invention and experimentation like [Brigh](compendium/setting/deities/brigh-logm.md) are an amazing fit, both because it makes narrative sense and because such characters can usually [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) while fixing their innovation after using an [unstable](rules/traits/unstable-g-g.md "Unstable  Trait") ability.
