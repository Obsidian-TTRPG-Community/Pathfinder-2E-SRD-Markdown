# Archaeologist *Dedication Level 2*  

Adventurers raid tombs for material gain, but true archaeologists treasure the knowledge gained from such sites. You might accomplish your goals with scholarly learning, by training to overcome the tricks and traps set by ancient peoples and rivals, through magical training, or even with a bit of inexplicable luck.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Archaeologist Dedication](compendium/feats/archaeologist-dedication-apg.md)

While study is key to your success, a bit of magic is a helpful tool in discovering the secrets of the past. You gain [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md), [guidance](compendium/spells/guidance.md), and [read aura](compendium/spells/read-aura.md) as occult innate cantrips.

- **Prerequisites**: [Archaeologist Dedication](compendium/feats/archaeologist-dedication-apg.md)

Your studies open up new horizons. You become an expert in a [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill about a specific settlement; if you were already trained in that [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill, you also become trained in the [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill for a different settlement of your choice. Choose a single common or uncommon language prevalent in that settlement. You learn that language.

**Special.** You can take this feat multiple times. When you take this feat again, choose a different settlement.

[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Trap Finder (Rogue)](compendium/feats/trap-finder-rogue.md) is intended for use with the Archaeologist Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.


You have an intuitive sense that alerts you to the dangers and presence of traps. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to find traps, to AC against attacks made by traps, and to saves against traps. Even if you aren't [Searching](rules/actions/search.md), you get a check to find traps that normally require you to be [Searching](rules/actions/search.md). You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap.

You can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of master in [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery). If you have master proficiency in [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery), you can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of legendary instead, and your circumstance bonuses against traps increase to +2.

- **Prerequisites**: [Archaeologist Dedication](compendium/feats/archaeologist-dedication-apg.md), [Magical Scholastics](compendium/feats/magical-scholastics-apg.md)

You broaden your magical studies, allowing you to find the right path, detect objects, and conceal those objects from unscrupulous rivals. You can cast [augury](compendium/spells/augury.md), [locate](compendium/spells/locate.md), and [nondetection](compendium/spells/nondetection.md) as occult innate spells, each once per day. You can cast this [nondetection](compendium/spells/nondetection.md) spell only on an object, and it is automatically heightened to the same spell level as your cantrips from Magical Scholastics.
