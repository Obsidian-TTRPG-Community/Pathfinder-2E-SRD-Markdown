[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: You are from the Golden Road region.
- **Prerequisites**: Ancient Osiriani and Sphinx languages, trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

You've begun to inscribe a magical stone called a ka stone that you will some day tie to your soul. You gain knowledge of Ancient Osirion and a connection to your nascent ka stone. If you fail a recovery check while [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying), your [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition does not increase; if you critically fail, your [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition increases by only 1. You become trained in [Ancient Osirion Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), or expert if you were already trained.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the living monolith archetype.

title: Ka Stone Ritual, Feat 4
collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Living Monolith Dedication](compendium/feats/living-monolith-dedication-lowg.md), a sphinx or living monolith with this feat performs a ritual with you

You inscribe your true name on your ka stone, as well as oaths to gods and pharaohs, and embed it in your forehead in a special ritual with a sphinx or with a living monolith who already has this feat. The ka stone is an invested magic item that you automatically invest each day. It can't be removed without your permission, nor can it be dispelled, and you can never lose investiture in the ka stone. Its Bulk is negligible.

The ka stone grants you a +1 item bonus to saves against [death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait") effects and [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait") effects, which increases to +2 at 8th level, +3 at 14th level, and +4 at 20th level.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") envision, or a different activation if otherwise specified

- **Frequency**: a number of times each day equal to the number of class feats you have from the [Living Monolith](compendium/character/archetypes/living-monolith-lowg.md) archetype

**Effect** You cast [enlarge](compendium/spells/enlarge.md) on yourself or use one of the other activated abilities granted by a later [Living Monolith](compendium/character/archetypes/living-monolith-lowg.md) feat.

collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ka Stone Ritual](compendium/feats/ka-stone-ritual-lowg.md)

You can selectively stop your bleeding with ease. Reduce the DC of flat checks to stop [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) you have from 15 to 10, and you can use a single action that has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait to gain an early flat check without physically binding the wounds.

You recover naturally from the [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) condition twice as quickly as normal.
