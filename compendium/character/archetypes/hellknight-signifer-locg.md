# Hellknight Signifer *Dedication Level 6*  

Signifers are the powerful and enigmatic Hellknight spellcasters who support and sometimes lead other Hellknights on their missions to enforce unwavering law. Formidable in their own right, signifers are trained to be unstoppable forces of order and authority when they stand alongside their martial counterparts.

# Hellknight Signifer Dedication  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: spellcasting class feature, [Hellknight Armiger Dedication](compendium/feats/hellknight-armiger-dedication-lowg.md), lawful alignment, member of a Hellknight order, passed the Hellknight Test

You have bolstered your force of will with the power of the Measure and the Chain. Upon initiation, you receive a signifer mask, often devoid of eyeholes or other decorative features. The mask doesn't obscure your vision, though it makes it impossible for others to see your eyes. While wearing your signifer's mask, you gain +1 circumstance bonus to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks to [Lie](rules/actions/lie.md), [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks, and [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) DCs against [Sense Motive](rules/actions/sense-motive.md). You gain expert proficiency in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) (or in another skill in which you're trained of your choice, if you were already an expert in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation)) as well as in your choice of [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion).

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Hellknight signifer or Hellknight armiger archetypes.

- **Prerequisites**: [Hellknight Signifer Dedication](compendium/feats/hellknight-signifer-dedication-locg.md)

The magic flowing through your signifer's mask allows you to see in the dark, and the mask dampens the distraction caused by sudden flashes of bright light. While wearing your signifer's mask, you gain [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md). Additionally, if you are [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) while wearing your signifer's mask and the target is [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) only because you are [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled), you reduce the flat check DC to target that creature from 5 to 3.
