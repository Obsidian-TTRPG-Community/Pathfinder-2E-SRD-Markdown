# Dual-Weapon Warrior *Dedication Level 2*  

You're able to effortlessly fight with multiple weapons simultaneously, weaving your weapons together into a storm of quick attacks. To you, continual offense is the best form of defense, and you leave little room for your foes to avoid your whirlwind of weapons.

# Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md)  


You're exceptional in your use of two weapons. You gain the [Double Slice](compendium/feats/double-slice.md) fighter feat. This serves as Double Slice for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the dual-weapon warrior archetype.

# Dual Thrower  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication](compendium/feats/dual-weapon-warrior-dedication-apg.md)

You know how to throw two weapons as easily as strike with them. Whenever a dual-weapon warrior feat allows you to make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), you can instead make a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a thrown weapon or a one-handed ranged weapon you are wielding. Any effects from these feats that apply to one-handed melee weapons or melee [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) also apply to one-handed ranged weapons and ranged [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md).

- **Requirements**: You are wielding two one-handed weapons, each in a different hand, one of which is a ranged weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

You carry your ammunition in a way that allows you to reload while holding two weapons. You [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to reload a one-handed ranged weapon you're holding. Unlike most [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions, you don't need a free hand to reload your ranged weapon in this way.

- **Requirements**: You are wielding two melee weapons, one in each hand.
- **Activity** Single Action

You use your two weapons to parry attacks. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, or a +2 circumstance bonus if either weapon has the [parry](rules/traits/parry.md) trait. You lose this circumstance bonus if you no longer meet this feat's requirement.

# Flensing Slice  [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication](compendium/feats/dual-weapon-warrior-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: Your last action was a Double Slice, and both attacks hit the target.
- **Activity** Single Action

When you hit with both attacks with Double Slice, you flense the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot. The target takes `1d8` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) per weapon damage die of whichever of the weapons you used that has the most weapon damage dice (maximum `4d8` for a major striking weapon). The target becomes [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed), and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of your next turn.

- **Trigger** A creature within your reach critically fails a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against you.
- **Requirements**: You are benefiting from [Twin Parry](compendium/feats/twin-parry-fighter.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

A clever parry with one weapon leaves your opponent open to an attack with the other weapon. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or use a [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) action against the triggering opponent.

- **Prerequisites**: Dual-Weapon Dedication

When you lash out with both weapons, you leave no room for the target to escape your attack. When you use [Double Slice](compendium/feats/double-slice.md), if you miss with both [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), choose one of the two weapons and apply the effects of a hit with that weapon. You can't choose a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was a critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if both attack rolls were critical failures.
