# Poisoner *Dedication Level 2*  

People are so delightfully fragile when exposed to the glories of nature. The bite of a certain serpent makes the blood congeal to jelly. A particular stone, suitably powdered, causes hallucinations and delirium. The sap of a tree inflicts such pain that death seems preferable. You are a student of such dark wonders, making you a dangerous foe indeed.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

You make a point of always having a few toxins near at hand—you never know when some arsenic or the like might prove useful. You gain the basic alchemy benefits (page 150), though they can be used only for alchemical poisons. You gain batches of infused reagents per day equal to your level. Your advanced alchemy level for creating these is 1 and doesn't increase on its own.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained at least two other feats from the poisoner archetype.

Repeated exposure to toxic reagents has fortified your body against poisons of all kinds. You gain poison resistance equal to half your level, and you gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against poisons.

- **Prerequisites**: [Poisoner Dedication](compendium/feats/poisoner-dedication-apg.md), trained in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine)
- **Requirements**: Your last action was a successful melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that dealt damage against a target that is afflicted by a poison, and you know which poison.
- **Activity** Single Action

Poisons attack specific parts of the body—one venom might target the lungs, another the circulatory system, while another deteriorates the nerves. You know how to take advantage of such weaknesses. You deal `1d6` damage of the required [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)'s damage type and `1d6` poison damage to the target. If you're at least 18th level, you deal `2d6` damage of each type.

You can capably deliver toxins with a blowgun. Your blowgun [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) can apply injury poisons even if they deal no damage due to a creature's resistance. If you critically succeed at an attack roll using a blowgun loaded with a dart you've poisoned and the target rolls a failure on the poison's initial save, the target critically fails instead.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Poisoner Dedication](compendium/feats/poisoner-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** A creature adjacent to you hits you with a melee unarmed [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
- **Requirements**: You have prepared your clothing to poison attackers (see below).
- **Activity** Reaction

In nature, certain animals are covered in venomous spines, such that even touching them is deadly. To use this reaction, you must have brushed poison onto your clothing or woven sharp poisoned needles into the garment's fabric. This takes 10 minutes and uses one dose of contact or injury poison. You can have only one such poison suffused into your clothing at a time.

When you use this reaction, the triggering creature is exposed to the suffused poison.

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a piercing or slashing weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

You apply a [poison](rules/traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait") to the required weapon; if you're not holding a poison and have a free hand, you can [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to draw a poison as part of this action. If your next attack with that weapon before the end of your next turn hits and deals damage, it applies the effects of the poison, provided that poison can be delivered by contact or injury. If you critically fail the attack roll, the poison is wasted as normal.

**Special.** During your daily preparations, you can prepare a number of simple injury poisons equal to your rogue level. These poisons deal `1d4` poison damage. Only you can apply these poisons properly, and they expire the next time you prepare.

Your victims tend to expire long before your poisons, since the latter have been specifically formulated to last longer. The maximum duration of any poison you create increases by an amount equal to the poison's stage 1 interval, to a maximum of twice the poison's maximum duration.

- **Prerequisites**: [Poisoner Dedication](compendium/feats/poisoner-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** You fail a save against a poison.
- **Activity** Reaction

A small amount of poison, taken at nonlethal doses, can help the body build up a resistance against a more deadly dosage. Reroll the triggering check and use the second result. Once you use Acquired Tolerance, you can continue to use it against the same type of poison that day, but you can't use it against a different type of poison until after you make your next daily preparations. For instance, if you used the reaction on a save against giant scorpion venom, you could use it again against giant scorpion venom even if it came from a different source, but you couldn't use it against nettleweed residue, lich dust, or another poison.

A combination of additional viscosity and careful application keeps your weapons poisoned even when suffering significant wear and tear. If your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a poisoned weapon would expend its poison without your target attempting an initial save (due to resistance or your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) being a critical failure, for example), attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned. If your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a poisoned weapon succeeds, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned until the end of your next turn.

You deliver poisons in ways that maximize their harmful effects. When you apply a simple poison with Poison Weapon, the poison deals `2d4` poison damage instead of `1d4` poison damage. You don't waste a poison you apply with Poison Weapon on a critically failed attack roll.

Unsuspecting targets are especially vulnerable to your poisons. When you successfully [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) a [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) creature with a poisoned weapon or expose a [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) creature to an inhaled poison, the [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) condition also gives that creature a –2 circumstance penalty to its initial save against that poison.

- **Trigger** A creature within 30 feet critically fails its initial saving throw against a poison you created.
- **Activity** Reaction

With carefully engineered enzymes, you coax some of your poison to infect another target, using the original victim as a carrier. A creature adjacent to the triggering creature is exposed to the triggering poison.
