# Trick Driver *Dedication Level 2*  

While cavaliers follow an old and tired tradition of mounted combat, you take a more modern road. Through aggressive use of vehicles, you roll across the battlefield, taking down your opponents. You go beyond simply operating a vehicle, pushing it to perform stunts that its builders never intended, transforming the vehicle into something much greater than a mere conveyance.

You are equally at home piloting any vehicle, adapting yourself instantly to varied controls, movements, and handling.

Whenever piloting a vehicle requires a [Piloting Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) or [Sailing Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check, you can use your [Driving Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) proficiency instead.

You can use Dexterity in place of Intelligence when attempting piloting checks with [Driving Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore). You become an expert in [Driving Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore). At 7th level, you become a master in [Driving Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), and at 15th level, you become legendary in [Driving Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore).

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the trick driver archetype.

- **Prerequisites**: [Trick Driver Dedication](compendium/feats/trick-driver-dedication-g-g.md)

You can optimize your vehicle's performance, coaxing extra speed and choosing paths to avoid slowdowns.

When calculating your travel speed for the day while piloting a vehicle, you can attempt a [Driving Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check to increase your vehicle's travel speed. The DC is determined by the GM but is typically based on the vehicle's piloting DC or a difficulty based on the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, increase your vehicle's travel speed by half. This has no effect on your vehicle's movement in encounters.

You [Drive](rules/actions/drive-gmg.md) with a â€“2 penalty to your piloting check, gaining the effects of the [Drive](rules/actions/drive-gmg.md) action for the same number of actions you spent to Power Slide. At the end of the movement, if you succeed, you can turn the vehicle up to 90 degrees. If you critically succeed at your piloting check, you can instead turn the vehicle up to 180 degrees.
