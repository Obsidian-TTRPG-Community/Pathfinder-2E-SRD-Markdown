# Knight Reclaimant *Dedication Level 6*  

Knights reclaimant spend much of their time amid the horrors of the Gravelands, rescuing civilians that remain and striking back against the Whispering Tyrant's agents. Accomplishing these goals requires the adoption of subtle tactics, with a focus on stealth and survival.

# Knight Reclaimant Dedication  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) and [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth), any non-evil alignment, member of the Knights of Lastwall of knight rank

You have sworn the Crimson Oath and become a full member of the Crimson Reclaimers. You gain expert proficiency in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) and [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival). Whenever you roll a success on a saving throw against an undead's special ability, you get a critical success instead. This applies to any abilities that come from being undead, including an undead's innate spells (but not its prepared or spontaneous spells).

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Knight Reclaimant archetype.

If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) activity to recite the Crimson Oath and meditate on its teachings; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your knight reclaimant focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.
