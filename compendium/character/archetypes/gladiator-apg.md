# Gladiator *Dedication Level 2*  

The roar of the crowd and thrill of competitive combat drive you to become the best—and the fame isn't bad either.

If there are sapient creatures observing a combat encounter, and these onlookers are neither engaged in the combat themselves nor allied or affiliated with either side, the combatants have spectators. The GM is the final arbiter.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Impressive Performance](compendium/feats/impressive-performance.md)

You know how to turn combat into a form of entertainment. You become trained in [Gladiatorial Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore); if already trained in [Gladiatorial Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), you instead become trained in another [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill of your choice.

At the start of a combat encounter, if you have spectators, you gain a number of temporary HP equal to your character level for 1 minute and you can roll [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) for your initiative.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the gladiator archetype.

You show off for the crowd. Attempt a [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check; the DC is determined by the GM but is typically the standard DC for your level or the DC to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on the spectators, whichever is higher. On a success, choose one of the following benefits; on a critical success, choose two benefits:

- A number of temporary Hit Points equal to your character level; these last for 1 minute.
- A +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.
- A +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll before the end of your next turn.
