# Hellknight *Dedication Level 6*  

Hellknights are among the fiercest warriors in the Inner Sea region, as they have emerged from hell-forged trials ready to serve as faceless bastions of law wherever chaos might threaten to rear.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hellknight Armiger Dedication](compendium/feats/hellknight-armiger-dedication-lowg.md), lawful alignment, member of a Hellknight order, passed the Hellknight Test

You have forged your body to comply with the commands of your mindâ€”orders steeped in the Measure and the Chain. You gain expert proficiency in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) (or in another skill in which you're trained of your choice, if you were already an expert in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation)). You gain the armor specialization effects of Hellknight plate, and your resistance from that armor specialization is 1 higher than normal. In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks while wearing your Hellknight plate.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Hellknight or Hellknight armiger archetypes.

title: Sense Chaos, Feat 8
collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Hellknight Dedication](compendium/feats/hellknight-dedication-locg.md)

You sense chaos as an unsettling feeling of nervous energy. When in the presence of an aura of chaos that is [powerful or overwhelming](rules/tables/alignment-aura.md), you eventually detect the aura, though you might not do so instantly and you can't pinpoint the location. This is a vague sense, similar to humans' sense of smell. A chaotic creature using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence attempts a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check against your [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC to hide its aura from you. If the creature succeeds at its [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check, it is temporarily immune to your Sense Chaos for 1 day.

You call upon the power of law and make a weapon or unarmed [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe you have witnessed breaking or disrespecting the law or otherwise acting disorderly. The [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) deals two extra weapon damage dice if the target of your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) is chaotic. Whether or not the target is chaotic, you can convert the physical damage from the attack into lawful damage.

- **Prerequisites**: [Hellknight Dedication](compendium/feats/hellknight-dedication-locg.md)

You've trained with your order's weapon and your Hellknight plate long enough to apply your expertise from other weapons and armor. If you have expert proficiency in any weapon or unarmed attack, you gain expert proficiency in your order's weapon as well. If you have expert proficiency in any armor or unarmored defense, you gain expert proficiency in Hellknight plate as well.

Hellknight Signifer Signifers are the powerful and enigmatic Hellknight spellcasters who support and sometimes lead other Hellknights on their missions to enforce unwavering law. Formidable in their own right, signifers are trained to be unstoppable forces of order and authority when they stand alongside their martial counterparts.

You gain the lesser order benefit of a Hellknight order other than the one to which you belong. This represents your time spent training with members of that order to learn their techniques and teachings. If you aren't in good standing with a given order, you can't receive their training.

**Special.** You can select this feat multiple times, gaining the lesser order benefit from a different order each time by training with members of that order.
