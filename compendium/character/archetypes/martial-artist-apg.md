# Martial Artist *Dedication Level 2*  

You have trained in the martial arts, making your unarmed strikes lethal. You seek neither mysticism nor enlightenment, and you don't view this training as some greater path to wisdom. Yours is the way of the fist striking flesh, the hand turning aside the blade, and the devastating kick taking your enemy down. Your training is focused and practical, and since you have turned every part of your body into a weapon, you never find yourself without one. While you might have learned your techniques in a dojo or school focused on training the body, you might just as easily have learned them in street brawls and bar fights, combining instincts with intense athleticism for a deadly combination.

# Martial Artist Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md)  


You have trained to use your fists as deadly weapons. The damage die for your fist unarmed attacks becomes `1d6` instead of `1d4`. You don't take the –2 circumstance penalty for making a lethal attack with your [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md) unarmed attacks.

Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank in all unarmed attacks.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the martial artist archetype.
