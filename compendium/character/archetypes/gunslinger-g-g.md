# Gunslinger *Dedication Level 2*  

You like a weapon that makes an impression almost as much as you like making an impression.

## Multiclass Gunslinger characters
<sup>G&G p. 127</sup>

Gunslinger is a great fit for dexterous characters who want a weapon that hits hard from a distance, especially rangers and rogues who already have abilities that can make their first hit count. Spellcasters with [true strike](compendium/spells/true-strike.md) might favor firearms with the [fatal](rules/traits/fatal.md "Fatal Weapon Trait") property and gunslinger abilities that improve options for supporting their allies.
