# Golem Grafter *Dedication Level 8*  

You have replaced a portion of your body with artifice of the kind used to create golems, fortifying your flesh with the unyielding might of magical constructs.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) and [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting), or an ally with expert proficiency in those skills willing to augment you

Your flesh has been specially treated with the same arcane and alchemical processes used to toughen the skin of flesh golems. Increase your maximum Hit Points by an amount equal to your level. You gain resistance to physical damage (except adamantine) equal to your number of class feats from the golem grafter archetype.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the golem grafter archetype.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Golem Grafter Dedication](compendium/feats/golem-grafter-dedication-ec3.md), expert in unarmed attacks

You have replaced one of your forearms with one made of clay and infused with cursed arcane magic. When you make an unarmed [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with your clay fist and hit, your target takes a â€“2 status penalty to saving throws against [curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait") effects for 1 hour.

**Special.** The damage die for your clay fist is `1d8`, and it loses the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait") and [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait") traits of a typical fist.

- **Prerequisites**: [Golem Grafter Dedication](compendium/feats/golem-grafter-dedication-ec3.md)
- **Frequency**: once per turn
- **Activity** Single Action

You've replaced your heart with one made of animated quicksilver and living adamantine. You reduce your [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) condition by 1. Alternatively, if you are not [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed), you are [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) during your next turn, and can use your extra action to [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) or [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Legs Of Stone](compendium/feats/legs-of-stone-ec3.md) is intended for use with the Golem Grafter Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Prerequisites**: [Golem Grafter Dedication](compendium/feats/golem-grafter-dedication-ec3.md)

You gain a +2 status bonus to your Fortitude and Reflex DCs against attempts to [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) or [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) you. You can [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) creatures even if you don't have a hand free. When you successfully [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) a foe, you can [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) away from your opponent (instead of toward it), but you must move the same distance in the opposite direction from where you Shoved it.
