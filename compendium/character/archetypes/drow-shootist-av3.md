[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in the [hand crossbow](compendium/equipment/items/hand-crossbow.md)

Every chance you get, you practice with the hand crossbow to increase your draw speed and accuracy. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the hand crossbow. If you're at least an expert in a hand crossbow you're using, you gain access to its critical specialization effect. You also gain the Shootist's Draw action.

```ad-embed-ability

- **Frequency**: once per round

**Effect** You [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to draw a hand crossbow and [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with it, or you [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a loaded hand crossbow you're already holding and then [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to stow it.
```

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the drow shootist archetype.

collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Drow Shootist Dedication](compendium/feats/drow-shootist-dedication-av3.md)

You become trained in the [repeating hand crossbow](compendium/equipment/items/repeating-hand-crossbow-g-g.md) and gain access to [repeating hand crossbows](compendium/equipment/items/repeating-hand-crossbow-g-g.md) and [shootist bandoliers](compendium/equipment/items/shootist-bandolier-av3.md). Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the repeating hand crossbow. If you're at least an expert in a [repeating hand crossbow](compendium/equipment/items/repeating-hand-crossbow-g-g.md) you're using, you gain access to its critical specialization effect. You can perform the Shootist's Draw action with [repeating hand crossbows](compendium/equipment/items/repeating-hand-crossbow-g-g.md).

**Special.** If you have the [Running Reload](compendium/feats/running-reload.md) feat, you can reload a repeating hand crossbow magazine on the move. You can use [Running Reload](compendium/feats/running-reload.md) as a 3-action activity to reload a magazine into a repeating hand crossbow after you [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), [Step](rules/actions/step.md), or [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md), or as a 2-action activity if you use a magazine from a shootist bandolier.

collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Drow Shootist Dedication](compendium/feats/drow-shootist-dedication-av3.md)
- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Requirements**: You're holding an unloaded [hand crossbow](compendium/equipment/items/hand-crossbow.md).
- **Activity** Single Action

You can fire off a single shot even when unprepared. You [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to reload your hand crossbow and [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with it.

**Special.** If you have the [Repeating Hand Crossbow Training](compendium/feats/repeating-hand-crossbow-training-av3.md) feat, you can use this feat with a [repeating hand crossbow](compendium/equipment/items/repeating-hand-crossbow-g-g.md) to load either a bolt or a magazine, but the speed means you can fire only one bolt, then the magazine jams. You must spend a 3-action [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) activity to remove the jammed magazine and clear it before it can be used again.

title: Lethargy Poisoner, Feat 8
collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Drow Shootist Dedication](compendium/feats/drow-shootist-dedication-av3.md), trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

You've learned more than the use of hand crossbows from drow lore. During your daily preparations, you can prepare a dose of [lethargy poison](compendium/equipment/items/lethargy-poison.md) from ordinary materials in a wilderness or urban area. If you're an expert in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting), you can instead craft a dose of [stupor poison](compendium/equipment/items/stupor-poison-av3.md). You can prepare two doses (of either poison) if you're a master in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) and three doses if you're legendary in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting). The save DC for this poison is equal to your class DC. Only you can use these poisons, and they expire the next time you make your daily preparations. The GM might decide that the area you're in is too barren to provide the materials you need for this feat.
