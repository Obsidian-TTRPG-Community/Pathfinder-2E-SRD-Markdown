[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: You speak at least three languages.

You have studied languages and their development. You become trained in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society); if you were already trained in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society), you instead become an expert in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society). You gain the [Multilingual](compendium/feats/multilingual.md) skill feat twice.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the linguist archetype.

- **Prerequisites**: [Linguist Dedication](compendium/feats/linguist-dedication-apg.md), expert in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society)

You use multiple languages to create and break codes. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Decipher Writing](rules/actions/decipher-writing.md). If another creature attempts to [Decipher Writing](rules/actions/decipher-writing.md) you encoded, they take a â€“2 circumstance penalty unless they speak all the languages you used when you created the writing.

- **Prerequisites**: [Linguist Dedication](compendium/feats/linguist-dedication-apg.md), expert in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society)

You can pronounce and repeat words with near-perfect accuracy even if you don't understand their meaning, and you can write them down in a phonetic script that allows you or another creature with Phonetic Training to read it later. Even if the words are in a language with sound you can't pronounce, you can faithfully transcribe them.

Memorizing long sequences of words remains just as difficult as it is normally.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Linguist Dedication](compendium/feats/linguist-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** Another creature within 60 feet uses a [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait") effect in a language you understand.
- **Activity** Reaction

You interpret a creature's words, repeating their message in a different language that you know. If the triggering effect's targets speak either the original language or the one you translated into, they are affected.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Linguist Dedication](compendium/feats/linguist-dedication-apg.md), expert in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) and [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society)

You break down a specific individual's idiolect, memorizing their speech mannerisms and habits. If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, when you later attempt to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) that individual, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks and DCs. Due to the intense character study required, you can't remember more than one idiolect at a time.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait")  [skill](rules/traits/skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Linguist Dedication](compendium/feats/linguist-dedication-apg.md), master in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society)

All communication is filled with slight tells and signals. If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, their regional words, pronunciation changes, and nonverbal cues provide you with a minor fact about their social environment, such as their hometown or certain groups they might belong to. If a target of this ability is being deceptive about their social environment, such as a commoner pretending to be a noble, they must attempt a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society), or appropriate [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check against your [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) DC, providing you a false minor fact consistent with their assumed identity on a success.

Once you've gleaned one or more true minor facts about a person, you can then incorporate these mannerisms into your speech to present yourself in a way that they find familiar. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to your [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) and [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks with them.

title: Crude Communication, Feat 8
collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Linguist Dedication](compendium/feats/linguist-dedication-apg.md)

Even if you don't speak a creature's language, you can rely on inflection, root words, and body language to infer rudimentary meaning. If you interact with a creature for at least 10 minutes and that creature can speak a language, the GM rolls a secret [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) check with a DC appropriate for the language's rarity. On a success, you understand the gist of the meaning and can communicate basic concepts back to the creature; on a failure, you are mistaken or communicate incorrect concepts. If you're legendary in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society), you can communicate instantly without needing to attempt a [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) check; even if you didn't know the medium of communication the creature uses (speech, sign language, and so on), you intuit this information as soon as they try to communicate.
