# Runelord *Dedication Level 2*  

You've learned arcane magic following the path of the runelords. You unlock secrets of a chosen school of magic while forsaking lesser schools. You learn the secrets of runic magic, the building blocks of magic. But be warned: you might succumb to sin in your pursuit of power.

You also learn to use polearms, the signature weapons of the runelords, and can acquire the secrets of the mighty, ancient magic items called aeon stones, embedding them into your skin.

## Runelord Specialization
<sup>SoM p. 240</sup>

You draw untold power from runes, sometimes called sin magic. You associate with one of the seven vices, also known as the seven rewards of rule: envy (abjuration), gluttony (necromancy), greed (transmutation), lust (enchantment), pride (illusion), sloth (conjuration), and wrath (evocation). Studying these techniques often tempts you with the associated sin. While leaning into it could corrupt you, it might make you more powerful. If you choose this class archetype, you must select [Runelord Dedication](compendium/feats/runelord-dedication-som.md) as your 2nd-level class feat.

**Prerequisites:** You must be a wizard specializing in one of the seven schools other than divination.

**Runelord Adjustments:** In addition to the normal school spell for your chosen school of magic, you learn the initial rune spell associated with your school, with its school adjusted to your chosen school of magic if it wasn't from that school already. The rune spells can be found below. Your pool of Focus Points increases to 2 Focus Points. At 8th level, you also learn the advanced rune spell associated with your school, also adjusting its school to match your chosen school of magic if it wasn't already, and your pool of Focus Points increases to 3 Focus Points.

You can [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) by indulging in your school's sin in lieu of studying your spellbook. As you become more powerful, your indulgence grows. At 12th level, if you indulge in your sin to [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md), if you have spent at least 2 Focus Points since the last time you [Refocused](rules/actions/refocus.md), you recover 2 Focus Points when you [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) instead of 1. At 18th level, if you indulge in your sin to [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md), if you have spent at least 3 Focus Points since the last time you [Refocused](rules/actions/refocus.md), you recover 3 Focus Points when you [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) instead of 1.

You are trained in martial polearms. At 11th level, if you gain weapon expertise, you become an expert in martial polearms.

Finally, you lose the ability to prepare or cast any spell from your school's prohibited schools. You remove all spells of those schools from your spell list, meaning you can't even activate scrolls or wands of such spells.

## The Seven Schools
<sup>SoM p. 240</sup>

The following seven schools are considered proper specializations of Thassilonian rune magic. In this paradigm, the Thassilonians considered divination magic to be something every wizard should learn but that none need take the effort to master.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md)  [class](rules/traits/class-som.md)  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md)  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: runelord specialization

Your rune magic increases, and you practice with your school's associated weapon. You gain an additional cantrip of your chosen arcane school, and each time you gain a level (including this level), you add an additional spell from your chosen arcane school to your spellbook, with the same restrictions as the two spells you normally add.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the runelord archetype.

- **Prerequisites**: [Runelord Dedication](compendium/feats/runelord-dedication-som.md), trained in [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)

You discover the secrets to embedding aeon stones into your flesh. You spend 1 day attuning to an aeon stone and physically embedding it in your skin. While the stone is embedded this way, you gain the benefits of the aeon stone as if it were orbiting above your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. Aeon stones in your flesh must be invested to function, as usual.

You can also use this activity to safely remove an embedded aeon stone in 1 day. Someone without this feat can attempt to surgically remove it safely by spending 1 day and succeeding at a DC 30 [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check, or hastily by simply ripping it from a corpse.

When you do, you gain one additional spell slot of any spell level up to two levels below the highest-level wizard spell you can cast. You can prepare only a spell of your specialized school in this slot. As with any other act, indulging in your sin might change your alignment if your behavior harms someone else.

During your daily preparations, you can magically fuse your arcane bonded weapon and a magical staff together into one item, with the staff making up the haft of the weapon.

While the two are fused, the weapon's haft takes on aesthetic aspects of the staff.

- **Prerequisites**: Counterspell, [Runelord Dedication](compendium/feats/runelord-dedication-som.md)

Your intricate knowledge of your school lets you easily negate spells from that school. Instead of being able to counter a foe's spell with Counterspell only if you have the same spell prepared, if the foe casts a spell from the school matching your specialization, you can Counterspell it with any other spell of the same school.

When you Counterspell a spell with a school matching your specialization, if you critically succeed at your counteract check, or if you succeed while using a spell of a higher level than the spell you countered, you can redirect the spell you countered. You choose the target, area, and other aspects of the spell and use your own spell DC, spell attack roll, or other statistics as appropriate to determine the effects.
