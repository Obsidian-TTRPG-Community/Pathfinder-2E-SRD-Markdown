# Horizon Walker *Dedication Level 2*  

Many long for the open road, but you prefer the trackless wild. You can find safe passage through the most inhospitable terrain in the worldâ€”icecaps, deserts, and similar environs are where you're comfortable. Your talents open untrod paths for you and help guide others through the wilderness.
