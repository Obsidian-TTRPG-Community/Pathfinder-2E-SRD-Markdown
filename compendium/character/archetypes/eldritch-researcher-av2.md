# Eldritch Researcher *Dedication Level 2*  

An eager student of occult lore, you enjoy reading rare or forgotten tomes with ancient rituals and hidden secrets. You connect disparate facts to unlock deeper mysteries and uncover the truths of the universe, and you zealously hoard the knowledge your painstaking research produces. Aberrations fascinate you for many reasons, not the least of which is because their anatomy is wholly alien and yet, to the insightful, eminently sensible.

You've been particularly enlightened by the accumulated lore in Thresholds of Truth, and you know Zarmavdian was a kindred soul in occult research. With this book in hand, you feel like you stand at the doorway to unprecedented occult discoveries.

You scoff at those fools who claim you meddle in things mortals aren't meant to know—for isn't it the duty of the enlightened to gather the universe's deepest truths?

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Trained in [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) and [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism)

You gain the ability to cast a single arcane or occult cantrip of your choice (which is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up). If you weren't already, you become trained in that tradition's spell DCs and spell attack rolls with Intelligence as your spellcasting ability.

Regardless of whether you choose an arcane or occult cantrip, you also become an expert in your choice of either [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) or [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism). You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks you attempt with the chosen skill when Investigating or [Identifying Magic](rules/actions/identify-magic.md).

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the Eldritch Researcher archetype.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Eldritch Researcher Dedication](compendium/feats/eldritch-researcher-dedication-av2.md)

Your devotion to discovering and hoarding abstruse truths borders on the fanatical, and you can bring this devotion to bear. You gain the cleric's Domain Initiate feat but must select knowledge, secrecy, or truth as your domain. You cast that domain's domain spell as a focus spell of the same tradition as your cantrip from Eldritch Researcher Dedication, and you [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) by contemplating abstruse mysteries rather than praying to a god. When an ability would manifest a divine symbol—such as the [word of truth](compendium/spells/word-of-truth.md) focus spell—it instead manifests as a strange shape unique to you that seems to defy geometry.

**Special.** You can take this feat up to three times, selecting a different domain each time.

- **Prerequisites**: [Eldritch Researcher Dedication](compendium/feats/eldritch-researcher-dedication-av2.md)

You have such familiarity with obscure texts that you can compel them to reveal their secrets. Once per day, you can touch a single text (such as a tome, a wall of hieroglyphics, or something similar) and understand its meaning for 1 hour. If the text is in multiple languages, you gain the ability to understand them all for only the purposes of reading the text. If the text is in a code or cypher, you don't automatically understand the text, but you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to decipher it.

- **Prerequisites**: [Eldritch Researcher Dedication](compendium/feats/eldritch-researcher-dedication-av2.md)

Your knowledge of strange creatures and their bizarre anatomy allows you to anticipate their physical attacks and reduce the damage you take from them. You gain resistance to physical damage from melee attacks made by aberrations and oozes. This resistance is equal to one-third your level.

You know that fate sometimes conspires to keep dangerous knowledge or items from the eyes of those most able to understand them. You deny fate the ability to conceal truths from you. You can cast [locate](compendium/spells/locate.md) as an innate occult spell once per day. When you reach 14th level, this spell is heightened to 5th level.

- **Prerequisites**: [Eldritch Researcher Dedication](compendium/feats/eldritch-researcher-dedication-av2.md)

You have unlocked abstruse methods to tangle with reality itself, altering the fate of a single individual. Once per day as an occult innate spell, you can cast [daydreamer's curse](compendium/spells/daydreamers-curse-av2.md), [outcast's curse](compendium/spells/outcasts-curse.md), or savant's curse. At the GM's discretion, you can substitute or add additional occult curse spells of 4th level or lower to this list. You can choose a different spell from the list each time you use this ability. If you couldn't already cast occult spells, these spells use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability, and you become trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells; if you could already cast occult spells, your proficiency in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells increases to expert.

- **Prerequisites**: [Eldritch Researcher Dedication](compendium/feats/eldritch-researcher-dedication-av2.md)

You can call in aberrations to fight for you or to answer questions. You can cast [summon entity](compendium/spells/summon-entity.md) as an innate occult spell once per day. If you couldn't already cast occult spells, these spells use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability, and you become trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells; if you could already cast occult spells, your proficiency in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells increases to expert.

As soon as the aberration arrives, instead of giving it any other commands, you can demand that it help you with a single question you pose to it. For the creature to effectively answer, you must [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) for 1 minute, and you must understand and be understood by the aberration. If you do, the aberration gives you a cryptic clue as provided by the [read omens](compendium/spells/read-omens.md) spell, except that the clue is even more enigmatic than normal; the creature then immediately returns from whence it came without providing you any other benefit. At 16th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the [summon entity](compendium/spells/summon-entity.md) spell is heightened by 1 level (to a maximum of 8th level when you reach 20th level).
