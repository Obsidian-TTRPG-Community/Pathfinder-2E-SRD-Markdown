# Beastmaster *Dedication Level 2*  

You attract the loyalty of animals, and as your powers increase you can command more of them, briefly inhabit their body to perceive what they perceive, and even communicate with them over vast distances. Your animals may see you as a beloved parent, teacher, and mentor, or they may consider you a poor, defenseless cub that needs protection. Regardless, they will fight for you and alongside you, even sacrificing their lives for you if necessary

> [!pf2-brown] BEASTMASTER ANIMAL COMPANIONS
> 
> If you're playing a beastmaster, you determine the statistics and abilities of your animal companions according to the rules on pages 214 –217 of the Core Rulebook. As a beastmaster, it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time—up to four companions—but only one of those companions, your "active companion," follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal companion from the Beastmaster archetype, you also gain Call Companion to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the beastmaster archetype or from another source.

collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature)

You gain the service of a young animal companion that travels with you and obeys your commands. The rules for animal companions appear on page 214 of the Core Rulebook, with additions on page 144 of this book. Contrary to the usual rules for animal companions, this feat can grant you a second animal companion. If you ever have more than one animal companion, you gain the Call Companion action. See the Beastmaster Animal Companions sidebar for details on this action.

Certain beastmaster feats give you primal focus spells. The rules for focus spells appear on page 300 of the Core Rulebook.

When you gain your first beastmaster focus spell, you become trained in primal spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma. Feats that grant beastmaster focus spells tell you to increase the number of Focus Points in your pool, but if you don't already have a focus pool, you instead get a focus pool with 1 Focus Point. You can [Refocus](rules/actions/refocus.md) by grooming, feeding, playing with, or otherwise tending to an animal companion.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the beastmaster archetype.

You quickly call in a primal projection of a non-active companion to provide the companion's support benefit. The projection arrives in an unoccupied square of your choice within 30 feet of you, grants you its support benefit, and then disappears on your next turn. The projection has the same AC and saving throw modifiers as the real companion, and if it would take any damage before your next turn, it disappears and the support benefit ends immediately.

- **Prerequisites**: [Mature Beastmaster Companion](compendium/feats/mature-beastmaster-companion-apg.md), you have multiple animal companions

You can have up to two animal companions active at once. However, when you do, it's slightly more difficult to Command them. If you don't Command either of your companions, one of the two (your choice) can still use 1 action on your turn to [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) or [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), as per Mature Beastmaster Companion, but not both. When you [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md), either choose one of the companions to take 2 actions, as normal, or else both companions can take 1 action to [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) or [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). Either way, you can't [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) to make either companion act again until your next turn.
