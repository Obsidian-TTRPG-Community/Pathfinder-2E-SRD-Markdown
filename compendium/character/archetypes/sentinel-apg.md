# Sentinel *Dedication Level 2*  

Armor offers solid, reassuring protection in combat, and as someone who faces danger on a regular basis, you have made it your business to get the most out of your defenses. You stand solid on any battlefield, encased in the sturdiest armor you can find. When danger threatens, your solid defenses will safely get you, and possibly your companions, home again. As a sentinel, you might be a member of an order of knights or bodyguards that trained you how best to take advantage of heavy armor. On the other hand, you might just be an adventurer who took one too many scrapes and decided that enough was enough, so you trained yourself to wear the heaviest plate you could get your hands on. Some witches or sorcerers have chosen to follow the path of the sentinel to increase their survivability.

```ad-embed-feat
title: Sentinel Dedication, Feat 2
collapse: closed
[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [dedication](rules/traits/dedication.md "Dedication Feat Trait")  


You have trained carefully to maximize the protective qualities of your armor. You become trained in light armor and medium armor. If you already were trained in light armor and medium armor, you gain training in heavy armor as well.

Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in any type of armor (but not unarmored defense), you also gain that proficiency in the armor types granted to you by this feat. If you are at least 13th level and you have a class feature that grants you expert proficiency in unarmored defense, you also become an expert in the armor types granted to you by this feat.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the sentinel archetype.

[archetype](rules/traits/archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sentinel Dedication](compendium/feats/sentinel-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** An adjacent foe critically fails an attack roll to [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) you with a melee weapon or unarmed attack.
- **Requirements**: You are wearing medium armor or heavier.
- **Activity** Reaction

You rebuff puny attacks with your armor, knocking back your foe. Attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) the triggering foe, even if you don't have a hand free. If you succeed, you can't [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) to follow the foe, as you're knocking the foe back with the rebounded attack, not by physically moving towards them.

- **Prerequisites**: [Sentinel Dedication](compendium/feats/sentinel-dedication-apg.md)

Thanks to your incredible connection to your armor, you can use it to shrug off an incredible array of dangers. Your bonus from the bulwark armor trait increases from +3 to +4, and it applies on all Reflex saves, not just damaging Reflex saves.

> [!pf2-note] This version of [Sacrifice Armor](compendium/feats/sacrifice-armor-apg.md) is intended for use with the Sentinel Archetype. Its level has been changed accordingly.

- **Trigger** You are hit by a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that deals physical damage.
- **Activity** Reaction

With divine awareness, you twist your body to lessen the impact of an attack. Reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to twice your armor's level. Your armor becomes [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken), reducing its Hit Points to its [Broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) Threshold. If your armor was already damaged, it is destroyed instead.

- **Prerequisites**: [Sacrifice Armor](compendium/feats/sacrifice-armor-apg.md)

Your divine grace empowers you to avoid hits when you otherwise could not. You can use Sacrifice Armor to reduce any type of damage from an attack or effect requiring a Reflex save.

When you use Sacrifice Armor against a critical hit or a critical failure on a Reflex save that would otherwise cause you to take double damage, you take the normal amount of damage instead.
