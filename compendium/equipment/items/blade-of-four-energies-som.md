# Blade Of Four Energies *Item 13+*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Held

This +2 greater striking shifting shortsword is formed of rapidly vibrating air and magical energy, though it uses the same statistics as iron. The wooden hilt is adorned with four gems, representing the energies of acid, cold, fire, and electricity, that sparkle in sequence at random intervals.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action")

You draw magical energy from one of the gems. Roll `1d4`.

Until the start of your next turn, the weapon gains the corresponding rune: 1—corrosive, 2—flaming, 3—frost, or 4—shock.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

- **Requirements**: The blade has an energy rune from the first activation

**Effect** You call upon the energy stored in the blade to explode outward. The blade of four energies casts a 5th-level spell that depends on the active rune: acid arrow for corrosive, fireball for flaming, cone of cold for frost, or lightning bolt for shock.
