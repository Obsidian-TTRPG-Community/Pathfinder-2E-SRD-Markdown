Each purloining cloak is a mercurial mantle once worn by a legendary thief or two. The cloak became infused with a daredevil spirit and a penchant for high-stakes thievery. If its owner isn't willing to partake in such activities, the cloak tries to convince them to sell or give it to someone who will. A purloining cloak can use tendrils of its cloth to attempt [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) checks to [Palm an Object](rules/actions/palm-an-object.md) or [Steal](rules/actions/steal.md), proudly offering you its loot later. In addition to those of a mercurial mantle, a purloining cloak has the following activations.

The cloak casts 2nd-level [illusory disguise](compendium/spells/illusory-disguise.md) on you, usually to your specifications. However the cloak can choose the appearance of the illusion for you.

The cloak assesses the price of valuables it can see. This valuation doesn't include the value of features the cloak can't discern, such as magical properties.
