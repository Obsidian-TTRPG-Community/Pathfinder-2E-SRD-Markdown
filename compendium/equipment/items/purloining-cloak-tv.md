- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn cloak

Each purloining cloak is a mercurial mantle once worn by a legendary thief or two. The cloak became infused with a daredevil spirit and a penchant for high-stakes thievery. If its owner isn't willing to partake in such activities, the cloak tries to convince them to sell or give it to someone who will. A purloining cloak can use tendrils of its cloth to attempt [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) checks to [Palm an Object](rules/actions/palm-an-object.md) or [Steal](rules/actions/steal.md), proudly offering you its loot later. In addition to those of a mercurial mantle, a purloining cloak has the following activations.

The cloak casts 2nd-level [illusory disguise](compendium/spells/illusory-disguise.md) on you, usually to your specifications. However the cloak can choose the appearance of the illusion for you.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") command


The cloak assesses the price of valuables it can see. This valuation doesn't include the value of features the cloak can't discern, such as magical properties.
