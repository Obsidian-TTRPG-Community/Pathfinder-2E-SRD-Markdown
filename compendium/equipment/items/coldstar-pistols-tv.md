- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

One dueling pistol in this paired set is etched with flames along its barrel, while the other is etched with icicles. In these separate forms, one gun comprising the Coldstar Pistols functions as a +3 greater striking greater flaming dueling pistol and the other as a +3 greater striking greater frost dueling pistol. When joined, the guns form a double-barreled weapon that functions as a +4 major striking greater flaming greater frost dueling pistol. The combined form has a range increment of 120 feet. In either form, the Coldstar Pistols have the agile, concealable, concussive, and fatal d10 traits. As star guns, the Coldstar Pistols run on magic and don't use ammunition or black powder.
