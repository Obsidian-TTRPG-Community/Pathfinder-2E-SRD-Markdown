Folklore from near the Forest of Spirits tells of the origin of the poracha fulu. Once, a traveler saved an eight‑legged feline who turned out to be a poracha prince. In return, the prince gave the traveler a fulu that later prevented a fast‑acting poison from slaying them. Traditionally, one wears a string of up to nine poracha fulus, which counts as one talisman. Each time you take [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), one poracha fulu affixed to you negates the damage and crumbles to dust. This response is automatic, but you can use a free action (envision) to prevent your fulus from responding. If you do, any poracha fulus affixed to you never respond to that [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
