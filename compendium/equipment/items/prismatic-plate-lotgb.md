With its standard-grade mithral polished to a mirrorlike sheen, this +2 resilient glamered mithral breastplate features the religious symbols of the goddesses of the Prismatic Ray pantheon—[Desna](compendium/setting/deities/desna.md), [Sarenrae](compendium/setting/deities/sarenrae.md), and [Shelyn](compendium/setting/deities/shelyn.md)—surrounded by a rainbow-colored set of gems.

You surround yourself in a coruscating field of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet light for 1 minute. Each color has a different effect, based on the effects of a 7th-level [chromatic wall](compendium/spells/chromatic-wall.md) spell, and you apply the effects of each color once before it disappears from your field of light, which can happen in the following two ways.

First, the field attempts a counteract check (counteract level 7, counteract modifier +27) against [any](rules/traits/any-b1.md "Any Alignment Trait") effect that would be blocked by a chromatic wall of any of the colors still surrounding you in your field of light. Succeed or fail, that color then disappears from your field of light.

Second, any creature that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon is affected by a random remaining color from your field. As normal, this doesn't affect creatures you choose to touch.

A creature can also remove a color from your field of light by using a specific spell, as described in chromatic wall. The effect ends early if each color disappears from your field of light, or if you choose to [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) it.
