# Communication Bangle *Item 1*  
[uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 10 gp
- **Usage** worn

This simple brass ring is meant to be worn as an ornamentation piece to an outfit, oftentimes as a bangle on the wrist, as the ring closure of a scarf or sash, or as an ornamentation piece of a headdress. While decorative, this serves a cover for the bangle's function as a message bearer. Messages can be coded into the bangle, either through a series of raised dots and dashes or a pattern of notches of different depths and spacings. A bangle is large enough to hold a simple message consisting of a few words like "Danger. Flee." or "Meeting. Sunset. Fountain." Coding a message into a bangle requires 1 minute of time. All Pathfinders with access to communication bangles are taught how to code and read most basic messages, but anyone with a bangle can develop their own communication system.

A creature inspecting a bangle can discover its true purpose by succeeding at a DC 20 [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check. Deciphering a message requires a creature to succeed at a [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) check against the coder's [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) DC.
