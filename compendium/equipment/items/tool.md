# Tool *Item 0*  

- **Category** Adventuring Gear

This entry is a catchall for basic hand tools that don't have a specific adventuring purpose. A hoe, shovel, or sledgehammer is a long tool, and a hand drill, ice hook, or trowel is a short tool. A tool can usually be used as an improvised weapon, dealing `1d4` damage for a short tool or `1d6` for a long tool. The GM determines the damage type that's appropriate or adjusts the damage if needed.
