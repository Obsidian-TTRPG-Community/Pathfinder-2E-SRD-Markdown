# Shield Sconce *Item 0*  
[uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 1 sp

This carefully balanced metal bracket can be attached to the front or top of a shield or [tower shield](compendium/equipment/items/tower-shield.md) (but not a [buckler](compendium/equipment/items/buckler.md)), allowing you to carry a [torch](compendium/equipment/items/torch.md) without giving up your shield or holding it in your other hand. While carrying a [torch](compendium/equipment/items/torch.md) in this way, you must attempt a DC 11 flat check every time you use the [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) reaction; on a failure, the [torch](compendium/equipment/items/torch.md) is extinguished.
