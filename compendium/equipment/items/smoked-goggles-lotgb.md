# Smoked Goggles *Item 3*  

- **Price** 20 gp
- **Usage** worn eyepiece

These goggles use lenses made out of smoked glass to protect against creatures with gaze attacks. While wearing smoked goggles, you're always considered to be [Averting your Gaze](rules/actions/avert-gaze.md), but all creatures have [concealment](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) from you. The fact that the goggles conceal creatures is part of what grants the wearer the item's benefits. If you have a way to negate the [concealment](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) from the smoked goggles, you no longer gain the benefit, either.
