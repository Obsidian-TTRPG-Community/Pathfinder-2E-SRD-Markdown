Used to facilitate the care of mounts during long campaigns or when it's necessary to move camp frequently, this object appears to be a simple, worn wooden horseshoe.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [⏲](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency") 1 minute command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You place the horseshoe on the ground and it unfolds into a spacious stable with a wide central aisle, stalls to accommodate up to eight horses, and sufficient feed and water to sustain the horses for 1 day.

The stalls can house other quadrupedal mounts, but the stable provides only horse feed, which might be unsuitable for other creatures. As a 1-minute activity, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait, you can alter the shape of the stalls to accommodate different mounts, though the space available within the stable never changes, only the layout.

A metal horseshoe hangs inside the stable near the entrance. You can remove the horseshoe with an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action, which causes the stable to fold into the horseshoe, leaving it again looking as if it's made of worn wood.
