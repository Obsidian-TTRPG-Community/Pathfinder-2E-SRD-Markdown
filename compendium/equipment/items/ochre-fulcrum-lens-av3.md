This brownish-orange lens always seems dusty and gritty, even when wet. While you have the Ochre Fulcrum Lens invested, lassitude grips you. You gain resistance 10 to mental damage and a +2 status bonus to saves against [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effects. You can also activate the lens in the following ways.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You hold up the Ochre Fulcrum Lens in your hand and the item casts crushing despair (DC 31 Will save).
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) ([attack](rules/traits/attack.md), [possession](rules/traits/possession.md))
