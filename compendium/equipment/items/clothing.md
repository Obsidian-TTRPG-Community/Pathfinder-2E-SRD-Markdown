### Variants

#### ordinary *Item 0*

- **Price**: 1 sp

Ordinary clothing is functional with basic tailoring, such as peasant garb, monk's robes, or work clothes.

#### explorer's *Item 0*

- **Price**: 1 sp

Explorer's clothing is sturdy enough that it can be reinforced to protect you, even though it isn't a suit of armor. It comes in many forms, though the most common sorts look like clerical vestments, monk's garments, or wizard's robes, as members of all three classes are likely to avoid wearing armor.

#### fine *Item 0*

You gain a +1 item bonus to checks to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on upper-class folk while wearing high-fashion fine clothing.
