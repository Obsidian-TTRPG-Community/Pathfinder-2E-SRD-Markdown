# Judgment Thurible *Item 10+*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [spellheart](rules/traits/spellheart-som.md "Spellheart Equipment Trait")  

- **Bulk** —; **Usage** affixed to armor or a weapon

The golden religious symbol on the top of this spherical incense holder shifts its form to match the faith of its bearer. You gain no benefit from a judgment thurible if you don't worship a deity or if your deity is true neutral. The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 27.

- Armor After you cast a spell by activating the thurible, the thurible casts circle of protection on you, with a duration of 1 round. You choose the alignment, which must be one opposed by one of your deity's alignments.
- Weapon After you cast a spell by activating the thurible, the weapon gains your choice of an anarchic, axiomatic, holy, or unholy rune until the end of your next turn. You can choose a rune only if it matches an alignment your deity has (anarchic for chaotic, axiomatic for lawful, holy for good, or unholy for evil).
