# Toy Carriage *Item 0+*  


A miniature toy carriage is carved from wood and has fully functioning wheels. It can vary in size from 2 to 8 inches long, too small for even Tiny creatures to ride. If pushed or propelled, obstacles and terrain might slow, stop, tip, or divert the carriage's course.

### Variants

#### toy carriage *Item 0*

- **Price**: 5 sp

If pushed and released as an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action, a toy carriage rolls along the ground up to 20 feet.

#### windup toy carriage *Item 2*

- **Price**: 5 gp

A tiny crank protrudes from the side of this carriage. If the crank is wound and the carriage is released on the ground, the carriage propels in a straight line at a Speed of 10 feet.

Each [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action spent winding the crank propels the carriage for 1 round. A windup toy carriage can be wound for a maximum of 9 actions total, at which point it's too tight to wind further.
