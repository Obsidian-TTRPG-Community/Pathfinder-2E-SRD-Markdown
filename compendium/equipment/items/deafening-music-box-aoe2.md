[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")

Symbols of musical notes decorate this gold-framed wooden cube measuring just under 1 foot by 1 foot. A funnel-shaped trumpet protrudes from the box's top at an angle, though it feels surprisingly light. The box has a large button on its side, and it must be set down on a flat surface in order to activate it; while it's activated, the rumbling and churning gears inside the box make it impossible to carry without dropping it.

title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You press the button on the side of the music box, causing it to erupt with a cacophonous and discordant melody for 1 minute while it plays its entire melody, and it can't be shut off prematurely.

The music is so loud that any creature within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or become [deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for as long as they remain within 60 feet of the music box, and for 1 minute thereafter. On a critical success, a creature need not make any more saves and is temporarily immune to the deafening music box for the next 24 hours; on a success, the creature must attempt a new save each round it remains within 60 feet of the music box.
