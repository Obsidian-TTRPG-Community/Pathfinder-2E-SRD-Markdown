# Iron Cudgel *Item 14*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 900 gp
- **Bulk** —; **Usage** affixed to a weapon
- **Activate** [Brutal Finish](compendium/feats/brutal-finish.md)

You are a master with the affixed weapon.

This miniature iron cudgel is typically affixed to a weapon by an iron chain. When you activate the cudgel, you use Brutal Finish, as the fighter feat (page 151). You must meet the normal requirements, including those of the [press](rules/traits/press.md "Press Combat Trait") trait.

If you have the Brutal Finish feat, add two additional weapon damage dice on a success or a failure.
