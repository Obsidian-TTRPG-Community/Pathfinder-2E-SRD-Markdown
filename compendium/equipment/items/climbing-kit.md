# Climbing Kit *Item 0*  

- **Price** 5 sp
- **Bulk** 1
- **Hands** 2

This satchel includes 50 feet of rope, pulleys, a dozen pitons, a hammer, a grappling hook, and one set of crampons. Climbing kits allow you to attach yourself to the wall you're [Climbing](rules/actions/climb.md), moving half as quickly as usual (minimum 5 feet) but letting you attempt a DC 5 flat check whenever you critically fail to prevent a fall. A single kit has only enough materials for one climber; each climber needs their own kit. If you wear your climbing kit, you can access it as part of a [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md) action.
