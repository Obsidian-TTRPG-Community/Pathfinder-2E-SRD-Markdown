# Pilferer's Gloves *Item 17*  
[apex](rules/traits/apex.md "Apex Item Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 15000 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn gloves

Made of soft and subtle black leather, these gloves fit tightly but aren't uncomfortable and don't impede your sense of touch. As long as you're trained in [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) while wearing these gloves, you're always considered one skill rank higher than your actual rank. If you possess a Legendary skill rank in [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery), you gain a +2 item bonus to [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) checks instead. When you invest the gloves, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.

- **Trigger**: You fail or critically fail a [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) skill check

**Effect** If you failed the [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) skill check, you succeed at that check instead. If you critically failed, you fail instead.
