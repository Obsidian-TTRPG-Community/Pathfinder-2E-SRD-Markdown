# Sense-Dulling Hood *Item 6+*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 2 hands
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

Sometimes, an enemy's dangerous special ability makes relatively standard sensory capabilities a liability. From otyugh stench to a harpy's song, plenty of creatures use their prey's senses against them. A sense-dulling hood is a wide, single-use mask designed to be pulled from an airtight package and slipped over the head. The mask grants you an item bonus to saving throws against auditory, [olfactory](rules/traits/olfactory-b1.md "Olfactory Effect Trait"), and [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") effects for a time, according to the mask's type. Since it dulls your senses without depriving you of them, the mask also imposes a –1 penalty to rolls and checks using [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) for the same duration.
