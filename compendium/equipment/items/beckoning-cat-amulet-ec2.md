- **Price** 26 gp
- **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You use a feat or ability to reroll a failed or critically failed Reflex saving throw (such as [Cat's Luck](compendium/feats/cats-luck-apg.md) or [Halfling Luck](compendium/feats/halfling-luck.md))
- **Category** Talisman

This clay figurine resembles a white cat with a paw outstretched. When it's activated, any allies within 10 feet who also just failed or critically failed a Reflex saving throw from the same source (such as a [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md) spell) can also reroll their saving throw and use the better result.
