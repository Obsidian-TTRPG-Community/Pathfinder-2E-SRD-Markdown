# Bellicose Dagger *Item 7*  
[cursed](rules/traits/cursed-gmg.md "Cursed Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

The hilt of a bellicose dagger is etched with the word for "war" in various languages. Having absorbed the spirit of violence over the course of its existence, the weapon now craves bloodshed. A bellicose dagger is a +1 striking wounding dagger. However, anytime you interact with creatures, no matter the context, you must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or else find you have, as a reaction, drawn the dagger. When you use the bellicose dagger as a weapon for the first time, it fuses to you. While it's in your possession, you take a –2 circumstance penalty to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks and skill checks to avoid fighting, such as [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks to trick your way out of a scuffle or [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks to sneak past enemies.
