This +1 striking arquebusG&G is used by caravan guards to nonlethally—though powerfully—deter large game and bandits. When fired, the spark gun deals mental damage and adds the [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait") trait to the attack. Each mindlance also includes a reinforced stock that benefits from any fundamental runes on the firearm. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with a mindlance, the target becomes [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) unless it succeeds at a DC 24 Will save.
