# Dinosaur Boots *Item 10+*  
[invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** worn

The tough, scaled leather of these heavy boots comes from a mighty dinosaur, granting you the steadiness of a lumbering beast. Any time an action or effect would cause you to make a forced movement, roll a DC 17 flat check. On a success, the forced movement fails to affect you.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") command ([magical](rules/traits/magical.md), [morph](rules/traits/morph.md), [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md))

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You grow, gaining the effects of enlarge for 1 minute. During that time, you gain dinosaur features; your legs and feet transform into a dinosaur's.

You gain a foot unarmed attack that has the same statistics as your fist unarmed attack, except its damage die is increased from `1d4` to `1d6`. Once during the duration, you can use the Trample 3-action activity (Bestiary 344) to Trample creatures one size smaller than you or smaller. This deals an amount of damage to each creature equal to that of your foot unarmed attack (including any extra weapon damage dice, bonuses, or additional damage as normal), with a DC 27 basic Reflex save. You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the activation.

### Variants

#### dinosaur boots *Item 10*

- **Price**: 950 gp

#### greater dinosaur boots *Item 16*

- **Price**: 9500 gp

The activation makes you grow to size [Huge](rules/traits/huge-b1.md "Huge Size Trait"), if you choose, with the effects of 4th-level [enlarge](compendium/spells/enlarge.md). Either way, the damage die of your foot unarmed attack increases from `1d4` to `1d8`, and you can use Trample as many times as you want during the activation.
