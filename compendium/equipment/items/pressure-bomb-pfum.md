This tightly sealed metal container is filled with highly pressurized gas that can explode to release a powerful shockwave. A pressure bomb deals the listed bludgeoning damage and splash damage. On a critical hit, the target is knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone). Many types grant an item bonus to attack rolls, and more powerful pressure bombs can knock creatures back.
