# Dragontooth Club *Item 12*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 1800 gp
- **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include teeth from a dragon with a breath weapon that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage.
- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** held in 1 hand

Dragon teeth line the edges of this +2 greater striking [leiomano](compendium/equipment/items/leiomano-tv.md). The leiomano also has a flaming, frost, shock, or corrosive rune, as appropriate for the dragon from which the teeth were taken, which also grants the weapon the associated [energy](rules/traits/energy-loag.md "Energy Energy & Element Trait") trait (for instance, fire for a club made with teeth taken from a red dragon).

title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) ([evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md), [magical](rules/traits/magical.md))

- **Frequency**: once per minute

**Effect** You swing the leiomano, sending several of the dragon teeth shooting through the air on jets of energy. The dragon teeth deal `3d6` piercing damage and `3d6` damage of the energy type corresponding to the weapon in a 15-foot cone (DC 29 basic Reflex save). The teeth hunt down their targets, correcting their flight in midair, which reduces any circumstance bonus from cover by 2.
