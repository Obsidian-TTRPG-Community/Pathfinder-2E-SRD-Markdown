Dragon teeth line the edges of this +2 greater striking leiomano (page 25). The leiomano also has a flaming, frost, shock, or corrosive rune, as appropriate for the dragon from which the teeth were taken, which also grants the weapon the associated [energy](rules/traits/energy-loag.md "Energy Energy & Element Trait") trait (for instance, fire for a club made with teeth taken from a red dragon).

You swing the leiomano, sending several of the dragon teeth shooting through the air on jets of energy. The dragon teeth deal `3d6` piercing damage and `3d6` damage of the energy type corresponding to the weapon in a 15-foot cone (DC 29 basic Reflex save). The teeth hunt down their targets, correcting their flight in midair, which reduces any circumstance bonus from cover by 2.
