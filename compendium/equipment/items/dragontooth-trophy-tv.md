# Dragontooth Trophy *Item 14*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 800 gp
- **Craft Requirements** Supply one tooth from an adult or older dragon.
- **Bulk** —; **Usage** affixed to a weapon
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You succeed at a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the affixed weapon.

This imposing fang is engraved with an intricate arrangement of symbols, glyphs, and patterns and dangles from a leather strap bound to the hilt of the affixed weapon. When you Activate the trophy your weapon is momentarily transformed into a magical construct of draconic fury. On the triggering [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) and until the end of your next turn, the damage type of the affixed weapon changes to the type matching the dragon the claw came from (see the sidebar). This change overrides the [versatile](rules/traits/versatile.md "Versatile Weapon Trait") trait and similar abilities.
