# Resonating Fork *Item 5+*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait")  [spellheart](rules/traits/spellheart-som.md "Spellheart Equipment Trait")  

- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to armor or a weapon

This two-pronged fork of metal emits a constant low hum, vibrating slightly when touched. The spell attack roll of any spell cast by activating this item is +9, and the spell DC is 19.

- Armor You gain resistance 2 to sonic damage and a +1 item bonus to saving throws against effects with the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") or [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait") trait.
- Weapon After you cast a sonic spell by activating the fork, the weapon reverberates with trapped sound waves. Your next [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) causes the target to be [deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 round if it hits (or for 3 rounds on a critical hit). If you don't make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) by the end of your next turn, the sound waves dissipate with no effect.
