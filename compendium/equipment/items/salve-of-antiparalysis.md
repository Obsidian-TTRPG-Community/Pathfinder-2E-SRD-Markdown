- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

Applying this filmy salve to a creature helps it overcome magical paralysis. The creature recovers as if it were the target of a 3rd-level [remove paralysis](compendium/spells/remove-paralysis.md) spell.

### Variants

#### salve of antiparalysis *Item 6*

- **Price**: 40 gp

#### greater salve of antiparalysis *Item 12*

- **Price**: 325 gp

A greater salve of antiparalysis can potentially remove [petrification](rules/conditions.md#Petrified).
