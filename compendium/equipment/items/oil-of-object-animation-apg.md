This fine golden oil comes in a small blue canister. Carefully spreading the oil over an object turns it into an animated object (Bestiary 20) of the same type. For example, sprinkling it on a statue makes an animated statue. If the animated object's level would be greater than 3, the oil struggles to animate it and ultimately fails.

This animated object has the [minion](rules/traits/minion.md) trait, meaning it can use 2 actions when you Command it. You can issue a Command for the current turn as part of the activation. The object remains animated for 1 minute before falling inert. As usual, you can have a maximum of four minions under your control.
