A singing sword is a longsword imbued with the consciousness of a boisterous bard, and therefore constantly sings at all times. A singing sword can't stop singing and in fact communicates in no way other than by singing. A successful [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) or [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check against its Will DC can convince it to quiet its singing to a whisper for 10 minutes, or 20 minutes on a critical success, though it quickly grows displeased at anyone who attempts this repeatedly.

The singing sword can spend its actions to attack on its own, with the effects of a [dancing](compendium/equipment/items/dancing.md) weapon's activation, except that its attack modifier is ++12. Additionally, it can perform the following activations; each casts a composition spell and follows all the usual rules for compositions.
