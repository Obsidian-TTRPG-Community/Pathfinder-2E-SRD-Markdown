- **Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.

In its normal form, a spy staff is a slim rod of burnished wood with subtle etchings of eyes upon its sides. The first to develop the spy staff were agents of Andoran's Twilight Talons, but such staves have spread to espionage agencies throughout the Inner Sea region and beyond.
