# Buzzsaw Axe *Item 11+*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

With an aerodynamic cutting edge and a curved handle, this +2 striking battle axe is perfectly suited to whirling motions, and in fact seems like it wants to whirl free from your grip. A [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with this axe that benefits from the [sweep](rules/traits/sweep.md "Sweep Weapon Trait") trait's circumstance bonus on attack rolls also gains a +2 circumstance bonus to the damage roll.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** You hurl the axe, which spins at great speed as it flies to a distant point and returns to you, leaving a trail of carnage. Each creature in a 120-foot line must succeed at a DC 28 basic Reflex save or take damage equal to the weapon's melee damage, including your Strength modifier.
