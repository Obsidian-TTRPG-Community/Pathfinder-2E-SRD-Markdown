[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Price** 3000 gp
- **Usage** etched onto armor

Counter-runes specific to a particular school of magic provide protections against that school. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws and AC against one school of magic: abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, or transmutation. The crafter chooses the school when creating the rune.
