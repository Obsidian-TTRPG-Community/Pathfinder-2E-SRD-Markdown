This steel shield (Hardness 16, HP 96, BT 48) is painted a mottled crimson, and it always glistens as if wet. Its crest is composed of eight appendages that curl around each other, resembling the swirling tentacles of a giant kraken. Two ferocious eyes sit in its center, gleaming with an inner light.

You unleash the kraken's wrath. You Raise the Shield. The shield's appendages briefly extend to impossible length as they wriggle and lash out at your foes, dealing `10d10` bludgeoning damage to all enemies in a 30-foot cone (DC 41 basic Reflex save). The shield remains animated for 1 minute, during which you can use it to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) a creature within 10 feet of you without needing a free hand. When you use the shield to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), you gain a +3 item bonus to your [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check.

Kraken's Ink Wares.
