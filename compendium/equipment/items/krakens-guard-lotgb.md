[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 40000 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in one hand

This steel shield (Hardness 16, HP 96, BT 48) is painted a mottled crimson, and it always glistens as if wet. Its crest is composed of eight appendages that curl around each other, resembling the swirling tentacles of a giant kraken. Two ferocious eyes sit in its center, gleaming with an inner light.

title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") Raise a Shield

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** You unleash the kraken's wrath. You Raise the Shield. The shield's appendages briefly extend to impossible length as they wriggle and lash out at your foes, dealing `10d10` bludgeoning damage to all enemies in a 30-foot cone (DC 41 basic Reflex save). The shield remains animated for 1 minute, during which you can use it to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) a creature within 10 feet of you without needing a free hand. When you use the shield to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), you gain a +3 item bonus to your [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check.

Kraken's Ink Wares.
