# Druid's Crown *Item 6*

Made of materials scavenged from wild places, a druid's crown can be rebuilt for a variety of benefits. The crown grants you a +1 item bonus to a skill, and can be activated to cast a spell, both depending on the material used to build the crown, as listed on the table below. If you invest and wear [druid's vestments](compendium/equipment/items/druids-vestments.md) along with the crown, the crown's item bonus increases by 1 and its spell's DC rises to 27. You can invest this item only if you're a druid. When you do, as a 10-minute activity that has the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait, you can disassemble and rebuild the crown with different materials, changing its item bonus and spell accordingly.

The crown casts its spell at 2nd level (DC 20).
