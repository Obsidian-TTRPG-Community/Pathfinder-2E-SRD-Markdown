This +1 striking frost katana is always cool to the touch, nearly uncomfortably so. Unadorned and with no tsuba, its honed blade is carved from a single tusk of dragon-turtle ivory and wrapped in strips of winter wolf hide. [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) with the katana gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls against creatures that have a status penalty to their Speed or are [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed). The status bonus increases to +3 if the weapon has a greater striking rune and +4 for major striking.

- **Trigger**: Your spell deals cold damage to a creature
