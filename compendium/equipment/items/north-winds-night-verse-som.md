# North Wind's Night Verse *Item 10*  
[cold](rules/traits/cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 900 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This +1 striking frost katana is always cool to the touch, nearly uncomfortably so. Unadorned and with no tsuba, its honed blade is carved from a single tusk of dragon-turtle ivory and wrapped in strips of winter wolf hide. [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) with the katana gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls against creatures that have a status penalty to their Speed or are [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed). The status bonus increases to +3 if the weapon has a greater striking rune and +4 for major striking.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") command ([cold](rules/traits/cold.md), [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md), [magical](rules/traits/magical.md))

- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Trigger**: Your spell deals cold damage to a creature

**Effect** Choose one creature dealt cold damage by the spell. It takes a â€“5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
