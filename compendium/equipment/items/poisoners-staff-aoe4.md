[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [staff](rules/traits/staff.md "Staff Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This gnarled staff is covered with thorns and coated with a glistening lacquer that acts as a minor irritant.

While holding the staff, you aren't affected by its coating or thorns, and you reduce the DC of your flat checks to overcome [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)


You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
```
