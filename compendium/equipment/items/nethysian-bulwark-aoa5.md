This round shield is often fashioned to resemble the religious symbol of its dual-natured namesake. A _Nethysian bulwark_ is a high-grade cold iron shield (Hardness 10, HP 40, BT 20) that defends the wielder and can explode with retributive force when struck.

- **Trigger**: The shield becomes [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) when performing a [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md)

**Effect** The shield explodes in a burst of bright light and shadowy tendrils, releasing a 15-foot cone of force that must include the attacker if possible. The cone deals `6d8` force damage to all creatures in the area (DC 34 basic Reflex save).
