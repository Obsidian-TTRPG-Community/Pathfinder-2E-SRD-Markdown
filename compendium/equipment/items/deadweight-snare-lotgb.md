This snare is made of magnetized weights and heavy ropes rigged to a trip wire or pressure plate. When a creature enters the square, the magnets and ropes deploy, weighing down the creature's weapons and limbs. The creature must attempt a DC 18 Reflex save.

> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature drops any metallic items it's holding.
