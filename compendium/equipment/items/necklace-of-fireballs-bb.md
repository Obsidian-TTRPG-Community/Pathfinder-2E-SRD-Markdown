# Necklace of Fireballs *Item 5*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 44 gp
- **Usage** worn

This hemp string has several lustrous, red beads of various sizes hanging from it. When activated, it briefly appears in its true form: a golden chain with golden spheres attached by fine threads. There's one large sphere and two smaller ones. You can use the beads one at a time to create magical fireballs. When all the beads are gone, the necklace becomes a non-magical hemp string.

title: **Pluck a Sphere** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") ([manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md))


You detach a sphere from the necklace, causing it to glow with orange light. If you or anyone else hurls it (an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action with the ranged trait), it detonates where it lands in a 20-foot burst. A large sphere deals `6d6` fire damage, and a small one deals `4d6` fire damage. Any creature in the area must attempt a DC 21 basic Reflex save. Your toss can place the center of the fireball anywhere within 70 feet. If no one hurls the sphere by the start of your next turn, it turns into a non-magical red bead.
