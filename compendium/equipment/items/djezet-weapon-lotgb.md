# Djezet Weapon *Item 12+*  
[rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** varies by weapon; **Bulk** varies by weapon
- **Category** Material

The djezet in weapons absorbs magical power. Critical hits made with a djezet weapon against a prepared or spontaneous spellcaster cause the target to lose one prepared spell or one spontaneous spell slot unless the target succeeds at a Will save (DC 30 for standard-grade or DC 40 for high-grade). The spell is randomly selected from among the caster's highest three spell levels (and then from among the spells prepared in that level, for a prepared spellcaster).
