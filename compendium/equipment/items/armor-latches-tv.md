# Armor Latches *Item 1*  
[adjustment](rules/traits/adjustment-lotgb.md)  

- **Price** 4 gp
- **Usage** applied to armor; **Bulk** â€”
- **Category** Adjustment

This armor is easily doffed. A set of armor with armor latches gains the [noisy](rules/traits/noisy.md) trait; you can't add latches to armor that already possesses the [noisy](rules/traits/noisy.md) trait. You can remove a set of armor with armor latches with a 3-action activity, which has the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait. This doesn't affect the time it takes to don the armor.
