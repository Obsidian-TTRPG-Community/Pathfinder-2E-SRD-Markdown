# Potion Of Stable Form *Item 10+*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [potion](rules/traits/potion.md "Potion Item Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

This aromatic potion is brewed from the white flowers and black roots of the magical herb moly. When you drink this potion, it immediately attempts to counteract all [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait") effects affecting you. For the next hour, you gain an item bonus against [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait") effects, which is greater against [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait") effects. If you roll a success against a [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait") effect during that time, you get a critical success instead.
