# Wand Of Thundering Echoes *Item 9+*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  [wand](rules/traits/wand.md "Wand Item Trait")  

- **Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of sound burst of the appropriate level. In every port where he finds himself, Rakuskuk (N male tengu rune crafter) rents a rather simple stall he then decorates to look like a ship's cabin. He displays his wares in or on large trunks and barrels so he can easily pack up and move everything at the end of the day... or in a hurry. The largest two trunks stand open vertically to reveal hanging clothing and accessories he thinks wealthy travelers will buy, always including at least one cloak, cape, duster, and scarf. He hangs a ship's hammock between them for aesthetics, but it doubles as an elevated surface for hanging trinkets and jewelry. Another trunk contains what must be the largest collection of hats outside of a royal haberdashery. He calls this makeshift shop the Rune Room, as every item he sells is either an accessory rune (page 88) or has one on it.
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

A forked, lightning-like crack runs down the length of this ornate stone wand, which rumbles slightly with the peals of distant thunder.
