# Wheel Spikes *Item 0*  

- **Price** 5 sp
- **Category** Wheelchair Upgrade

A set of thick, sharp spikes have been added to the chair's wheels, granting you a piercing attack. While in the chair, you gain a wheel spike [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). Your wheel spike deals `1d4` piercing damage and has the agile, [attached](rules/traits/attached.md "Attached Weapon Trait"), and [free-hand](rules/traits/free-hand.md "Free-Hand Weapon Trait") traits. A wheel spike is a simple melee weapon in the knife weapon group. You can etch weapon runes onto wheel spikes.

A wheelchair can only have one attached weapon.
