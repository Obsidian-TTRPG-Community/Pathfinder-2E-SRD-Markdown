This loose robe has wide, voluminous sleeves that each contain an extradimensional space. These spaces each function as a bag of holding that can hold up to 5 Bulk of items (for a total of 10 Bulk), though no individual item can be of more than 1 Bulk; the sleeves grow slightly heavy as you reach maximum capacity. You can add or remove an item from a sleeve with a single hand free as an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action.

If a sleeve is completely empty, you can place your own familiar into that extradimensional space. It can survive comfortably in your sleeve for up to 1 hour, after which it begins to suffocate. While in your sleeve, it can't be affected or targeted by [any](rules/traits/any-b1.md) effects, but you don't benefit from any master abilities. A familiar can exit the sleeve of its own volition with a single action that has the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md) and [move](rules/traits/move.md) traits. You can't place any other creature into your sleeves, nor can you place your familiar in a sleeve if it's larger than Tiny. If your familiar is in your sleeve, you can't place any items in the sleeve.
