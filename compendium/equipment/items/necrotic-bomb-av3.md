Necrotic bombs combine reagents most people consider disgusting at best and unholy at worst, creating a life-sucking miasma upon contact with air. A necrotic bomb deals the listed negative damage and [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage, and it sickens the primary target on a critical hit. This damage harms only living creatures.

Many types grant an item bonus to attack rolls.
