Invented by Belkzen's zealous Steel-Eaters, the butchering axe has an oversized head and a long, thick haft counterbalanced with steel or stone. The weapon's sweeping strokes inflict immense damage, particularly against groups of foes, and can push dangerous opponents away to a safe distance. All of these qualities are particularly useful against the lumbering zombie hordes of the Whispering Tyrant. Correspondingly, butchering axes are often wielded by orc and half-orc Crimson Reclaimers of Lastwall.
