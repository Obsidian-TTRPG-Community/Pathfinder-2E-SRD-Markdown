# Swarming *Item 9*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 700 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a thrown weapon

Able to copy itself many times over when thrown until the air is filled with deadly blades, a swarming weapon turns a single weapon into a shower of devastation.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, envision

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** You fling your weapon and it multiplies as it flies through the air, filling a 30-foot cone. All creatures within the area take damage equal to double the weapon's number of damage dice, with a DC 27 basic Reflex save.
```
