# Warding Escutcheon *Item 9+*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Bulk** 4; **Usage** held in 1 hand

An image of a keyhole adorns the coat of arms of this stone tower shield (Hardness 10, HP 40, BT 20).

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** The shield becomes a locked door in an empty, adjacent space no wider than 5 feet, becoming flush with the surrounding structure so it blocks all passage. The door has the same Hardness, HP, and [Broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) Threshold as the shield, with [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) and [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DCs of 25 to open. The door remains in place for 1 hour, until it's opened or [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken), or until you spend an action to end this effect, at which point the shield returns to your hand (or falls to the ground in your space if your hands are full).
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [⏲](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency") 1 minute command

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** The shield floats lazily in the air as bricks quickly fly from it to form a squat stone tower around it. You cast [cozy cabin](compendium/spells/cozy-cabin-apg.md), with the shield becoming the door.
