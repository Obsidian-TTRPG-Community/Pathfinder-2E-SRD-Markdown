These immense bows are traditionally made from the horns of great beasts, though modern residents of Hongal, the northernmost nation in Tian Xia, often use composite materials or even small trees as the weapon's base. While Hongali hornbows have a shorter range than other bows, they make up for it by focusing the power of the longbow at a short distance and can be used from horsebackâ€”perfect for the skirmishing fighting style of mounted Hongali troops. While it's difficult for those in Avistan to get their hands on these Hongali weapons, a small warband of beast-riding orcs from the Hold of Belkzen managed to arm themselves with Hongali hornbows and cut a bloody swathe through adventurers and neighboring militaries alike for several years before they were finally defeated via a desperate ambush. The stories of that warband spread, causing Avistani adventurers with little knowledge of Tian Xia to associate the bows with orcs. Hongali characters have access to the Hongali hornbow.
