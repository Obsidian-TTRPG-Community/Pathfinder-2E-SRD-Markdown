The shobhad longrifle is a firearm with a long, rifled barrel. Often mounted with a multi-lensed scope for targeting at an array of ranges and a chambering mechanism that can adjust the speed and penetrating power of each shot, it's the preferred weapon of many shobhad warriors. Shobhad longrifles are equipped with a built-in [silencer](compendium/equipment/items/silencer-g-g.md) so they make no more noise than a crossbow when fired.

For more information on firearms, see Pathfinder Guns & Gears. If you don't wish to include firearms in your Strength of Thousands campaign, simply substitute the longrifles wielded by shobhads in this adventure with [composite longbows](compendium/equipment/items/composite-longbow.md).
