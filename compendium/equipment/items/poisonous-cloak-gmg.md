This innocuous-looking cloak is associated with a type of poison, set at the cloak's creation. It often appears as a clandestine cloak or a cloak of the bat to the unaware. When you invest this cloak, you lose any resistance to poison damage, and anytime you take piercing or slashing damage in combat, you are exposed to the type of poison associated with the poisonous cloak with no onset, even if it's not an injury poison. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the cloak fuses to you.
