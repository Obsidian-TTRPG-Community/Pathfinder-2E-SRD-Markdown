# Grim Sandglass *Item 3+*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [spellheart](rules/traits/spellheart-som.md)  

- **Usage** affixed to armor or a weapon
- **Category** Spellheart

One bulb of this tiny hourglass contains black sand, the other white. After even a few grains pass from one side to the other, it reverses its flow to keep the two sides in equilibrium. The spell DC of any spell cast by [Activating](rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) this item is 17.

- **Armor** You gain resistance 2 to negative.
- **Weapon** After you cast a necromancy spell by [Activating](rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) the sandglass, your [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) with the weapon deal an additional `1d4` negative damage until the end of your next turn.
