Performers popularized these bundles of aromatic herbs to calm the mind and ward off misfortune before a big show, though soldier bards have found them especially useful for clearing fear during particularly tumultuous battles. Adding this catalyst to a [soothe](compendium/spells/soothe.md) spell also causes the spell to reduce the target's [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition value by 1.
