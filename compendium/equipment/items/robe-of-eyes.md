# Robe of Eyes *Item 17*  
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 13000 gp
- **Usage** worn garment; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Worn

This garment appears to be an ordinary robe until donned, at which point numerous strange and alien eyes of varied shapes and colors open and blink across its fabric. While wearing the robe, you gain a +3 item bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks, and you constantly benefit from the effects of a 2nd-level [see invisibility](compendium/spells/see-invisibility.md) spell.

You can also see powerful magic auras. The highest-level [magic aura](compendium/spells/magic-aura.md) within 30 feet of you glows in a color that reveals its school to you and allows you to determine where the effect originates. This can narrow down the origin point of the effect to a 5-foot-cube, but not more precisely than that.

The robe of eyes is not without its dangers. If any spell with the [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait") trait is cast on you or your square while you are wearing the robe, you are [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level unless you succeed at a Fortitude save against the spell's DC.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You pluck an eye from the robe and toss it into the air, where it turns [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) and floats to a destination you choose, with the same effect as a 5th-level [prying eye](compendium/spells/prying-eye.md) spell.

You can Sustain the Activation just as you would be able to [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md).
