# Dwarven Thrower *Item 13*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 2750 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This +2 striking warhammer is inlaid with precious metals and decorated with geometric patterns in a dwarven style. If you're a dwarf, a dwarven thrower functions for you as a +2 greater striking returning warhammer with the thrown <30 feet> trait, and your attacks with the hammer deal `1d8` additional damage against giants.
