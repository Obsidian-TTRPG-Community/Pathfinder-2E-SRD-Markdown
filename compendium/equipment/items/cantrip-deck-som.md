# Cantrip Deck *Item 1*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand

In an effort to spread the knowledge of magic as widely as possible, worshippers of [Nethys](compendium/setting/deities/nethys.md) discovered a way to bind cantrips into cards accessible even to non-spellcasters.

The deck contains thick parchment cards, each roughly half the size of a playing card. In precise, no-nonsense script, each card simply states the name of its cantrip, color-coded based on its school.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [V](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Varies") Varies ([>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") or more) envision, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You envision your desired cantrip, causing its card to rise to the top of the deck, and draw the card. The deck casts that cantrip as a 1st-level spell, with a DC of 15 and a spell attack modifier of +5. The card crumbles into dust as the cantrip takes effect. The activation takes the same number of actions as the cantrip you chose takes to cast.
