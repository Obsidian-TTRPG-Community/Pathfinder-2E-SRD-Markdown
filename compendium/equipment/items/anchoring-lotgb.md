# Anchoring *Item 10+*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Usage** etched onto a weapon

This rune prevents enemies from escaping your grasp by [fleeing](rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) to other planes. If you critically hit a target with an anchoring weapon, the weapon casts [dimensional anchor](compendium/spells/dimensional-anchor.md) on the target (DC 27, counteract modifier +17).

### Variants

#### anchoring *Item 10*

- **Price**: 900 gp

#### greater anchoring *Item 18*

- **Price**: 22000 gp

When you critically hit a target with a weapon with the anchoring rune, the weapon casts 8th-level [dimensional anchor](compendium/spells/dimensional-anchor.md) on the target (DC 38, counteract modifier +28), except that if the target critically succeeds at its Will save, instead of having no effect, the dimensional anchor lasts for 1 round.

When you hit a target with the weapon but don't critically hit, the target is affected by 4th-level [dimensional anchor](compendium/spells/dimensional-anchor.md) for 1 round without a save (this still uses a counteract modifier of +28).
