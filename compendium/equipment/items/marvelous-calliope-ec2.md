This large slide whistle appears to be made of fine brass, the sides of which are engraved with musical notes and dancing clowns.

You blow a tune upon the slide whistle, causing the whistle to expand. The whistle sprouts from one into several, and then creates a large wooden frame and keyboard.

By the time the unfolding is complete, the whistle fully transforms into a calliope, a wagon-sized contraption consisting of several steam whistles played like an organ. The calliope is heavy and anchored in place.

You have a +1 item bonus to [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks to play the calliope. The calliope has a tendency to produce music for a few seconds after you cease playing it, adding a jaunty and overlong conclusion to your music.

If you use an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to pull the small metal ring on the underside of the marvelous calliope, the calliope collapses back down into a slide whistle.

title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You play the calliope, causing it to cast [charm](compendium/spells/charm.md) on one of the listeners.
