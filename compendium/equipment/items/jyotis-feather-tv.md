A jyoti's feather is a shimmering red and gold feather, seeming almost metallic, although delicate and flexible to the touch.

Though most aren't made from true jyoti feathers, as the reclusive outsiders avoid visitors from the Material Plane, their connection to positive energy lent the spellhearts their name.

- Armor You gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against [death](rules/traits/death.md) effects and negative energy.
- Weapon The weapon has the disrupting rune while the feather is affixed.
