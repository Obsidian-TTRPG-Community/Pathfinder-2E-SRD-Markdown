Your features become thin and angular. You become swifter and nimbler, but your body also becomes fragile.

**Benefit** You gain an item bonus to [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) checks, [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks, [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) checks, Reflex saves, and Dexterity-based attack rolls, and you gain the listed status bonus to your Speed.
