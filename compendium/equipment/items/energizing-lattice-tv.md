# Energizing Lattice *Item 13*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 3000 gp
- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** worn armor

This suit of +2 resilient fortification lattice armor has latticework of fine golden wire. After negating a critical hit with its fortification rune, the latticework glows for 1 minute, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet). You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) this light.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") envision ([force](rules/traits/force.md))

- **Requirements**: The energizing lattice is glowing because it negated an enemy's critical hit

**Effect** You release the lattice's energy and make a weapon or unarmed attack [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that deals `6d6` additional force damage. If your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) fails, but doesn't critically fail, the target still takes half the force damage.

The latticework ceases glowing after the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
