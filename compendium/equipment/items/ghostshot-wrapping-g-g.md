# Ghostshot Wrapping *Item 11*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 300 gp
- **Bulk** â€“; **Usage** affixed to a ranged weapon
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You attempt a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the affixed weapon while [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) or [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected).

This long strip of linen is tightly wound around the barrel of the affixed firearm or the grip of a bow. When activated, the talisman's magic dampens the sound of the triggering shot, rendering it completely silent, and additionally skews the angle of the shot, so it appears to come from a different location and direction than your actual position. You don't become automatically [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed) to any creatures due to making the triggering [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
