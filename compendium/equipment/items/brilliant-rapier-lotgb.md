This rapier is formed entirely out of radiant energy, even more so than a usual brilliant weapon, and has left its physical form behind entirely. Instead of dealing piercing damage, it deals fire damage, and in addition to a rapier's normal weapon traits, it gains the versatile [good](rules/traits/good.md) or [positive](rules/traits/positive.md) trait.
