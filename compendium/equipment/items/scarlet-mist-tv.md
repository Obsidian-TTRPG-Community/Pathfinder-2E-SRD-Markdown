# Scarlet Mist *Item 8*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [injury](rules/traits/injury.md "Injury Item Trait")  [poison](rules/traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait")  

- **Price** 80 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 2 hands
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

Derived from a mixture of krooth venom and an agitating agent, scarlet mist causes bleeding that turns into a foaming mist. When a creature under the effects of scarlet mist takes [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from the toxin, creatures within 5 feet take the [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage. The [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) can't be staunched until the poison's effects end. A creature that can't bleed doesn't take the bleed damage or cause the [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage but can still take the poison damage.
