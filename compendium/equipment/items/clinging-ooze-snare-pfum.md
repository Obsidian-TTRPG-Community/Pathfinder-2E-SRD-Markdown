Complex traps that incorporate ooze monsters into their ingenious construction have long been a favorite of those who seek devious ways to protect their [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) laboratories, and it is from this tradition that the clinging ooze snare takes its inspiration. With its ingenious mixture of rare reagents, dried protoplasm harvested from ooze creatures, and a little pinch of alchemy, this snare triggers into an ooze-like hazard that temporarily mimics the dangers presented by a creature like a sewer ooze or other carnivorous protoplasmic monster. When a creature triggers a clinging ooze snare, the snare creates a short lived protoplasmic mass that lashes out in all directions, dealing `2d6` bludgeoning damage and `2d6` acid damage. The triggering creature must attempt a DC 21 Relfex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage
> - **Failure** The target takes full damage and is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of their next turn as the ooze impedes their movement.
> - **Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is both [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) and [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) for 1 round. The target can [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) (DC 21) to end this effect early.
