Hellknights wear a variety of armors decorated with designs specific to the order. [Hellknight half plate](compendium/equipment/items/hellknight-half-plate-tv.md) is the armor of choice for Hellknight signifiers, and [Hellknight breastplate](compendium/equipment/items/hellknight-breastplate-tv.md) serves those in the order who lack the training to wear heavy armor.

A character who is a member of the Hellknights has access to these uncommon armors.

Few armors in the Inner Sea region are as memorable as the iconic Hellknight plate. While each order has its own flourishes, Hellknight plate is instantly recognizable to any who know of the Hellknights.

Hellknights go to extreme measures to punish non-Hellknights who get their hands on Hellknight plate, and the reward is not usually worth the risk, since for non-Hellknights, the armor is functionally similar to [full plate](compendium/equipment/items/full-plate.md).
