- **Price** 30 gp

This elegant copper ring has miniature images of songbirds engraved around its circumference, and while you wear it, you sometimes can swear that you hear the sound of songbirds singing from somewhere within 60 feet, even when you're sure there aren't any birds around. You gain a +1 item bonus to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks.

You can throw your voice for 10 minutes. Whenever you speak or make any other sound vocally, you can make your vocalization seem to originate from somewhere else within 60 feet, and you can change that apparent location freely as you vocalize. Any creature that hears the sound can attempt a DC 19 Perception check to overcome the illusion and determine the truth.
