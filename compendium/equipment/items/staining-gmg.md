# Staining *Item 1*  
[cursed](rules/traits/cursed-gmg.md "Cursed Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Usage** curses gear or a weapon

This property is associated with a specific color, which is defined at the time of the curse's creation. Whenever you use the affected equipment while taking a [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") action with another object, the second object is permanently stained the associated color. For instance, if you used a set of yellow _staining lockpicks_ to open a door, the lock would permanently become yellow. This color change does not otherwise unnaturally persist and can be changed via any normal mundane or magical means.
