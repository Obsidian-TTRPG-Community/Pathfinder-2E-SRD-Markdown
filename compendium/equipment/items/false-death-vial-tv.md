# False Death Vial *Item 13+*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** —; **Usage** affixed to explorer's clothing (or another item in the unarmored defense category)
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You would be reduced to 0 Hit Points by damage but not immediately killed; **Requirements** You are unarmored.

This tiny crystal vial of oily liquid is typically attached to a pin or worn on a tether attached to the affixed article of clothing.

When you Activate the vial, you avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point, your [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition increases by 1, and the talisman casts drop dead on you. You and any items you're wearing and holding are instantly transported from your current space to a clear space of your choice within range. You take no damage from the triggering effect. If you are carrying another creature (even one contained inside an extradimensional container), it's left behind in your original space.

### Variants

#### false death vial *Item 13*

- **Price**: 600 gp

#### greater false death vial *Item 16*

- **Price**: 2000 gp

The talisman also teleports you to a clear space of your choice that you can see within 120 feet. This also transports any items you're wearing and holding with you, but if this would bring another creature with you—even if you're carrying it in an extradimensional container—the teleportation is canceled.

This effect has the [teleportation](rules/traits/teleportation.md "Teleportation Effect Trait") trait.
