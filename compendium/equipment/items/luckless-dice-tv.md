Carved of bone, luckless dice appear to be a set of loaded dice (Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar 58). If unsuccessfully identified as cursed, luckless dice seem to hold a minor enchantment that improves your luck. However, they fuse to you when you use them, cursing you with ill fortune. Luckless dice don't grant a bonus on [Games Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) checks. Instead, when you use them to gamble, the GM rolls secretly, granting you the lower result. Once you realize the dice are cursed, the GM can instead allow you to roll twice and take the lower result.
