# Marvelous Medicines *Item 12+*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 2 hands

This set of healer's tools contains a seemingly endless supply of bandages, herbs, and healing items of impeccable quality, granting you a +2 item bonus to [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Treat Poison](rules/actions/treat-poison.md) or 8 hours ([Treat Disease](rules/actions/treat-disease.md))


You can activate the tools when you use them to [Treat Poison](rules/actions/treat-poison.md) in order to produce the effects of neutralize poison, or when you [Treat Disease](rules/actions/treat-disease.md) in order to produce the effects of remove disease. Once these medicines have been used to treat a patient's poison or disease, they can't be used again to treat the same affliction for that patient.
