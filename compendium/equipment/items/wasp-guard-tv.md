# Wasp Guard *Item 8*

- **Price** 487 gp
- **Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Armor

Druids and [Calistria](compendium/setting/deities/calistria.md)'s faithful alike value this vindictive armor for its ability to turn away pests and exact revenge on foes in a manner that can easily turn coordinated enemies into a chaotic mass. Wasp guard is +1 studded leather studded with the carapaces of wasps, subtly diverting swarms away and granting a +1 item bonus to Reflex saving throws against Swarming Bites, Swarming Stings, and similar abilities from swarms.

- **Trigger**: An enemy within 30 feet Strikes you with an attack

**Effect** You animate the exoskeletons of the wasp guard armor into a spectral swarm of wasps that seeks revenge for the slight. The swarm flies to the triggering enemy's space and swarms about them, dealing `1d8` [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). If the affected enemy has any allies within 30 feet, the enemy can spend a single action, which has the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait, to shoo the swarm away. This ends the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) on that enemy automatically, but the swarm instead moves to affect the enemy's ally.
