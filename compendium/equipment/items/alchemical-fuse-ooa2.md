An alchemical fuse is a length of treated cord that can be used to time the detonation of an alchemical bomb or a stick of pyronite, or simply as a timerâ€”at the GM's option, fuses can be used as timers to trigger other devices that can be triggered with a single appropriate action, as well.

You attach the alchemical fuse to an alchemical bomb, stick of pyronite, or other device that can be triggered by a fuse. Alternately, you can attach one fuse to another to extend its burn time by 1 round.

You light the alchemical fuse with an adjacent fire source or a fire source that you hold in a hand. If you have a tindertwig in your other hand, you can activate the tindertwig and use it to light a fuse with the same [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action. A lit fuse takes 1 round per attached fuse to burn down. During the round that the fuse runs out, the device to which the fuse has been attached explodes or otherwise activates at the end of your turn.

For a bomb, this deals splash damage, and for pyronite, it deals pyronite's normal damage. An alchemical fuse burns underwater or in up to moderate wind.

You extinguish the fuse.
