All herd masks are linked to at least one other herd mask and are usually sold in sets of multiple masks. Linked herd masks look like one another, with only the slightest of differences to tell them apart.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You swap locations with another creature wearing a linked herd mask within 100 feet. If you and the creature you swapped with are disguised as each other, other creatures gain an immediate [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check against the lower of your or the other wearer's [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) DCs to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) each other. On a failure, they don't realize the swap occurred.
