# Dimension Shot *Item 12*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 360 gp
- **Ammunition** any
- **Activate** command, envision

Dimension shot is deep blue black, but motes of light play upon it like stars in the night sky. The activated ammunition allows you to teleport to a location near where the ammunition hits.

If you hit a creature, you can teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to that creature. If you fire at a square, you can teleport to a space that contains that square or an unoccupied space adjacent to it. The teleportation fails if no unoccupied space is available to you.
