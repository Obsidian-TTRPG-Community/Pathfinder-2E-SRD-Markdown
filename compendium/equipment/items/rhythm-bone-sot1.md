# Rhythm Bone *Item 1*

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Held

This small, enchanted bone (most often a jaw) is usually capped with metal at its ends. It's activated by striking it against a hard surface.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

The bone begins recording the next 1 minute of ambient sounds (including speech) that require a DC 15 or lower [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check to hear.

The bone's recording doesn't copy magical [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md) effects, such as those of spellcasting, a harpy's song, or a banshee's wail. Once the rhythm bone has been activated in this way, it retains the recorded sound for the rest of its existence and can't be activated this way again.

The bone replays its recorded sounds.
