# Bountiful Cauldron *Item 9*

This mid-sized, silver cauldron is a boon within areas where access to fresh food is limited, for it can be commanded to fill itself with hearty (and delicious) vegetable stew. It can also be put to a much greater use in the pursuit of crafting certain items.

When used to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) alchemical items, potions, or oils, a _bountiful cauldron_ grants a +2 item bonus to the [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You stir the cauldron, and it casts a 4th-level [create food](compendium/spells/create-food.md) spell, filling itself with enough delicious vegetable stew to feed 12 Medium creatures.
