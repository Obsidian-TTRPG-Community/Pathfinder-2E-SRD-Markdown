# Tripod *Item 0*

Tripods are designed for use with kickback weapons, as a way for gunslingers with lower strength to accurately use these more powerful weapons by sacrificing mobility instead. They can be set up and attached to a firearm with a single [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action using one hand, setting the tripod in your square. While this sturdy piece of engineering is in use, you don't take the â€“2 penalty for firing a [kickback](rules/traits/kickback-g-g.md "Kickback Weapon Trait") weapon, even if your Strength isn't high enough to avoid the penalty. However, you must retrieve the tripod with a single [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action before you can move the firearm to a different position. Normally, when you're [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) or [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected), you become [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed) if you do anything except [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md), [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md), or [Step](rules/actions/step.md). However, deploying or retrieving a tripod with an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action doesn't automatically make you [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed), so long as you don't set up or remove the tripod when it's in a spot where creatures can see the tripod itself.
