Repurposing and enchanting a helmet worn by a battlefield commander can create a tactician's helm, imparting knowledge of battlefield tactics that feeds off your minor victories. The helm grants you a +1 item bonus to [Warfare Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) checks. Also, a jewel adorns the brow of the helmet. This jewel becomes charged each time you hit a creature with an [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md). A tactician's helm can hold up to 2 charges, and its charges reset to 0 when you invest it.
