# Staring Skull *Item 8*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [tattoo](rules/traits/tattoo-lowg.md "Tattoo Item Trait")  

- **Price** 550 gp
- **Bulk** —; **Usage** tattooed on the body

This tattoo usually depicts a humanoid skull with staring eyes in its sockets, but any creature with two eyes and a skull is possible, such as a wolf, phoenix, or psychopomp. When your [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition increases to a value that would kill you, this tattoo reduces your [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) value to 1 fewer than would kill you. If a [death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait") effect would kill you—provided the effect is from a creature of 8th level or lower or a spell of 4th level or lower—this tattoo activates and keeps you alive instead. You can benefit from this ability only once per day. Each time the tattoo prevents you from [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying), one of its eyes disappears, the image now featuring either an empty socket or an eyepatch or other covering. After both eyes vanish, the tattoo becomes non-magical and no longer protects you. If you receive a new staring skull tattoo, any other you have loses its staring eyes and becomes non-magical.
