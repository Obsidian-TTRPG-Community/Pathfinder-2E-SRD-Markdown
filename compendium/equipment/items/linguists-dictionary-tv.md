- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Requirements**: Your last action was to cast a spell prepared from this grimoire that allows understanding of another language, such as comprehend languages or tongues

**Effect** The grimoire absorbs knowledge of one language translated this way (caster's choice if more than one), allowing its bearer to communicate on a rudimentary level in that language even after the spell's duration has elapsed. The linguist's dictionary can hold one language at a time.
