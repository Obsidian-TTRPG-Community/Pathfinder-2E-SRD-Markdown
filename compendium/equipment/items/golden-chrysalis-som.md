# Golden Chrysalis *Item 5*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  ammunition  

- **Price** 27 gp
- **Ammunition** sling bullet
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

Threads of iridescent golden silk wrap around the core of this magical sling stone. When you activate and shoot a golden chrysalis, rather than making an attack roll for your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), you cause the chrysalis to unwind in midair to reveal a magical butterfly that flies in a 30-foot line, scattering golden scale dust that hangs in the air for 1 minute.

A creature that enters or begins its turn in the dust must attempt a DC 19 Reflex save or have its invisibility negated, becoming [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) instead of [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible). This effect applies both if the creature was already [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) and if it benefits from any new invisibility effects before the end of the invisibility negation effect from the golden chrysalis.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target's invisibility is negated for 2 rounds.
> - **Failure** The target is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute and its invisibility is negated for 1 minute.
