# Net *Item 0*  

- **Price** 1 gp
- **Bulk** 1
- **Hands** 2

You can use a net either on its own or attached to a rope. When attached to a rope, you can use the net to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) a Medium or smaller creature up to 10 feet away (instead of only adjacent creatures). You can continue to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) to keep your hold on the target so long as the target remains within 10 feet and you continue to hold the net. The grabbed creature gains a +2 circumstance bonus to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) unless you are adjacent to them, and it can attempt a DC 16 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Force Open](rules/actions/force-open.md) the net entirely. Once the target is no longer [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), the net is unwieldy until refolded as a [Concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") action that requires two hands; if used without being refolded, [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) checks made with the net take a –2 penalty.

When the net is unattached, you can attempt a ranged attack roll against a Medium or smaller creature within 20 feet. On a hit, the target is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) and takes a –10- foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it Escapes, and on a critical hit, it's also [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) until it Escapes. The [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) DC is 16. A creature adjacent to the target can [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to remove the net.
