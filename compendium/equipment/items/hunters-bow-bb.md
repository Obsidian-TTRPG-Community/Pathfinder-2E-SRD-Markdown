# Hunter's Bow *Item 3*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Price** 60 gp
- **Category** Weapon

Stealthy hunters and rogues can use this shortbow to attack from hiding. If you use this bow to [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) a target that can't see you and you get a critical hit, the target takes an extra `1d6` damage (this is in addition to sneak attack damage if you're a rogue).
