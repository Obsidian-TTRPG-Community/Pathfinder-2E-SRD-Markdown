A weapon with a hopeful rune exudes positivity. On a critical hit with this weapon, you inspire your comrades, pushing them to fight harder and stand for your shared convictions. Allies within 30 feet that share at least one alignment component with you gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn.
