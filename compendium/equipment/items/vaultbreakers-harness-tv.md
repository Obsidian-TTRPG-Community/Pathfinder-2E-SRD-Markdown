# Vaultbreaker's Harness *Item 6*  
[invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 230 gp

A vaultbreaker's harness has four pockets across the chest. The pockets contain a set of infiltrator's thieves' tools, infiltrator picks, a levered crowbar, and a glass cutter. These items are magically bound to the harness; if they are more than 1 foot away from you, they disappear, then reappear in the harness at the next sunset. [Broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) or destroyed items similarly reappear, restored, in their proper pockets at sunset.

You cinch the harness to prepare for mischief. You gain a +1 item bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks and a +10-foot item bonus to your Speed for 1 minute.
