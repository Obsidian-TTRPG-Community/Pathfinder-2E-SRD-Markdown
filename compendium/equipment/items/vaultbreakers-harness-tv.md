A vaultbreaker's harness has four pockets across the chest. The pockets contain a set of infiltrator's thieves' tools, infiltrator picks, a levered crowbar, and a glass cutter. These items are magically bound to the harness; if they are more than 1 foot away from you, they disappear, then reappear in the harness at the next sunset. [Broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) or destroyed items similarly reappear, restored, in their proper pockets at sunset.
