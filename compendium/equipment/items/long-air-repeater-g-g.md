Like the [one-handed air repeater](compendium/equipment/items/air-repeater-g-g.md), this thin-barreled firearm uses a container of pressurized air instead of black powder to propel small metal pellets from an attached cartridge. The long air repeater has better range and ammo capacity than the [one-handed variant](compendium/equipment/items/air-repeater-g-g.md), though it still lacks significant stopping power. A typical long air repeater magazine holds 8 pellets.
