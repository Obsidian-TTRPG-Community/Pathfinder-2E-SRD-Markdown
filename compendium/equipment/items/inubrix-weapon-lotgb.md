# Inubrix Weapon *Item 11+*  
[rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** varies by weapon; **Bulk** varies by weapon
- **Category** Material

While inubrix weapons don't pack the same punch as more durable weapons, they have the unique ability to bypass some of the protections offered by metal armors and shields.

A weapon crafted from inubrix reduces the weapon's damage die by 1 size. However, they ignore the resistance to damage from metal armor's armor specialization effects and the circumstance bonus to AC from metal shields.

[Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) with inubrix weapons don't trigger the Shield Block reaction from a metal shield. Weapons that normally deal `1d4` damage can't be crafted from inubrix.
