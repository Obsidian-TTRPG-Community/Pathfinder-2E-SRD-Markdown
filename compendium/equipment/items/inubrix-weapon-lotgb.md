# Inubrix Weapon *Item 11+*  
[rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** varies by weapon; **Usage** varies by weapon

While inubrix weapons don't pack the same punch as more durable weapons, they have the unique ability to bypass some of the protections offered by metal armors and shields.

A weapon crafted from inubrix reduces the weapon's damage die by 1 size. However, they ignore the resistance to damage from metal armor's armor specialization effects and the circumstance bonus to AC from metal shields.

[Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) with inubrix weapons don't trigger the Shield Block reaction from a metal shield. Weapons that normally deal `1d4` damage can't be crafted from inubrix.
