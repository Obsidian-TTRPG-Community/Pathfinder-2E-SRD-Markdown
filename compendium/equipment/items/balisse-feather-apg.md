This long, fire-red feather seems to catch flame every time the weapon it adorns strikes a purveyor of evil. When you activate the feather, the creature you damaged burns with holy light. The creature must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or take a â€“2 status penalty to AC and saving throws and reduce its resistances by 5. These effects last until the end of your next turn.
