[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 400 gp
- **Usage** affixed to a weapon
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You deal damage using the affixed weapon to a creature you have seen commit an evil act.

This long, fire-red feather seems to catch flame every time the weapon it adorns strikes a purveyor of evil. When you activate the feather, the creature you damaged burns with holy light. The creature must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or take a â€“2 status penalty to AC and saving throws and reduce its resistances by 5. These effects last until the end of your next turn.
