Before activation, this item appears to be nothing more than a simple rolled-up tent, barely large enough to fit four Medium creatures. Despite attempts to clean it, the tent is perpetually smudged with dirt in various places.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [‚è≤](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency")

The rolled-up tent expands into a spacious yurt complete with a fire pit, 10 [bedrolls](compendium/equipment/items/bedroll.md), various cooking utensils, and basic food and water.

The yurt can house and feed you and up to nine other Medium creatures that eat roughly as much as a human does; they need not attempt a [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) check to [Subsist](rules/actions/subsist.md) when you use the yurt. Fires and light inside the yurt do not extend illumination into the area surrounding the yurt, making it harder to spot from a distance.

A large loop of red cloth hangs from one wall. If this loop is pulled, which takes an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action, the entire yurt immediately folds back up into its deactivated form, ready for further travel.
