A shatterstone is a small ceramic orb, much like a thunderstone.

Inside are reactive agents that set up an intense field of sonic vibration when the stone breaks. The bomb grants an item bonus to attack rolls and deals sonic damage and sonic splash damage, according to the bomb's type. Much of the sound is ultrasonic, and creatures with sonic weakness that take damage from the bomb must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw at the listed DC or be [deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened) until the end of their next turn.
