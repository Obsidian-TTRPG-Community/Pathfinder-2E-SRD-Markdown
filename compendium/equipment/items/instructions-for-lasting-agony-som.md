This worn and stained manual emits a chill when opened.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") envision ([metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md))

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** If your next action is to cast a harmful necromancy spell that you prepared from this grimoire and that allows a saving throw, you warp and twist negative energy into the spell to cause intense pain. If the target fails its saving throw against the spell, it becomes [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) by the pain.
