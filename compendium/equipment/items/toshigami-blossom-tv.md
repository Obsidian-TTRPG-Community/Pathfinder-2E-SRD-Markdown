- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** worn

An encounter with a toshigami, the enigmatic kami who protect cherry trees, is rare, though often sought after and treasured by those who achieve such an encounter. Only a handful of mortals can truthfully claim to have seen a toshigami, let alone met one, though many popular fireside tales tell of virtuous souls receiving a toshigami's blessing to fight for a worthy cause. Such stories have a basis in fact; every so often, a toshigami gives a worthy mortal a flower from their ward, time-locked in perfect bloom and granted sapience. Such toshigami blossoms are more sociable than their creators. Like toshigami, a blossom has a strong curiosity about the mortal world. If you wear a toshigami blossom, it can intercede for you, helping you make a good impression.

A toshigami blossom has the following activations.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, envision

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** The blossom casts soothing blossoms (Secrets of Magic 129) to your specifications.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") command

- **Frequency**: once per minute

**Effect** The blossom sends a flurry of cherry blossoms outward in a 20-foot burst that lasts 1 round. You and your allies can see through these blossoms. To all other creatures, creatures within the cloud of blossoms become [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed), and creatures outside the cloud become [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to creatures within it. When you or an ally succeeds with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a creature in the blossoms, the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) deals an additional `1d6` mental damage and an additional `1d6` negative damage to living creatures, or an additional `1d6` positive damage to undead.
