# Fearcracker *Item 5*  
[catalyst](rules/traits/catalyst-som.md "Catalyst Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")

A fearcracker contains fragments of [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) mirrors and reagents that pop and smoke when consumed. When thrown down in your space as part of a [mirror image](compendium/spells/mirror-image.md) spell, your and your images' appearance twists nightmarishly. When an image is destroyed, it "dies" in a disturbing fashion, rendering the attacker [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened). This aspect of the spell has the emotion, [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait"), and [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") traits.
