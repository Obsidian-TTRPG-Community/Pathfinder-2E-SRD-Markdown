A fearcracker contains fragments of [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) mirrors and reagents that pop and smoke when consumed. When thrown down in your space as part of a [mirror image](compendium/spells/mirror-image.md) spell, your and your images' appearance twists nightmarishly. When an image is destroyed, it "dies" in a disturbing fashion, rendering the attacker [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened). This aspect of the spell has the emotion, [fear](rules/traits/fear.md), and [mental](rules/traits/mental.md) traits.
