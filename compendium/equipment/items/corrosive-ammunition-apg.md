# Corrosive Ammunition *Item 7*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md)  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Price** 70 gp
- **Ammunition** any
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)
- **Category** Consumable

This peculiar ammunition is coated in yellow dust that leaves a stain on anything it touches. When activated corrosive ammunition hits a target, it dissolves across the target's armor. The armor takes `1d8` [persistent acid damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) that ignores the armor's Hardness; if the target isn't wearing armor, it takes the acid damage instead. This damage occurs at the end of the target's turns.

The creature can end this effect by spending an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to wipe off the corrosive dust, and otherwise the effect ends once the armor becomes [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken).
