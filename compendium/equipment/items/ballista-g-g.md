# Ballista *Item 5*  
[large](rules/traits/large-b1.md "Large Size Trait")  [mounted](rules/traits/mounted-g-g.md "Mounted Weapon Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 320 gp
- **Usage** mounted

Resembling a massive crossbow mounted on a tripod, but with a pair of arms for torsion instead of a single prod, a ballista flings massive bolts. Also referred to as a scorpion, this weapon requires fewer crew members than the larger heavy ballista and can be Aimed and Loaded much more quickly.
