Cayden's brew is like rich beer or ale, with a golden-brown color and foamy head. For 1 hour after you drink it, you have a +1 item bonus to saving throws against [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effects. Also, you can use a single action to breathe out a 15-foot cone of intoxicating vapor with a burp that can be heard for 100 feet. Any creature in the vapor must attempt a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw. After you use this breath weapon, you can't do so again for `1d4` rounds.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The creature is [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for `1d4` rounds.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature becomes [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy), [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied), and [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened). The [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) conditions last until `1d4` rounds after the [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition ends.
