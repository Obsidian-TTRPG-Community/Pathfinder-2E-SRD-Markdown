# Heedless Spurs *Item 15*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 5200 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn anklets

These wicked-looking spiked metal wheels fit around the ankles and jingle when the wearer walks, imposing a –1 item penalty on [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks. If used as a weapon, they are treated as a spiked gauntlet.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Requirements**: You are riding a mount

**Effect** You kick both spurs into your mount's flank. Your mount takes `2d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and gains the [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) condition for 1 minute or until the [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) ends, whichever comes first. It can use the extra action only to [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md).
