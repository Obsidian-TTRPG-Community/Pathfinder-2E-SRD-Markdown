# Gelid Shard *Item 2*  
[arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait")  [artifact](rules/traits/artifact-gmg.md "Artifact Item Trait")  [cold](rules/traits/cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  


This crystal shard shimmers with its own light even as it seems to draw the heat out of its surroundings. Plunging it into your heart grants you the tranquil lethality of deepest winter, but the more you draw upon its power, the colder your heart grows. Your frozen heart dulls your emotions. When you gain a bonus from an [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effect, that bonus is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 0. At 10th level, the bonus is reduced by 2. Your dulled emotions make it hard to relate to others; the DC of checks to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) or [Request](rules/actions/request.md) a favor of other creatures, or to [Aid](rules/actions/aid.md) in such attempts, is increased by +2. You gain resistance to cold equal to your level and a +2 status bonus to all saves against [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effects.

Destruction The gelid shard must be left exposed in the Plane of Fire for a week and a day, then smashed with an adamantine hammer by someone who felt true love for the shard's creator.
