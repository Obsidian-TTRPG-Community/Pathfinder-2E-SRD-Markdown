This vial contains magical water blessed by a good deity. You can throw it as a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). _Holy water_ is a simple thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. It shatters on a hit, dealing `1d6+1` good damage to the target and 1 good damage to every other creature within 5 feet of the target. _Holy water_ damages only undead.
