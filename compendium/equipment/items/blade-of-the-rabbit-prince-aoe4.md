# Blade Of The Rabbit Prince *Item 15*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 6250 gp
- **Craft Requirements** You must craft the blade in the Harrowed Realm.
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This +2 greater striking dancing shortsword has a golden handguard resembling a bird with outstretched wings. The sword's blade is [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) halfway up its length, but this doesn't impair the sword's function.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You attempt to [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) or [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) an opponent using [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) instead of [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics), and you add the blade of the Rabbit Prince's item bonus to the check. You do not need to have a hand free if you're wielding the blade of the Rabbit Prince, and your target can be up to two sizes larger than you.
