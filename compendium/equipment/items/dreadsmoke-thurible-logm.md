This black-and-gray thurible is decorated with a skeleton motif; the jaw of one of the decorative skulls unhinges, allowing you to load it with incense as an action. A long, thin chain is connected to the top of the thurible.

You swing the thurible around you, spreading inky black smoke in a 20-foot emanation that has the effect of obscuring mist.

Undead creatures can see through the smoke as if it didn't exist. Negative energy also disrupts the magic of the smoke; anyone who uses a [negative](rules/traits/negative.md) effect, along with creatures affected by a [negative](rules/traits/negative.md) effect, can see through the smoke for 1 round.
