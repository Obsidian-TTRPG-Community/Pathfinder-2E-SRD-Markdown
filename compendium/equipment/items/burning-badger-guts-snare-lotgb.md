# Burning Badger Guts Snare *Item 10*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [snare](rules/traits/snare.md "Snare Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 170 gp

When a creature enters the trapped square, putrefied badger guts coated in hyper-flammable oil and several other incendiary reactants catch fire and are dumped in the snare's square, as well as up to two adjacent squares that you choose when you set the snare. The burning oil deals `5d8` fire damage to any creatures in the affected squares. Those creatures must attempt a DC 27 Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage and `1d8` [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and `2d8` [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
