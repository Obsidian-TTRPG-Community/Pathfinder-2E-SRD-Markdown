[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [sleep](rules/traits/sleep.md "Sleep Effect Trait")  

- **Price** 11 gp
- **Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of sleep.
- **Ammunition** [arrow](compendium/equipment/items/arrow.md)
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

Sleep arrows often have shafts of deep blue or black, and their fletching is exceptionally soft and downy. An activated sleep arrow deals no damage, but a living creature hit by it is subject to the effects of a [sleep](compendium/spells/sleep.md) spell (DC 17).
