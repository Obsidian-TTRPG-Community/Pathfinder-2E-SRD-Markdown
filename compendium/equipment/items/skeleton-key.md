# Skeleton Key *Item 5+*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** held in 1 hand

A grinning skull tops the bow of this macabre key. This key can be used in place of [thieves' tools](compendium/equipment/items/thieves-tools.md) when attempting to [Pick a Lock](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md), and it grants a +1 item bonus to the [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check.

If the skeleton key becomes [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) due to a critical failure on the check, it works as normal [thieves' tools](compendium/equipment/items/thieves-tools.md) and loses its benefits until repaired.
