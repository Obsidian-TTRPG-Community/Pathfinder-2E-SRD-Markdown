# Sextant of the Night *Item 4*  
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 95 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This finely wrought sextant is made from silver with several onyx mirrors and shades made from thin sets of crystal glass. A fine spyglass made of silver is affixed to the frame; removing the spyglass destroys the sextant. By all appearances, the sextant shouldn't function, as the shades and mirrors are swapped, but when you look through the spyglass, you see a night sky during the day and the sun during the night, as if day and night were inverted.

When you use the sextant, you gain a +1 item bonus to [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) checks, which increases to a +2 item bonus when you [Sense Direction](rules/actions/sense-direction.md).
