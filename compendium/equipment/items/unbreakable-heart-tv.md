The name of your beloved adorns this stylized image of a heart.

An unbreakable heart tattoo can be received only at the end of a successful heartbond ritual (Pathfinder Advanced Player's Guide 242), serving as your token. The other participant can have a token other than a tattoo if they wish. If you have more than one heartbond, each unbreakable heart you have serves as a token for only one of them.

The love exuding from you grants you a +1 item bonus to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks. When you use heartbond's activity to learn your beloved's present state, you can also grant them a small gift, choosing from the following options each time. Make your choice after learning their state.

- Your beloved gains 5 temporary Hit Points that last for 10 minutes.
- The tattoo casts guidance on your beloved.
- The tattoo casts stabilize on your beloved.
- The tattoo casts light on your beloved's token from heartbond.
