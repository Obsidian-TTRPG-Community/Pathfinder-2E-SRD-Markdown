- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** Up to two firearms currently holstered in the immaculate holsters are instantly cleaned and oiled, protecting them from accidental misfires (though not misfires caused as a result of using a feat or ability). The holstered weapons are also reloaded with non-magical 0-level ammunition appropriate to a weapon of their type; if a firearm has multiple chambers, such as a slide pistol, each empty chamber is loaded. Immaculate holsters can't reload the cartridge of a repeating weapon.
