[apex](rules/traits/apex.md "Apex Item Trait")  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 40000 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn cape

This black cape flows more like a vaporous liquid than fabric. The cape grants you a +3 item bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks. When you invest the cape, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger**: A creature misses you with an attack

**Effect** Attempt a [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check against the triggering creature's [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC. If you roll a success, you're [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from that creature until the end of your next turn or until right after you use a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action against that creature. If you roll a critical success, you're [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from that creature until the end of your next turn, even if you use [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) actions against that creature.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** With a twirl of the cape, you transform yourself into a puff of gray smoke. You cast [gaseous form](compendium/spells/gaseous-form.md) on yourself.
