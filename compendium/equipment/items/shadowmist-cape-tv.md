This black cape flows more like a vaporous liquid than fabric. The cape grants you a +3 item bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks. When you invest the cape, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.

- **Trigger**: A creature misses you with an attack

**Effect** Attempt a [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check against the triggering creature's [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC. If you roll a success, you're [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from that creature until the end of your next turn or until right after you use a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action against that creature. If you roll a critical success, you're [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from that creature until the end of your next turn, even if you use [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) actions against that creature.

With a twirl of the cape, you transform yourself into a puff of gray smoke. You cast [gaseous form](compendium/spells/gaseous-form.md) on yourself.
