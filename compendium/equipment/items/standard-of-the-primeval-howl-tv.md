# Standard of the Primeval Howl *Item 10*  
[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Price** 900 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

These standards are always constructed from uncut wood and a leather banner painted with the visage of a snarling beast—a wolf, boar, bear, lion, dragon, or similarly imposing creature. And while it might become lost on a battlefield scattered with gaudier standards, its effect bolsters those around a competent leader. When carrying this banner, you gain a +1 item bonus to [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks and initiative rolls, and creatures in a 20-foot emanation also gain a +1 item bonus to initiative checks.
