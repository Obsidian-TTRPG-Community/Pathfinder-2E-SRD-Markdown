# Cold Iron Armor *Item 5+*  

- **Bulk** varies by armor; **Usage** worn armor

Cold iron armor sickens certain creatures that touch it. A creature with weakness to cold iron (such as most demons and fey) that critically fails an unarmed attack against a creature in cold iron armor becomes [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened). A creature with weakness to cold iron is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) as long as it wears cold iron armor.
