Miniature octopus arms press up against the sides of this bottle, obscuring the rest of its contents. When opened, a Huge octopus bursts forth, which can appear in water instead of on the ground. Its arms attempt to grasp a creature with a reach of 15 feet. The octopus repositions that creature to a different space within its reach unless the target succeeds at a DC 24 Fortitude save.

If the octopus is in water, it then releases a cloud of ink in a 30-foot emanation. This cloud has no effect outside of water.

Creatures inside the cloud are [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) and can't use their sense of smell. The cloud dissipates after 1 minute.
