The silver face of this glass-encased compass is etched with dozens of esoteric symbols, obscure icons, and inscrutable abbreviations.

[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  

You point the compass of transpositional awareness at an extant [teleportation](rules/traits/teleportation.md) effect (such as a magical portal) or the site of a [teleportation](rules/traits/teleportation.md) effect that existed within the last 1 minute (such as the space where a creature just cast [dimension door](compendium/spells/dimension-door.md)). Attempt an [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) check to determine to where the effect leads or led. The DC of this check is the effect's counteract DC. On a success, you know roughly the destination of the [teleportation](rules/traits/teleportation.md) effect (for example "the Plane of Fire," "north," or "Avistan"). On a critical success, you ascertain the exact destination within mere feet for local effects (such as dimension door) or within a few miles for long-range effects (such as teleport, plane shift, or interdimensional portals).

You use the compass of transpositional awareness to triangulate your current coordinates and the coordinates of your intended destination using teleportation magic. For 1 minute, whenever you cast a teleportation spell that has a range, increase that spell's range by 30 feet. If the spell normally has a range of touch, extend its range to 30 feet.
