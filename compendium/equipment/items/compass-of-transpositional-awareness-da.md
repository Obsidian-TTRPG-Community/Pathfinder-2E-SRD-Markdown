# Compass of Transpositional Awareness *Item 10*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [teleportation](rules/traits/teleportation.md "Teleportation Effect Trait")  

- **Price** 950 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

The silver face of this glass-encased compass is etched with dozens of esoteric symbols, obscure icons, and inscrutable abbreviations.

title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) ([concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md))

- **Frequency**: once per minute

**Effect** You point the compass of transpositional awareness at an extant [teleportation](rules/traits/teleportation.md "Teleportation Effect Trait") effect (such as a magical portal) or the site of a [teleportation](rules/traits/teleportation.md "Teleportation Effect Trait") effect that existed within the last 1 minute (such as the space where a creature just cast [dimension door](compendium/spells/dimension-door.md)). Attempt an [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) check to determine to where the effect leads or led. The DC of this check is the effect's counteract DC. On a success, you know roughly the destination of the [teleportation](rules/traits/teleportation.md "Teleportation Effect Trait") effect (for example "the Plane of Fire," "north," or "Avistan"). On a critical success, you ascertain the exact destination within mere feet for local effects (such as dimension door) or within a few miles for long-range effects (such as teleport, plane shift, or interdimensional portals).

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You use the compass of transpositional awareness to triangulate your current coordinates and the coordinates of your intended destination using teleportation magic. For 1 minute, whenever you cast a teleportation spell that has a range, increase that spell's range by 30 feet. If the spell normally has a range of touch, extend its range to 30 feet.
