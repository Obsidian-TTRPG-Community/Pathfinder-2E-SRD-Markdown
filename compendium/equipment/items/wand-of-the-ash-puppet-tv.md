# Wand of the Ash Puppet *Item 14*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [wand](rules/traits/wand.md "Wand Item Trait")  

- **Price** 4500 gp
- **Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of disintegrate.
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This wand is composed of ash that has been compressed, shaped, and sealed with a clear lacquer. When you trace the wand's tip along a solid surface, it leaves a black trail of charcoal. Writing with the wand in this way never damages or wears the wand down.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day, plus overcharge

**Effect** You cast [disintegrate](compendium/spells/disintegrate.md). If the spell reduces a living creature to fine powder, you animate that creature's ashes into a sulfur zombie (Pathfinder Bestiary 3 303) with the same general appearance as the disintegrated creature.

You control this sulfur zombie, which gains the [minion](rules/traits/minion.md "Minion Creature Trait") and [summoned](rules/traits/summoned.md "Summoned Creature Trait") traits. You can issue a verbal command to the sulfur zombie as a single action with the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") and [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") traits. The sulfur zombie crumbles into inanimate ash when reduced to 0 Hit Points or after 1 minute, whichever comes first.
