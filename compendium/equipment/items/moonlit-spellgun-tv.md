Elegant silver filigree contains the body of this ephemeral item, which is made of solid light. Its shape resembles a pistol, and it's often carried by hunters of werecreatures, vampires, and devils.

You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target's AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet.

The spellgun emits a silvery ray of pure moonlight that deals fire damage depending on its type. The spellgun's damage is treated as silver for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like.

> [!success-degree]

> - **Success** The target takes full damage and is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until the start of your next turn.
