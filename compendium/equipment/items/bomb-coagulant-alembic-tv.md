# Bomb Coagulant Alembic *Item 5*  
[additive <0>](rules/traits/additive-0.md "Additive Feat Trait")  [alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 150 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in two hands

This apparatus increases the viscosity of the reagents in alchemical bombs, to [deadly](rules/traits/deadly.md "Deadly Weapon Trait") effect. As a 10-minute activity that has the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") trait, you can use a bomb coagulant alembic to distill the contents of one alchemical bomb that deals splash damage into a stickier substance. After distilling, the bomb deals no splash damage but instead deals [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to and of the same type as its original splash damage. If the bomb already deals [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), distilling increases that damage by the bomb's original splash damage.
