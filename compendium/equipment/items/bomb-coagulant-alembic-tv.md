This apparatus increases the viscosity of the reagents in alchemical bombs, to [deadly](rules/traits/deadly.md) effect. As a 10-minute activity that has the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait, you can use a bomb coagulant alembic to distill the contents of one alchemical bomb that deals splash damage into a stickier substance. After distilling, the bomb deals no splash damage but instead deals [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to and of the same type as its original splash damage. If the bomb already deals [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), distilling increases that damage by the bomb's original splash damage.
