# Striking *Item 4+*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Usage** etched onto a weapon
- **Category** Rune

A striking rune stores destructive magic in the weapon, increasing the weapon damage dice it deals to two instead of one. For instance, a +1 striking dagger would deal `2d4` damage instead of `1d4` damage.

You can upgrade the striking rune already etched on a weapon to a stronger version, increasing the values of the existing rune to those of the new rune. You must have the formula of the stronger rune to do so, and the Price of the upgrade is the difference between the two runes' Prices.
