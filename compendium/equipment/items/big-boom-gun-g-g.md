Developed by a goblin weaponsmith who missed the 'hand' part of 'hand cannon', this comically-oversized gun has a heavily reinforced barrel and is loaded with a worrisome quantity of gunpowder.

This [hand cannon](compendium/equipment/items/hand-cannon-g-g.md) is a martial weapon, instead of a simple weapon. It has the [fatal <d12>](rules/traits/fatal-d12.md "Fatal Weapon Trait") trait and a range of 20 feet. It also has the following modified critical failure condition:

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Failure** The attack misses, the weapon misfires, and you take `1d12` fire damage as it explodes in your face.
