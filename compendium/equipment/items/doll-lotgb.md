### Variants

#### doll *Item 0*

- **Price**: 1 sp

This price is for an average doll of any type.

#### surprise doll *Item 1*

These dolls contain a [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) compartment or pouch capable of holding a single object of up to light Bulk—typically a bell, rattle, or dried flowers.

#### exquisite surprise doll *Item 2*

- **Price**: 10 gp

Hiding an object inside this beautifully crafted surprise doll grants you a +1 item bonus on [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks made to Conceal an Item, as the compartment is particularly well-[hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) and weighted to ensure the doll doesn't feel off-balance with an item inside.
