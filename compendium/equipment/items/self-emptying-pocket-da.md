# Self-Emptying Pocket *Item 9*  
[contract](rules/traits/contract-lol.md "Contract Item Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  


You never perform to an empty crowd after promising any profits to a phantom in a playhouse, sealed by holes that appear in your pockets. By meeting with the attendees at your events, you can use [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) instead of [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) to [Gather Information](rules/actions/gather-information.md). When you would use [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) to [Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md), you don't earn any gold pieces, as the money disappears before you can even count it.

The entity that holds your bargained contract can influence your reception any time you perform for a crowd or Activate the pocket. If they influence your performance favorably, you gain a +2 item bonus to your [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check. If they influence your performance unfavorably, you gain a -2 item penalty to your [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check. If you've failed to earn the entity money in quite a while, it typically influences your performance unfavorably.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, envision

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You exercise all of your charm on a creature, turning a chance meeting into an impromptu performance that commands attention. Attempt a single [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check against the [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC of the creature. On a success, the creature is affected as though by a successful [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check to [Create a Diversion](rules/actions/create-a-diversion.md). The entity that holds your contract can influence this performance as well.
