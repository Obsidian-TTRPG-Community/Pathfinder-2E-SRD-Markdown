### Variants

#### candy constrictor *Item 5*

- **Price**: 140 gp

Although appearing as a multicolored piece of stick candy, this figurine bears a narrow snake head at one end and is as durable as stone. When activated, it becomes a rainbowstriped ball python except it lacks the [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) skill. The snake can be used once per day, and it can remain in snake form for up to 20 minutes.

#### rubber bear *Item 7*

- **Price**: 350 gp

This small, stretchable statuette depicts a bear wearing a tutu and a fez and balancing on a ball slightly larger than its head. When activated, it becomes a grizzly bear with similar attire. The bear remains balanced upon its rubber ball, and is therefore ungainly: it cannot [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md) or [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md), has a â€“10- foot circumstance penalty to its Speed, and is always [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed). If the bear leaves its ball, such as if it is repositioned with forced movement or knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone), it immediately reverts to statuette form. The bear can be used once per day, and it can remain in bear form for up to 1 hour.
