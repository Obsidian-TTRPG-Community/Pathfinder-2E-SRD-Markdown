# Thieves' Tools *Item 0*  

- **Price** 3 gp
- **Bulk** L
- **Hands** 1 or 2*

You need thieves' tools to [Pick Locks](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md) or [Disable Devices](rules/actions/disable-a-device.md) (of some types) using the [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) skill. If your thieves' tools are broken, you can repair them by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks appropriate to your tools; this doesn't require using the [Repair](rules/actions/repair.md) action. If you wear your thieves' tools, you can draw and replace them as part of the action that uses them.

> [!pf2-note]
> You can use the set of tools with one hand if you are wearing it.

### Variants

#### Base *Item 0*


#### Infiltrator *Item 3*

- **Price**: 50 gp

Infiltrator thieves' tools add a +1 item bonus to checks to [Pick Locks](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md) and [Disable Devices](rules/actions/disable-a-device.md).

#### Concealable *Item 4*

- **Price**: 80 gp

Smaller and made of stronger materials than most sets of thieves' tools, the items in this kit are much easier to conceal. You gain a +1 item bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks to [Conceal](rules/actions/conceal-an-object.md) these tools. They otherwise function as infiltrator thieves' tools.
