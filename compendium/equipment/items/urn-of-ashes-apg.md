# Urn Of Ashes *Item 9*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Price** 700 gp
- **Usage** held in 1 hand

This sealed pewter urn contains the ashes of a benevolent ancestor, with a sliver of lingering spirit that strives to protect you.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") envision

- **Trigger**: You would become [doomed](rules/conditions.md#Doomed) or your [doomed](rules/conditions.md#Doomed) value would increase
- **Requirements**: The ashes aren't [doomed](rules/conditions.md#Doomed)

**Effect** The ashes in the urn intervene, taking the [doomed](rules/conditions.md#Doomed) condition in your place, and you don't gain or increase the value of your own [doomed](rules/conditions.md#Doomed) condition. Each night when you get a full night's rest, you can reduce your own [doomed](rules/conditions.md#Doomed) condition or that of the urn, but not both.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") envision, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) ([attack](rules/traits/attack.md))

- **Frequency**: once per round

**Effect** The urn shoots a bolt of negative energy at a foe within 30 feet. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's AC, using a modifier of +15 or your own spell attack roll modifier, whichever is higher. On a success, the bolt deals `4d4` negative damage (doubled on a critical success).
