# Flurrying *Item 7*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 360 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a melee weapon with the [monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait") trait

When you make a [Flurry of Blows](rules/actions/flurry-of-blows.md) using the etched weapon and your first [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) reduces a creature to 0 Hit Points, you can make your second [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with an echo of the weapon, increasing the reach to 30 feet.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, envision ([evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md), [force](rules/traits/force.md))

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** The weapon casts a [spiritual weapon](compendium/spells/spiritual-weapon.md) spell.

The ghostly weapon looks like the etched weapon. Use your normal attack bonus and damage for the weapon instead of the damage listed in the spell, but use your Wisdom modifier instead of Strength when determining damage. You can choose to make a [Flurry of Blows](rules/actions/flurry-of-blows.md) instead of a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) when the spiritual weapon attacks; this still counts as your flourish for the turn.

You can Sustain this activation in the same manner as the spell.
