When activated, it causes the ammunition fired from the affixed weapon to transform into your choice of acid, cold, electricity, or fire, dealing damage of the appropriate energy type instead of its usual damage as well as `1d6` [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) of the same type on a critical hit.
