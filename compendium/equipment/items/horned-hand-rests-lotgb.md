- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** worn

These thick bull or ram horns fuse into the armrests of your legchair companion, giving it more aggressive options. Your animal companion can only invest this item if it is a legchair.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [V](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Varies") envision

- **Frequency**: once per minute

**Effect** You trace your finger along the base of the ram horns, with an effect depending on how many actions you spent.

- **[>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action").** Your legchair draws force from its momentum. Until the end of this turn, if your legchair Strides, it deals `2d6` additional force damage on its next [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) and, on a critical success, pushes the target away by 5 feet.
- **[>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action").** Your legchair fires a beam of force from its ram horns. The target takes `4d6` force damage and must attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save.  
  
    > [!success-degree]   
    > - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
    > - **Success** The target takes half damage and is pushed 5 feet.  
    > - **Failure** The target takes full damage and is pushed 10 feet.  
    > - **Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is pushed 20 feet.
