This +1 striking longsword has a mirror-like blade free of tarnish despite being millennia old. While wielding it, you gain a +2 item bonus to checks to [Aid](rules/actions/aid.md). If you're an expert with the skill or attack roll you're using to [Aid](rules/actions/aid.md) and you critically succeed, you grant your ally a +3 circumstance bonus to the triggering check instead of a +2 bonus.
