The ankylostar grows and transforms into a +2 greater striking greatclub, but it retains the versatile (piercing) trait of a morningstar.

While in this form, the ankylostar has Bulk 2 and requires two hands to wield. It can be returned to its morningstar form with another 1-action command.

- **Requirements**: The ankylostar is in its greatclub form

**Effect** The ankylostar's length extends as you swing the club in a wide arc. You [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) up to three creatures in a 15-foot cone; this counts as one attack for the purpose of calculating your multiple attack penalty. Alternatively, you [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) up to three creatures in a 15-foot cone, rolling a separate [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check for each creature.
