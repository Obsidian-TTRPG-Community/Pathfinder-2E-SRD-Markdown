# Portable Gaming Hall *Item 8*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [structure](rules/traits/structure.md "Structure General Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 500 gp
- **Bulk** L (when not activated)

A portable gaming hall resembles a miniature roulette wheel, except it's marked with indecipherable runes, not numbers.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [⏲](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency") 1 minute ((1 minute)) command, envision, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


The wheel grows into a circular room 30 feet in diameter, with a door on one side. Six chairs surround a circular table, 10 feet in diameter. The underside of the table contains retractable drawers full of dice, harrow cards, game pieces, and other gambling accouterments. A gallon of ale or a similar drink with a spigot near the bottom hangs on the door, replenishing to a full gallon each day; you can also bring in your own drinks if you require more than the gaming hall provides.

You can flip the central table over as a 3-action activity, which has the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") trait, to revert the gaming hall to its original form.
