- **Price** 250 gp

- **Category** Armor

Those favored by [Asmodeus](compendium/setting/deities/asmodeus.md) can be found wearing this +1 studded leather, which is lacquered in red and black.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md)  

- **Trigger**: You critically fail an attack roll, check, or saving throw

**Effect** You offer a prayer to [Asmodeus](compendium/setting/deities/asmodeus.md), who accepts under a reciprocal condition. Reroll the triggering roll with a +2 circumstance bonus and use the higher result.

If this reroll improves your degree of success, the GM can later reroll one [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against you, one saving throw against your abilities, or one secret check or saving throw you make. This is a [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md) effect if used on a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or save against you, or a [misfortune](rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect if used on your secret check or saving throw. The GM must use this reroll before the end of the last day you activated the armor.
