Made of overlapping, lustrous black scales of standard-grade adamantine, this +2 greater resilient fortification adamantine scale mail seems to momentarily thicken at the point of impact when hit. Whenever the armor's fortification rune successfully turns a significant foe's critical hit into a normal hit, one of the scales on the armor turns violet. You gain resistance to physical damage equal to the number of violet scales, to a maximum of 8.

At dawn each day, all the violet scales return to normal.
