# Impenetrable Scale *Item 17*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 12800 gp
- **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include 1,600 gp of adamantine.
- **Bulk** 3; **Usage** worn armor

Made of overlapping, lustrous black scales of standard-grade adamantine, this +2 greater resilient fortification adamantine scale mail seems to momentarily thicken at the point of impact when hit. Whenever the armor's fortification rune successfully turns a significant foe's critical hit into a normal hit, one of the scales on the armor turns violet. You gain resistance to physical damage equal to the number of violet scales, to a maximum of 8.

At dawn each day, all the violet scales return to normal.
