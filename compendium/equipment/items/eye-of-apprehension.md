# Eye of Apprehension *Item 12*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md)  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md)  [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md)  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md)  

- **Price** 400 gp
- **Usage** affixed to armor; **Bulk** â€”
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You are about to roll [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) for initiative but haven't rolled yet; **Requirements** You are a master in [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception).
- **Category** Talisman

This round piece of cymophane's silky inclusion makes it look like a cat's eye. While affixed, it makes you jittery. When you activate it, roll [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) twice and use the higher result.
