Focus briefly calms your neurons, helping ease [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effects.

When you drink this elixir, the elixir attempts a counteract check with the listed counteract modifier to remove the [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused) or [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) condition from a single source, using the source of that condition to determine the counteract level and DC.
