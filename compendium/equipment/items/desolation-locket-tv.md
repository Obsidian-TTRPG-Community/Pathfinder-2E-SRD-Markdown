The surface of this golden, heart-shaped locket is nearly worn through with cracks. If opened, it reveals a portrait of someone the bearer loved dearly and has lost. The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 24.

- Armor The desolation locket numbs you to further despair, and you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effects.
- Weapon (emotion, mental) After you cast an enchantment spell by activating the locket, you emanate an aura of hopelessness in a 5-foot emanation until the start of your next turn. A creature that ends its turn in the aura must succeed at a Will saving throw against the locket's spell DC or become [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) ([slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) on a critical failure) until the end of its next turn.
