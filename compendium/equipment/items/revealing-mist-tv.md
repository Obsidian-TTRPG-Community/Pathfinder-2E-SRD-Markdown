Kept in an airtight spray bottle, revealing mist is an alchemical concoction that creates a sticky and clinging mist of chemicals in a 15-foot cone when sprayed. It doesn't affect visibility but causes [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creatures in the area to be [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) rather than [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected). Revealing mist is ineffective in water or in areas with other factors affecting the spread of the mist, as determined by the GM. It remains in the area for 1 minute or until any significant wind disperses it, whichever comes first.
