Wiry designs mark the silvery coating on a garrote shot. When the activated ammunition hits a target, it transforms into a silvery garrote that wraps around one of the target's appendages, dealing `2d12` [persistent slashing damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). On a critical hit, it wraps around the target's throat if it has one, and the target can't breathe until the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) ends. If the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) kills the target, the garrote severs the appendage it's wrapped around.
