When you push the left-hand button, the inspiring spotlight emits a beam of bright magical light in a 120-foot line that hangs in the air and remains in place even if you move the spotlight. If the line passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, the inspiring spotlight attempts to counteract the darkness. Creatures within the line gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, creatures in the line who are [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) reduce the value of their [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition by 1 at the beginning of each turn they start in the area of the line. The beam remains in place for 1 minute or until you push the righthand button with another [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to extinguish the light.
