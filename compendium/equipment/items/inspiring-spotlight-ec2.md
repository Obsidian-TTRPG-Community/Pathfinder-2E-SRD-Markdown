# Inspiring Spotlight *Item 9*  
[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 650 gp

An inspiring spotlight is a bulky contraption consisting of a drum-shaped metal housing around several reflective metal plates. Two handles on either side, each with a small button, allow you to aim the spotlight outward from your body.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** When you push the left-hand button, the inspiring spotlight emits a beam of bright magical light in a 120-foot line that hangs in the air and remains in place even if you move the spotlight. If the line passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, the inspiring spotlight attempts to counteract the darkness. Creatures within the line gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, creatures in the line who are [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) reduce the value of their [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition by 1 at the beginning of each turn they start in the area of the line. The beam remains in place for 1 minute or until you push the righthand button with another [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to extinguish the light.
