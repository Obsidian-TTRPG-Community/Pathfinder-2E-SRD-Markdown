This talisman is the magically treated corpse of a tiny bat bound in papyrus. When you activate the bat, the affixed weapon detects vibrations around you and guides your perception. You gain the benefits of the fighter Blind-Fight class feat (page 149) for 1 minute.

If you have the Blind-Fight feat, you gain imprecise echolocation with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. This makes creatures that would be [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by you because you can't see them [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) instead.
