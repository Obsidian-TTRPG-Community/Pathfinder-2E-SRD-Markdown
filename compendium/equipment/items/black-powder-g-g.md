Black powder is a volatile and explosive alchemical substance commonly used in the production of firearm munitions.

Black powder becomes inert and useless when wet and must be kept in a sealed, water-tight container.

### Variants

#### dose or round *Item 0*

- **Price**: 1 cp

The smallest unit of black powder that still has a simple use, a dose can be a simple package paper parcel around black powder or it can be packaged with a metal bullet or pellet to be used as ammunition. When ignited with a fuse or exposed to direct flame, a dose of black powder explodes. This isn't powerful enough to deal damage but makes a loud sound and could trigger further explosions. A fuse for a dose can be created with a few twists of paper and causes the dose to explode the round after it's lit.

#### horn *Item 2*

- **Price**: 5 gp

A horn contains 500 doses worth of black powder. A horn can be detonated by leaving a small trail of black powder and then lighting it. Each 5-foot square requires one dose of black powder to create a trail through. As long as the horn is mostly full (at least 400 doses remaining) it can be detonated to deal `1d6` fire damage in a 5-foot burst (DC 16 basic Reflex save). It takes 1 round per 15 feet of powder trail laid down for a horn to detonate after the trail is lit. If multiple horns detonate simultaneously, it can increase the area of the explosion, but the damage in overlapping areas doesn't increase.

#### keg *Item 6*

- **Price**: 50 gp

A keg contains 5,000 doses of black powder and can be detonated in the same way as a horn. As long as the keg is mostly full (at least 4,000 doses remaining) this deals `3d6` fire damage in a 20-foot burst (DC 20 basic Reflex save). Detonating multiple kegs can increase the area, but not the damage, of this effect; detonating a keg and any horns at the same time in an overlapping area also doesn't increase the damage.
