This +1 striking flintlock musketG&G features multiple triangular panels that can be folded out of the stock, like the petals of a tigridia flower, that collect sunlight and feed it into the spark gun's core. All damage dealt by a solar shellflower is fire damage.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

One of the panels from the solar shellflower detaches and unfurls into a tigridia-shaped construct of flame. For the next 1 minute, whenever you [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) an enemy with the solar shellflower, the construct fires a smaller jet of fire that automatically hits the target, dealing `3d4` additional [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) or twice that on a critical hit. The solar shellflower usually requires a full day to replenish enough solar energy to recharge this Activation, but if used in an environment with especially strong sunlight, such as in a desert, cliff above the clouds, or near the summer solstice, it can recharge in 1 hour instead.
