# Anchor of Aquatic Exploration *Item 9*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 690 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

No matter how often it's washed, the last crystals of salt rime never quite leave this pitted anchor. When you're holding the anchor of aquatic exploration, you can breathe underwater; however, you can't [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md), losing any [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) speed you have, automatically failing any [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md), and so on. Instead, when you enter a body of water, you sink to the bottom at a rate of 25 feet per round and can move across the bottom at your normal Speed. You're protected from [environmental](rules/traits/environmental.md "Environmental Hazard Trait") effects of deep water such as pressure, cold temperatures, and any negative consequences of depressurization.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [‚è≤](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency") 1 minute [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Requirements**: You're underwater

**Effect** You spend one minute digging the anchor into the seabed, after which the anchor casts a [cozy cabin](compendium/spells/cozy-cabin-apg.md) spell, summoning a sunken ship instead of a cabin. The sunken ship is filled with breathable air.
