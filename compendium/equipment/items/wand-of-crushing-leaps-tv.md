This supple, light wooden wand drifts to the ground like a feather or leaf when dropped, landing unharmed. A thin coil of metal wraps around the wand's handle.

title: Activate

You cast [jump](compendium/spells/jump.md), but can jump up to 60 feet. When you land you shatter the ground, making each creature in a 5-foot emanation [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of its next turn.

In addition, the space you land in and all squares in the emanation become difficult terrain for 1 minute.
