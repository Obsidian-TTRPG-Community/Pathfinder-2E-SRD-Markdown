# Wand of Crushing Leaps *Item 4*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [wand](rules/traits/wand.md "Wand Item Trait")  

- **Price** 80 gp
- **Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of 1st-level [jump](compendium/spells/jump.md).
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This supple, light wooden wand drifts to the ground like a feather or leaf when dropped, landing unharmed. A thin coil of metal wraps around the wand's handle.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day, plus overcharge

**Effect** You cast [jump](compendium/spells/jump.md), but can jump up to 60 feet. When you land you shatter the ground, making each creature in a 5-foot emanation [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of its next turn.

In addition, the space you land in and all squares in the emanation become difficult terrain for 1 minute.
