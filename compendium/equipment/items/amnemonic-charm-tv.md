- **Price** 140 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You fail or critically fail a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), or [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check to [Coerce](rules/actions/coerce.md), [Lie](rules/actions/lie.md), [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md), or [Request](rules/actions/request.md); **Requirements** You're a master in the skill you failed with.

This ornate locket, usually containing a faceless, humanoid portrait, is typically worn on a chain around the neck or attached to your clothing. When activated, the charm casts a DC 26 [modify memory](compendium/spells/modify-memory.md) spell against a single target of the check, removing all memory of your failed attempt and potentially allowing you to make another attempt. The effect can't remove more than 3 minutes of memories from its target.
