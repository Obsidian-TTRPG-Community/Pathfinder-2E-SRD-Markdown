The weapon can harm creatures without physical form. A [ghost touch](compendium/equipment/items/ghost-touch.md) weapon is particularly effective against incorporeal creatures, which almost always have a specific weakness to [ghost touch](compendium/equipment/items/ghost-touch.md) weapons. Incorporeal creatures can touch, hold, and wield [ghost touch](compendium/equipment/items/ghost-touch.md) weapons (unlike most physical objects).
