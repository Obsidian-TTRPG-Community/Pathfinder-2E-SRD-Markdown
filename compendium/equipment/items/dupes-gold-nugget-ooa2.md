# Dupe's Gold Nugget *Item 5*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 30 gp
- **Bulk** —; **Usage** affixed to a ranged weapon
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You hit with a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the affixed weapon; **Requirements** You're an expert with the affixed weapon.

This nugget of gold and lead amalgam is attached to the weapon by thick, twisted wire or chain. When activated, the target's limbs become like lead weights. For 2 rounds, each time the target Strides it must attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save. On a failure, it takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed for that [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) (to a minimum Speed of 5 feet). On a critical success, the dupe's gold nugget effect ends early.
