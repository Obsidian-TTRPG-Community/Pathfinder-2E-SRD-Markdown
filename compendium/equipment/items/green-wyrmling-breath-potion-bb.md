This liquid contains blood from a wyrmling green dragon. For 1 hour after you drink it, you can unleash a cloud of poison as a breath weapon. Exhaling dragon breath uses a single action. The breath weapon deals `2d6` poison damage in a 15-foot cone, and each creature in the area must attempt a DC 23 basic Fortitude save. After you use the breath weapon, you can't do so again for `1d4` rounds.
