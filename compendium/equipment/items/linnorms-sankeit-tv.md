# Linnorm's Sankeit *Item 18*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 22750 gp
- **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the hide and skull of a taiga linnorm (Bestiary 2 164).
- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** worn armor

The first suit of +3 greater resilient antimagic sankeit made in this fashion was crafted for the Varki linnorm king Nankou, after he claimed his title by slaying a taiga linnorm. By Varki tradition, the armor was crafted using some of the slain linnorm's body to decorate the breastplate and helm, which imbued the armor with several of the linnorm's natural abilities. Though the helm is shaped like the beast's head, a linnorm's actual head would be too large for a proper helmet.

title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** You breathe a 60-foot cone of electrified vapor, dealing `17d6` electricity damage to creatures in the area (DC 38 basic Reflex save). The electrified mist persists in the area for 2 rounds, dealing `5d6` electricity damage (DC 38 basic Reflex save) to each creature that ends its turn in the mist. If you slew the linnorm this armor is made from, you can use the higher of your class DC or spell DC instead of the listed DCs for this effect.

- **Trigger**: A creature adjacent to you targets you with a melee attack

**Effect** The creature takes `4d6` piercing damage as previously [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) magical spines leap outwards from the armor to punish them for the attack.
