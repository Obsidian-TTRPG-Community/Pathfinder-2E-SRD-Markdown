[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 150 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a weapon

This rune turns weapons into instruments of peacemaking.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") command ([mental](rules/traits/mental.md))

- **Trigger**: You damage a creature with the etched weapon

**Effect** The damaged creature must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be pacified. A pacified creature takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls on any attacks that aren't nonlethal for 1 minute, and the creature also experiences a clear psychic warning that they should stop making attacks that could kill.
