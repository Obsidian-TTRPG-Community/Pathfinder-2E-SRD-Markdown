[apex](rules/traits/apex.md "Apex Item Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 15000 gp

This elegant silver band often resembles curling fig leaves and fits around your brow. You gain a +2 item bonus to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) and [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks.

When you invest the circlet, you either increase your Charisma score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
