A spirited debate persists among scholars on whether the eponymous tyrant of this grimoire actually refers to Tar-Baphon, the necromancer Geb, or even the goddess [Urgathoa](compendium/setting/deities/urgathoa.md) herself. This grimoire appears at first to be a series of writs that makes arrogant demands of the reader, those around them, and the universe. Anyone who gives these writings more than a cursory look realizes the writs hold spells much like any other grimoire, with the [animate dead](compendium/spells/animate-dead-apg.md) spell being particularly prominent. Tyrant's writs grants you the ability to demand more from the undead you animate.

If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) to cast an [animate dead](compendium/spells/animate-dead-apg.md) spell prepared with tyrant's writs, you can choose one of the following additional benefits to grant the summoned undead.

- Bloody The undead gains fast healing equal to its level.
- Explosive When it reaches 0 Hit Points, the undead explodes, dealing `4d6` fire damage to adjacent creatures, with a basic Reflex save using the [animate dead](compendium/spells/animate-dead-apg.md) spell's DC. As normal, since the [final sacrifice](compendium/spells/final-sacrifice-apg.md) spell doesn't reduce the target to 0 Hit Points, it doesn't cause this explosion.
- Necrotic Speed The undead gains a +10-foot status bonus to all its Speeds.
- Rotten Any living creature who starts its turn adjacent to the undead who isn't at full Hit Points takes `1d6` poison damage.
