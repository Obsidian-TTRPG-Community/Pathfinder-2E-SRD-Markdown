# Bullhook *Item 3+*  
[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

A bullhook is a stout rod about 4 feet long with a blunt hook on the end. Too dull to be useful as a weapon, a bullhook is instead used to direct animals in training or in performing their tasks. A bullhook grants you an item bonus to [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature) checks to [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) while you are holding it.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You wave the bullhook to produce the effects of a [command](compendium/spells/command.md) spell. This spell loses the [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait") trait and can target only animals.
