# Hex Blaster *Item 11*  
[curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait")  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")  [unique](rules/traits/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 1400 gp
- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** held in 2 hands

This +2 striking fearsome arquebus (Advanced Players Guide 260, Guns & Gears 152) is composed of warped and twisted wood engraved with eerie runes. When the weapon fires, the blast sometimes sounds like the cackling of a diabolical witch.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") command

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You afflict a creature you can see with a hex of impending doom. The hex lasts for 1 minute. As long as the creature is hexed, when you hit it with a round from the hex blaster, the creature must attempt a DC 28 Will save at the end of your turn; the creature attempts a single Will save regardless of the number of times you hit it.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened). It also takes `1d6` [persistent mental damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Failure** The creature is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened). It also takes `2d6` [persistent mental damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) and [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 minute. It also takes `4d6` [persistent mental damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is cursed with a hex of impending doom. If the target falls [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) from damage dealt by this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or the [persistent mental damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), it remains [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) for 1 day or until this curse is removed. After 1 day, if the creature is still [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), it must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or die; this effect has the [death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait") and [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait") traits.
