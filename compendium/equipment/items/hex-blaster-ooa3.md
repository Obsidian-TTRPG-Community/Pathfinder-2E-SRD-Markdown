This +2 striking fearsome arquebus (Advanced Players Guide 260, Guns & Gears 152) is composed of warped and twisted wood engraved with eerie runes. When the weapon fires, the blast sometimes sounds like the cackling of a diabolical witch.

You afflict a creature you can see with a hex of impending doom. The hex lasts for 1 minute. As long as the creature is hexed, when you hit it with a round from the hex blaster, the creature must attempt a DC 28 Will save at the end of your turn; the creature attempts a single Will save regardless of the number of times you hit it.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened). It also takes `1d6` [persistent mental damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Failure** The creature is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened). It also takes `2d6` [persistent mental damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) and [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 minute. It also takes `4d6` [persistent mental damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is cursed with a hex of impending doom. If the target falls [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) from damage dealt by this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or the [persistent mental damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), it remains [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) for 1 day or until this curse is removed. After 1 day, if the creature is still [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), it must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or die; this effect has the [death](rules/traits/death.md) and [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md) traits.
