- **Usage** curses a weapon

A weapon with the _backbiting_ curse warps space in response to catastrophic mishaps. Whenever you critically fail at a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with this weapon, the weapon curls around (or its projectile swerves through the air) to strike you in the back as though you hit yourself, automatically dealing maximum damage to you.
