This circular hoop has blades along its outer edge. You can wield it in two hands (using the two-hand damage) or by spinning it around an arm. While you spin the hoop, it gains the free-hand trait. Setting the hoop spinning takes 1 Interact action. In addition to the normal restrictions of the free-hand trait, extended use of the arm for locomotion (such as to Climb) interferes with the hoop's spinning and forces you to Release the hoop. You can't spin a hoop underwater. Keeping the hoop spinning requires a free action each round, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits. You can keep a hoop spinning as an exploration activity, but doing so for more than 10 minutes makes you fatigued, similarly to Hustling.
