# Follypops *Item 10*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

These savory breaded snacks stuffed with cheese, peppers, and "secret ingredients" of draconic or demonic origin are often offered alongside a challenge—complete a full portion and get a free drink. For 1 hour after consuming follypops, your stomach gurgles and rumbles with magical potential.

During this time, you can unleash magic in the area up to three times as a single action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait, with an area and damage determined by the type of pop; the third time you use this magic, the effects of your follypops end. All creatures within the area must attempt a DC 27 basic saving throw each time you unleash magic, as noted by the type of pop.

### Variants

#### hotpops *Item 0*


You begin to sweat profusely after consuming the serving. When you unleash magic, you breathe out a blast of fire in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take `4d6` fire damage with the first blast, `2d6` fire damage with the second blast, and `1d6` fire damage with the final blast. The creatures must attempt a basic Reflex save for each blast.

#### rotters *Item 0*


Your breath smells of rotting garbage after you consume the serving. When you unleash magic, you exhale a noxious breath in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take `4d6` poison damage with the first breath, `2d6` poison damage with the second breath, and `1d6` poison damage with the final breath. The creatures must attempt a basic Fortitude save for each breath.

#### sizzlers *Item 0*


Your skin crawls and your hair stands on end after consuming the serving. When you unleash magic, you release a bolt of lightning from your hand that travels in a 30-foot line. The first bolt deals `2d12` electricity damage, the second `1d12` electricity damage, and the third `1d6` electricity damage. The targeted creatures must attempt a basic Reflex save for each bolt.
