- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

This small recording device can be as tiny as a music box or around the size of large book and is typically [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) in hollowed-out books and jewelry. A clockwork recorder can record up to 1 hour of sound before its wax cylinders must be retrieved and replaced.

Any given clockwork recorder can play back the recordings of a cylinder, regardless of whether it was the recorder used for the original recording.
