This heavy metal emblem is mounted on the face of the affixed shield and has a dull gray gemstone embedded at its center. When you Activate the talisman, the gem shatters, releasing a powerful shockwave in a 15-foot cone that must include the enemy who struck the triggering blow, if possible. Each creature in the cone takes `2d6` sonic damage with a DC 28 basic Fortitude save. Any creature that fails its save is pushed 5 feet away from you (or 10 feet on a critical failure).
