# Sovereign Steel Weapon *Item 12+*  
[rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Usage** varies by weapon; **Bulk** varies by weapon
- **Category** Material

Sovereign steel weapons are treated as cold iron against creatures with a weakness to cold iron, like demons and fey. In addition, the noqual in sovereign steel weapons disrupts spellcasters' concentration, causing them to become [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 round on a critical hit.
