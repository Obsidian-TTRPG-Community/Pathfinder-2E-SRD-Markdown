# Skeleton Key *Item 3*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 12 gp

A grinning skull tops the bow of this macabre key. This key can be used in place of [thieves' tools](compendium/equipment/items/thieves-tools.md) when attempting to [Pick a Lock](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md), and it grants a +1 item bonus to the [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check.

If the skeleton key becomes [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) due to a critical failure on the check, it works as normal [thieves' tools](compendium/equipment/items/thieves-tools.md) and loses its benefits until [Repaired](rules/actions/repair.md). Once per day, when you're using the key to Pick a Lock, you can activate the key to magically make the lock easier to overcome. You gain a +4 status bonus to your attempt to Pick the Lock, and for 1 minute, anyone who tries to Pick the Lock or break it with [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) gains a +4 status bonus on their checks.
