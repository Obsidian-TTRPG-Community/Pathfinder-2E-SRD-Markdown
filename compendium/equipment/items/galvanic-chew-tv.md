A galvanic chew is a processed ball of dried electric eel, roasted until chewy and coated in spicy, reagent-infused powder that tingles with electricity as you chew. For up to 1 hour, you have resistance 5 to electricity.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Secondary Effect** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md))

- **Trigger**: You're hit by a melee attack or touched by a creature

**Effect** You channel electricity into the triggering creature, which must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) (or [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) on a critical failure). The chew becomes inert. You're then temporarily immune to galvanic chews for 24 hours or until the next time you make your daily preparations.
