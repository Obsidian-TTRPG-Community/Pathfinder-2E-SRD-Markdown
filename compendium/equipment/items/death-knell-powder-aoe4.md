This poison is made from toxic spores of death knell mushrooms, which are reduced to a gray powder and suffused with necromantic energy. If you're reduced to 0 Hit Points while under the effect of death knell powder, you must succeed at a DC 34 Will save or die (this is a [death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait") effect). If you die, a random creature adjacent to you is bolstered by your departing life force and gains 20 temporary HP and a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls for 10 minutes.
