# Oathbow *Item 11*  
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 1300 gp
- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** held in 1 hand

Constructed of a flexible, white wood and with ornate, twisting designs carved into its surface, this +2 striking composite longbow appears to have been made by elves. Sometimes when you loose an arrow, its whistling in flight sounds like a voice whispering in Elven, wishing for the swift defeat of your enemies.

title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") command


You swear an oath to destroy one creature you can see. For the next 7 days or until that creature is slain, your attacks with the bow against that creature deal `1d6` additional damage, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) checks to [Track](rules/actions/track.md) that creature. Your critical hits against the target gain the bow's critical specialization effect (page 283); if they would already do so, they instead increase the DC of the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) when critically hit to DC 20.

After you activate the bow, you can't activate it again for 7 days. If you kill the creature you've sworn an oath against, the oath ends and you need to wait only 10 minutes before you can activate it again.
