Rendered from the fat of corporeal undead creatures and infused with ghoulish magic, this yellowish oil causes its victims to experience stabbing hunger pangs that only living flesh can abate. If you eat at least a mouthful of humanoid flesh, you ignore the [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition from hunger oil for 1 minute. While under the effect of hunger oil, you regain only half as many Hit Points from [healing](rules/traits/healing.md "Healing Effect Trait") effects unless you've eaten at least a mouthful of humanoid flesh in the last minute.
