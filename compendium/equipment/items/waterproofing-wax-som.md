Many books and spellbooks are treated in this wax formula to protect them from the elements, but waterproofing wax's liquid-repellent properties can be further applied to split up a [grease](compendium/spells/grease.md) spell into useful smaller sections. When the spell is cast in an area while using this catalyst, the conjured grease fills three 5-foot squares within 30 feet instead of its normal area; these squares don't need to be contiguous.
