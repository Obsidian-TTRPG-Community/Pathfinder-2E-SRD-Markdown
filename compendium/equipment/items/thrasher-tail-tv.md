# Thrasher Tail *Item 9*  
[clockwork](rules/traits/clockwork-g-g.md "Clockwork  Trait")  [kobold](rules/traits/kobold-b1.md "Kobold Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 620 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** worn

Kobolds admire well-designed objects, especially if it gives them an opportunity to pack it with traps and surprises. This prosthetic tail hides numerous blades and spikes, tensioned and wound around a spring-loaded trigger at the base of the prosthesis.

Resetting and reattaching a sprung thrasher tail takes 10 minutes.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: You're [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed)

**Effect** Your tail comes off in your opponent's hand, and the mechanism unwinds, causing the blades and spikes to protrude and the tail to spin and thrash. The tail deals `8d6` slashing damage to the opponent who has you [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) with a DC 25 basic Reflex save. Regardless of the result of their save, you're no longer [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed).
