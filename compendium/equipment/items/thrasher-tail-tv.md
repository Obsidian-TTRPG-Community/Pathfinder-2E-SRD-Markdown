Kobolds admire well-designed objects, especially if it gives them an opportunity to pack it with traps and surprises. This prosthetic tail hides numerous blades and spikes, tensioned and wound around a spring-loaded trigger at the base of the prosthesis.

Resetting and reattaching a sprung thrasher tail takes 10 minutes.

- **Trigger**: You're [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed)

**Effect** Your tail comes off in your opponent's hand, and the mechanism unwinds, causing the blades and spikes to protrude and the tail to spin and thrash. The tail deals `8d6` slashing damage to the opponent who has you [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) with a DC 25 basic Reflex save. Regardless of the result of their save, you're no longer [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed).
