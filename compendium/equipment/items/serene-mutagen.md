You gain inner serenity, focused on fine details and steeled against mental assaults, but you find violence off-putting.

**Benefit** You gain an item bonus to Will saves and [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception), [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine), [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion), and [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) checks. This bonus improves when you attempt Will saves against [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effects.

**Drawback** You take a –1 penalty to attack rolls and save DCs of offensive spells, and a –1 penalty per damage die to all weapon, unarmed attack, and spell damage.
