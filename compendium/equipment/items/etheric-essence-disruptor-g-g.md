[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [gadget](rules/traits/gadget-g-g.md "Gadget  Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

An etheric essence disruptor emits bursts of discordant ethereal energy through a process based upon Stasian etheric-spirit singers, though without the need for a Stasian coil. Etheric essence disruptors attempt to break down the workings of a spell that manipulates spiritual essence. Upon activation, attempt to counteract an active [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait") or [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait") spell within the listed range, with the listed counteract modifier and counteract level.
