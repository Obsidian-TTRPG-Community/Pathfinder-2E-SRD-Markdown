# Folding Boat *Item 8+*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This simple carved box can fold or unfold into a boat when activated.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


The folding boat can take two shapes. The first is a wooden box that's 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches high; it weighs 1 Bulk and can store up to 1 Bulk of items. The other form is a rowboat (Gamemastery Guide 179). If the chosen form can't fit in the space, it takes the largest shape that does fit. You can activate the boat again to revert it to its original shape.

If the boat is occupied, the item can't be activated. Much like a magical structure (Core Rulebook 596), a folding boat can't harm creatures when it unfolds and creatures within it are set aside harmlessly when it folds.

Any items that were stored inside the box appear in the boat or ship. Items stored on the boat or ship form that are too large to fit inside the box form are ejected from the vehicle and appear on the ground adjacent to the box.

A folding boat with the [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) condition must be repaired before it can change form again.

### Variants

#### folding boat *Item 8*

- **Price**: 500 gp

#### greater folding boat *Item 15*

- **Price**: 6000 gp

A greater folding boat's alternate form is a cutter, rather than a rowboat, piloted and crewed by ethereal sailors. The ethereal sailors don't prevent you from activating the boat to return it to a box.
