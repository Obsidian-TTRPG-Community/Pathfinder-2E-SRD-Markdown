A gift passed from warrior to warrior, this cowl is made from a cave bear's skull and fur. Once invested, the wearer gains a +1 item bonus to [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature) checks to [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md), which increases to +2 if the animal is a bear. The wearer of the hood feels a constant longing for the wilderness and wild places and takes a –1 item penalty to all [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks to [Gather Information](rules/actions/gather-information.md) or [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) if they go more than 5 days inside a large town or city without spending at least 4 hours in the wilderness.

Destruction Soak the Ursine Avenger Hood in the blood of a linnorm that is at least 16th level and then burn it in a fire that uses only oak and chrysanthemum as fuel.
