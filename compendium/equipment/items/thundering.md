- **Usage** etched onto a weapon

This weapon lets out a peal of thunder when it hits, dealing an extra `1d6` sonic damage on a successful [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). On a critical hit, the target has to succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be [deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 minute (or 1 hour on a critical failure).
