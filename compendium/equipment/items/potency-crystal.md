This fluorite crystal glows with a strange phosphorescence.

When you activate the crystal, the weapon becomes a +1 [striking](compendium/equipment/items/striking.md) weapon for the rest of the turn, gaining a +1 item bonus to the attack roll and increasing the damage on a hit to two weapon damage dice.
