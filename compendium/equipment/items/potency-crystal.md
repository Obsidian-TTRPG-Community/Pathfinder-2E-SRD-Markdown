- **Price** 4 gp

- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You make an attack with the affixed weapon, but you haven't rolled yet.

This fluorite crystal glows with a strange phosphorescence.

When you activate the crystal, the weapon becomes a +1 [striking](compendium/equipment/items/striking.md) weapon for the rest of the turn, gaining a +1 item bonus to the attack roll and increasing the damage on a hit to two weapon damage dice.
