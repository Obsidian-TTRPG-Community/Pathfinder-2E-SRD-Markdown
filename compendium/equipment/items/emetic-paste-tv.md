# Emetic Paste *Item 2+*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [healing](rules/traits/healing.md "Healing Effect Trait")  

- **Price** 5 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

[Sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) creatures have difficulty swallowing, so you can Activate emetic paste by applying it to your skin or that of a [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) creature within reach, typically on the throat. The paste makes it easy for the [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) creature to purge, granting it an immediate Fortitude save to reduce its [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition. The paste grants the target an item bonus to that save and to all saving throws to reduce the [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition for 1 hour.
