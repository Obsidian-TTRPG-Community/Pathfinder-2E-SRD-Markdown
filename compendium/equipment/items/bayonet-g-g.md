This blade or spike can be attached to a crossbow or firearm but, unlike other attached weapons, can be wielded in one hand as its own weapon. When used as a separate weapon, it can't benefit from any runes or abilities that function only for attached weapons.

> [!pf2-note]
> An attached bayonet or reinforced stock requires the same number of hands as the weapon it's attached to. A detached bayonet requires one hand.
