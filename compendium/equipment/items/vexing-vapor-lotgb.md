This flask contains a fine red powder made from toxic berries. A vexing vapor bomb deals the listed mental damage and mental splash damage. On a hit, the target must succeed at a DC 5 flat check before taking actions with the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait. This lasts until the end of its next turn (1 minute on a critical hit).
