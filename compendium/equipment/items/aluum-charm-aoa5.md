# Aluum Charm *Item 10*  
[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** â€“; **Usage** worn

This ornate pendant of brass is adorned with a vibrant blue gemstone. An _aluum charm_ grants control over a particular aluum and lesser influence over other such constructs. As long as you wear an aluum's linked _aluum charm_, that aluum follows your verbal commands, including somewhat nuanced orders like "subdue this target" or "strike anyone wearing a blue robe."

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command

- **Frequency**: once per round

**Effect** The charm grants you control over an aluum you can see within 60 feet, with a level equal to or lower than the charm. This has the effect of [dominate](compendium/spells/dominate.md) and allows a DC 28 Will save. If the aluum is currently under the control of someone wearing its linked charm, it gets a result on its saving throw one degree higher than what it rolled. You can control only one aluum at a time using this activation, and controlling a new aluum ends the effect for one you had previously affected.
