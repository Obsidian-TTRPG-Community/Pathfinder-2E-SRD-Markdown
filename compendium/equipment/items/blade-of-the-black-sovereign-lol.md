# Blade Of The Black Sovereign *Item 15*  
[electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [unique](rules/traits/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 6500 gp
- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** held in 2 hands

This +2 greater striking shock greatsword is forged from standard-grade adamantine, with inlays of [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) circuitry and a robot's ocular lens on the cross guard. A soft thrum comes from the blade, which you feel as a subtle pulse through the grip when wielding it.

It sparks when unsheathed, emitting dim light within 5 feet. On a hit against a foe made of metal, wearing metal armor, or using a metal shield, if the foe takes electricity damage from the blade, the makes the foe [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) for 1 round; if the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) was a critical hit, it also makes them [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 round.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You cast the [electric arc](compendium/spells/electric-arc.md) cantrip from the sword as an 8th-level primal spell, using 10 + your melee attack modifier with the Blade of the Black Sovereign as your spell DC.
