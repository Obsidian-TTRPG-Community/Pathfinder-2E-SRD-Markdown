Quenching potion is a clear liquid that tastes like fresh, cool spring water. Drinking this potion or pouring it over yourself completely hydrates you and cleanses your system. Immediately attempt a flat check to end any [persistent acid](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), fire, negative, or poison damage affecting you, and attempt a new saving throw against any poison affecting you. Poison can't progress to a worse stage due to this saving throw.

The potion counts as a particularly appropriate type of help against [persistent acid](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), fire, negative, and poison damage.
