Patterns themed to your curse cover your oracular crown. As your curse worsens, the appearance of the crown changes, introducing extreme angles, stronger colors, or other indications of the intensity of your curse. Similarly, it gets closer to its natural form when you reduce the effects of your curse. You gain a +2 item bonus to [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) checks.

You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can use only to cast an oracle revelation spell. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.

- **Requirements**: Your oracular curse is at its minor stage or higher

**Effect** You regain `3d8` Hit Points. This amount increases to `5d8` if your curse is at its moderate stage or `7d8` if it's at its major stage. If you have negative healing, this activation has the [negative](rules/traits/negative.md) trait and not the [healing](rules/traits/healing.md) and [positive](rules/traits/positive.md) traits.
