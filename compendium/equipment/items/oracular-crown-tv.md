# Oracular Crown *Item 11*  
[divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [focused](rules/traits/focused.md "Focused Item Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Price** 1200 gp
- **Craft Requirements** You are an oracle.
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn headwear

Patterns themed to your curse cover your oracular crown. As your curse worsens, the appearance of the crown changes, introducing extreme angles, stronger colors, or other indications of the intensity of your curse. Similarly, it gets closer to its natural form when you reduce the effects of your curse. You gain a +2 item bonus to [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") envision

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can use only to cast an oracle revelation spell. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") command ([healing](rules/traits/healing.md), [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md), [positive](rules/traits/positive.md))

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Requirements**: Your oracular curse is at its minor stage or higher

**Effect** You regain `3d8` Hit Points. This amount increases to `5d8` if your curse is at its moderate stage or `7d8` if it's at its major stage. If you have negative healing, this activation has the [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait") trait and not the [healing](rules/traits/healing.md "Healing Effect Trait") and [positive](rules/traits/positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait") traits.
