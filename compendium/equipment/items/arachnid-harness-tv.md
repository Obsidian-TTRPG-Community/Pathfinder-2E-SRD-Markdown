- **Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Armor

This +1 leather armor has four knobbed ribs that wrap around the torso. The armor grants you resistance 2 to poison damage.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

The ribs from the armor spread into functional spider limbs. For 1 minute, you gain a climb Speed equal to half your land Speed and have your limbs free as you climb. If you use all your free limbs to help you [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md), your climb Speed equals your land Speed.
