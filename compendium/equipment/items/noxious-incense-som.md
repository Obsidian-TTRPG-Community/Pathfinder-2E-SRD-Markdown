Sold only in single sticks, this foul incense comes coated with a bevy of alchemical smoke that activates in the presence of intense heat, releasing its namesake pungent odor. Adding this catalyst to a [wall of fire](compendium/spells/wall-of-fire.md) spell fills all squares adjacent to the wall with thick, foul smoke. Creatures in this area are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed), and other creatures are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to creatures in the area. The smoke lasts for the duration of the spell.
