# Exsanguinating Ammunition *Item 4+*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  

- **Ammunition** any
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

This ammunition includes a small reservoir of a tacky red substance that coats the ammunition when you activate it. The substance makes a creature bleed more freely. For 1 minute after you deal damage to a creature with an activated exsanguinating ammunition that creature gains the listed weakness to [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). In addition, the DC of any flat checks to end [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases from 15 to 17 (from 10 to 12 when receiving particularly effective assistance) for the duration.
