This large brass medallion hangs low on the torso. It's shaped in the form of an unblinking eye, with a ring of turquoise as the iris and an orb of jet serving as the pupil. The amulet grants you a +2 item bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks. When you invest the amulet, you either increase your Wisdom score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.
