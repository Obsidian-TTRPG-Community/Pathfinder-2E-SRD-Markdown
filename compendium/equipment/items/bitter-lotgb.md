- **Price** 135 gp
- **Usage** etched onto armor

While you wear this acrid armor, any creature that Engulfs you or Swallows you Whole is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened); if it spends an action retching to reduce the [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition, you can attempt to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) as a reaction.
