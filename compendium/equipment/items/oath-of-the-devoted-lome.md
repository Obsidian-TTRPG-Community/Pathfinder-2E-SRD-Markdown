You gain fire and mental resistance 5.

When you die, you rise as an undead creature with the [zombie](rules/traits/zombie-b1.md "Zombie Creature Trait") trait on the next round; if you are a PC, you become an NPC under Walkena's control. Your stats remain the same, except that your alignment changes to evil. If you reach 0 Hit Points as a zombie, you are destroyed and do not rise again.
