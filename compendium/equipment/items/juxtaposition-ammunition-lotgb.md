# Juxtaposition Ammunition *Item 11*

- **Price** 225 gp
- **Ammunition** any
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

Juxtaposition ammunition quivers with anticipation, as if the projectile wishes to constantly be in motion. When an activated juxtaposition ammunition hits a creature, it doesn't deal the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)'s normal damage. Instead, the target must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be teleported to a safe, unoccupied square of your choice within 60 feet of its original position and within the weapon's first range increment. On a critical failure, the target is also [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) from the gut-wrenching sensation of sudden movement. Any relocation from the juxtaposition ammunition is forced movement.
