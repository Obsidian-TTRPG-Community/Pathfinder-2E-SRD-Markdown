Stitched together from pieces of ghoul skin, this suit of +1 hide armor grants you a +1 item bonus to saving throws against disease and paralysis and makes you immune to the paralysis of ghouls. Ghoul hide with a resilient rune increases the resilient rune's item bonus to saving throws against disease and paralysis by 1 (maximum +4)

Ghoul hide hisses with sibilant hatred at the touch of elves. When worn by a creature with the [elf](rules/traits/elf.md) trait, the armor gains the [noisy](rules/traits/noisy.md) trait.
