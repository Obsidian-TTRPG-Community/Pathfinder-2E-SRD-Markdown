These well-aged wooden magnifying glasses are engraved with a variety of runes. Each is imbued with a specific language.

When you use a magnifying glass to examine writing of its imbued language, it translates the writing into a language Urban Garden Wares you understand. For example, an elf who speaks only Elven using a magnifying glass of elucidation imbued with Dwarven would see Dwarven writing as Elven when [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed) through the magnifying glass. The magnifying glass only provides direct translations and doesn't automatically allow you to understand codes or extremely esoteric passagesâ€”you still need to attempt a skill check to [Decipher Writing](rules/actions/decipher-writing.md).

title: Activate [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")

You can use a separate 3-action activity to have the magnifying glass reproduce the imbued information onto blank paper exactly as it appeared when you Activated the magnifying glass. The reproduction is a direct copy of the pages but doesn't imbue the reproduction with any [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") effects or other special effects.

The magnifying glass can only hold one instance of information at a given time; [Activating](rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) the magnifying glass a second time or reproducing the information clears out the magnifying glass's information.
