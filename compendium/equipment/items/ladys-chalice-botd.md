# Lady's Chalice *Item 3*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [good](rules/traits/good.md "Good Alignment Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 60 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This silver chalice bears the symbol of [Pharasma](compendium/setting/deities/pharasma.md), a swirling cloud that transforms into a flight of whippoorwills that encircle the top. The chalice can be activated in one of two ways, though only once per day total.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") envision

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** The chalice fills with a single vial's worth of holy water. The water loses its potency after 1 day if poured into any container other than a font specifically sanctified by a cleric of [Pharasma](compendium/setting/deities/pharasma.md). It similarly loses its potency 1 day after being removed from such a font.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Requirements**: The Lady's chalice is full of a vial's worth of holy water

**Effect** The chalice splashes a spiral of holy water into an adjacent space. This is a simple thrown weapon with a range of 5 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") trait to the attack made with it. If it hits, it deals `2d6` good damage and 2 good [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage (including to you, if you're evil).
