# Snapleaf *Item 3*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 9 gp
- **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md); **Trigger** You begin to fall.

This small, crystalline carving takes the shape of a tree leaf and attaches to armor or clothing with a simple strap. When you activate the snapleaf, you gain the benefits of feather fall and a 2nd-level [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md) spell for 1 minute or until you stop falling, whichever comes first.
