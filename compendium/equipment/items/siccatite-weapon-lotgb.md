# Siccatite Weapon *Item 11+*  
[rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** varies by weapon; **Usage** varies by weapon

[Crafting](rules/actions/craft.md) weapons from siccatite is often enough to drive smiths to despair, as the extreme temperature of the metal can cause it to shatter while being worked. Siccatite weapons have substantial grip wrappings to protect their wielders from the metal's extreme temperatures. They're constantly surrounded by a heat haze or a halo of rime, depending on the siccatite's type. Siccatite weapons automatically gain either a flaming or frost property rune, for hot and cold siccatite respectively, even if they aren't otherwise enchanted; this rune can't be removed, and it deals `1d8` damage instead of `1d6` damage. This uses one of the weapon's property rune slots as normal. High-grade siccatite gains a greater flaming (hot siccatite) or greater frost (cold siccatite) property instead.

The Unscathed Blade is a large, sturdy shop with its own living quarters in an attached tower. Its chimney constantly billows plumes of dark smoke. [Small](rules/traits/small-b1.md "Small Size Trait") windows illuminate the shop's front room, allowing the sun to glint off the assorted fine weaponry. The wooden front door is propped open during business hours, and warm air billows out from the shop. The double doors in the back, leading to the narrow alley behind the building, are always thrown wide open whenever the smith, Abiah (N agender human ex-gladiator) is forging weapons. From the alley, one can feel the heated air emanating from the shop and hear the clanging sounds of Abiah hammering new weapons and armor.
