# Siccatite Weapon *Item 11+*  
[rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Usage** varies by weapon; **Bulk** varies by weapon

[Crafting](rules/actions/craft.md) weapons from siccatite is often enough to drive smiths to despair, as the extreme temperature of the metal can cause it to shatter while being worked. Siccatite weapons have substantial grip wrappings to protect their wielders from the metal's extreme temperatures. They're constantly surrounded by a heat haze or a halo of rime, depending on the siccatite's type. Siccatite weapons automatically gain either a flaming or frost property rune, for hot and cold siccatite respectively, even if they aren't otherwise enchanted; this rune can't be removed, and it deals `1d8` damage instead of `1d6` damage. This uses one of the weapon's property rune slots as normal. High-grade siccatite gains a greater flaming (hot siccatite) or greater frost (cold siccatite) property instead.
