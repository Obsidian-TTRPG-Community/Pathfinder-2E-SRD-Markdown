When this stone hits a creature or a hard surface, it explodes with a deafening bang. A thunderstone deals the listed sonic damage and sonic splash damage, and each creature within 10 feet of the space in which the stone exploded must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw with the listed DC or be [deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened) until the end of its next turn. Many types of thunderstone grant an item bonus to attack rolls.
