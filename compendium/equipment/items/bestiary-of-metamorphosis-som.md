# Bestiary Of Metamorphosis *Item 6*  
[grimoire](rules/traits/grimoire-som.md "Grimoire Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 210 gp
- **Bulk** L

This grimoire fancifully illustrates the spells you inscribe within it with illuminated drawings of creatures that have never existed, the pictures changing to depict new ones from time to time.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") envision ([polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md), [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md))

- **Requirements**: You're under the effect of a [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait") spell you prepared from this grimoire that offers a choice of multiple forms

**Effect** You transform into a different form allowed by the [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait") by bending and molding the spell's energy. This reduces the spell's remaining duration by half.
