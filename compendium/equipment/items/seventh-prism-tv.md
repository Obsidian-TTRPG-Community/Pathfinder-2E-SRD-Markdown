Beloved by the church of the Seventh Veil, a seventh prism is a crystal that disperses its internal light, casting an aurora of color. If you use a seventh prism to cast [color spray](compendium/spells/color-spray.md), targets are [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for twice as long as their saving throw indicates.

On a critical failure, the target is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute after its [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) condition ends. Motes of shifting rainbow hues cloud the eyes, making it difficult to see details.
