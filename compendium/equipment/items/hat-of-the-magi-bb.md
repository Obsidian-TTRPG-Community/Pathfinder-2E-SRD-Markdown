# Hat of the Magi *Item 3*  
[arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait")  [conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  

- **Price** 50 gp

This hat comes in many forms, such as a colorful turban or a pointy hat with a brim, and can bear symbols or runes. In all its forms, the hat is the symbol of a stylish and professional mage. It grants you a +1 item bonus to [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) checks and allows you to cast the [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) wizard cantrip as often as you like, using the normal actions to do so.
