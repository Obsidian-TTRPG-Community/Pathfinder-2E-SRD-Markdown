# Folding Drums *Item 5*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 160 gp
- **Usage** varies (see text); **Bulk** varies (see text)
- **Category** Held

You can unfold this virtuoso percussion instrument into a hand drum (1 Bulk), a marching drum set with a shoulder harness and back brace (3 Bulk), or a large standing drum set with a built-in stool (16 Bulk). Changing the folding drum's size is a 3-action [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) activity, and the drums must have sufficient open space to accommodate their new size.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [V](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Varies")

You play a pounding rhythm on the drum. If the next action you use is to cast a composition cantrip that has an emanation, increase the area of the emanation by 30 feet.
