# Tentacle Cannon *Item 7+*

A tentacle cannon is a +1 striking weapon, built using components from squids, krakens, and sometimes even stranger tentacled creatures like alghollthu. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals `1d8` piercing damage. It has the [capacity <5>](rules/traits/capacity-5-tv.md "Capacity Weapon Trait"), [concussive](rules/traits/concussive-g-g.md "Concussive Weapon Trait"), and [fatal <d12>](rules/traits/fatal-d12.md "Fatal Weapon Trait") traits, a range increment of 30 feet, and [reload <2>](rules/traits/reload-2.md "Reload Weapon Trait"). The weapon itself resembles a five-barreled handheld cannon with each barrel made from a hollowed out tentacle.

You cause one of the tentacles forming the weapon's five barrels to stretch out and attempt to pull and grab a creature within 15 feet. The tentacle attempts to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) with a +13 bonus. It can attempt to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) any creature, regardless of size. On a success, the tentacle pulls the creature up to 10 feet directly towards you, until it's in a square adjacent to you.

- **Requirements**: The tentacle cannon has a creature [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed)

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** The cannon fires a spray of ink in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the area must attempt a DC 23 Reflex save. On a failure, the creature is covered in ink and becomes [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round and [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute or until it removes the ink. On a critical failure, the creature becomes [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled); both conditions last for 1 minute or until it removes the ink. The creature, or an adjacent creature, can use an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to remove the ink from its eyes to remove the [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) conditions.
