# Planar Ribbon *Item 20*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")  [unique](rules/traits/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 60000 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

By twisting and twirling this ordinary-looking leather ribbon, you can temporarily bend a rift in space.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [⏲](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency") 1 minute command, envision, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


The ribbon spins and swirls, creating a circular loop in the air through which you can spy on a creature on another plane. This has the effects of a [scrying](compendium/spells/scrying.md) spell (DC 40) against the creature but functions more as a mundane —albeit interplanar—window; a similar loop appears before the target, and for the duration, both sides can clearly see and hear each other through the created portal, but nothing can pass through. You can Sustain the Activation to gain the effects of Sustaining the Spell.

This activation has the [scrying](rules/traits/scrying.md "Scrying Effect Trait") trait.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per round

**Effect** You extend the ribbon to brush against a foe up to 60 feet away. If that creature fails a DC 42 Reflex save, you exchange positions with the target and all of that creature's allies are [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to you until the end of your turn. This activation has the [teleportation](rules/traits/teleportation.md "Teleportation Effect Trait") trait.
