- **Usage** worn mask

Originally designed by a fanatical sect of Gozren priests, goz masks were designed to help navigate the area around the Eye of Abendego. The masks couldn't contend with the might of the storm, but they remain in use by people all around the Mwangi Expanse. These masks are typically made of wood and crafted to sport round, exaggerated features.
