# Bloodbiter *Item 6*  
[cursed](rules/traits/cursed-gmg.md "Cursed Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Usage** curses a piercing or slashing weapon

A _bloodbiter_ weapon is awakened by violence and fueled by blood. When you make a successful attack with the weapon, it inflicts a wound that deals `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) (in addition to its normal damage), but it also deals `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to you. The curse remains dormant until the weapon hits a creature, at which point black thorns protrude from the weapon and dig into your body; the weapon fuses to you and you can't use the hand that holds the weapon for any other purpose. If the weapon is two-handed, it attaches itself to only a single hand (GM's choice).
