- **Usage** curses a piercing or slashing weapon
- **Category** Curse

A _bloodbiter_ weapon is awakened by violence and fueled by blood. When you make a successful attack with the weapon, it inflicts a wound that deals `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) (in addition to its normal damage), but it also deals `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to you. The curse remains dormant until the weapon hits a creature, at which point black thorns protrude from the weapon and dig into your body; the weapon fuses to you and you can't use the hand that holds the weapon for any other purpose. If the weapon is two-handed, it attaches itself to only a single hand (GM's choice).
