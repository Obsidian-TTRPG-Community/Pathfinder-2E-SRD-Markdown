# Brightbloom Posy *Item 8+*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [plant](rules/traits/plant.md "Plant Creature Type Trait")  [spellheart](rules/traits/spellheart-som.md "Spellheart Equipment Trait")  

- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to armor or a weapon

Appearing as vibrant as the day they were picked, this cluster of flowers is arranged in a small spray, tied with a red satin ribbon.

The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 24.

- Armor You gain the ability to speak with flowers, as speak with plants.
- Weapon (disease) After you cast a plant spell by activating the posy, pollen coats your weapon. Your next [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) causes the target to be [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) on a hit ([sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) on a critical hit). If the creature attempts to recover, it sneezes rather than retching (rolling against the spellheart's spell DC). If you don't make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) by the end of your next turn, the pollen becomes inert. Plant creatures are immune.
