This prosthetic eye converts visible light into a telepathic signal that is relayed to the wearer's mind using divination magic. As the wearer's mind must process the telepathic signal in the same way as it would a nerve impulse, the acuity and other abilities related to the vision provided by the magical prosthetic eye matches that of other members of your ancestry (for instance, a goblin with a magical prosthetic eye would be able to see in darkvision, while a human wearing the same prosthetic would need illumination). You can remove or replace a magical prosthetic eye using an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action.
