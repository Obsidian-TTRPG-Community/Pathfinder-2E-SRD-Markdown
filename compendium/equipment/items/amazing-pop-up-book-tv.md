Goblin wizards invented the amazing pop-up book to store their spells without written words, though the tradition has been spreading to illusionists from other cultures. These grimoires have colorful covers and open to reveal three-dimensional scenes illustrating various spells. Goblins delight in constructing the books just right so a terrifying creature, like a horse or dog, pops up toward the reader each time a page is turned.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") envision ([metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md))

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** If your next action is to cast an illusion spell prepared from this grimoire that creates illusory terrain or creatures, such as hallucinatory terrain, you draw forth the pop-up scene. If a creature succeeds, but doesn't critically succeed, at a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion, then just as their mind recognizes the illusion, a startling—though obviously false—illusion pops up somewhere unexpected in their field of vision, visible to only them, dealing mental damage equal to the spell's level.
