# Staff of Final Rest *Item 6+*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [staff](rules/traits/staff.md "Staff Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This white marble staff is carved into the figure of an abstract knight, its shield bearing the symbol of Lastwall, with a wickedly pointed sword made of dark wood raised high above its head. When you wield it as a weapon, it gains the [versatile <P>](rules/traits/versatile-p.md "Versatile Weapon Trait") trait and functions as a wooden stake, allowing you to use it to stake vampires, and your [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) with the staff gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage rolls against undead.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)


You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
```
