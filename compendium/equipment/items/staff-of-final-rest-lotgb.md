- **Category** Staff

This white marble staff is carved into the figure of an abstract knight, its shield bearing the symbol of Lastwall, with a wickedly pointed sword made of dark wood raised high above its head. When you wield it as a weapon, it gains the [versatile <P>](rules/traits/versatile-p.md "Versatile Weapon Trait") trait and functions as a wooden stake, allowing you to use it to stake vampires, and your [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) with the staff gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage rolls against undead.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate

You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
