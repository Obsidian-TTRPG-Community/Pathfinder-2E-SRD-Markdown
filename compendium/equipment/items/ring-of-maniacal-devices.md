# Ring of Maniacal Devices *Item 11+*  
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Bulk** —; **Usage** worn

This ring seems like simple tarnished brass, but it enhances your curiosity about traps and devices of all kinds. You can use an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to pull a set of [thieves' tools](compendium/equipment/items/thieves-tools.md) from the ring. These tools appear in your hand and fold back into the ring if they would leave your possession. They grant you a +2 item bonus to [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) checks to [Disable a Device](rules/actions/disable-a-device.md) and to [Pick a Lock](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md), and the ring's insights grant you the same bonus to [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) checks to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) and [Repair](rules/actions/repair.md) snares and traps.
