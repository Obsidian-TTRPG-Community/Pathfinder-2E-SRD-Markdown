# Dragonscale Staff *Item 14+*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  [staff](rules/traits/staff.md)  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Staff

A multi-hued array of scales covers a dragonscale staff, forming a gradient of color, and a dragon's claw holds a gem upon the staff's head. Dragons give allies these staves as a mark of esteem.

While wielding a dragonscale staff you seem fiercer, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks to [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md).

You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
