Initially crafted by a gifted inventor who no longer had the use of their legs, the inventor's chair is a traveler's chair. It's a marvel of engineering, utilizing clockwork mechanisms to maneuver about. The chair comes equipped with [wheel blades](compendium/equipment/items/wheel-blades-lotgb.md), and portions of its frame contain sterling artisan's tools. The inventor's chair might be a family heirloom or a gift from someone who inherited it. It could instead sit unused in its inventor's abandoned estate, awaiting another user.
