# Devil's Luck *Item 3*  
[contract](rules/traits/contract-lol.md "Contract Item Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Decipher Writing** [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society); **Devil** imp

You've bargained with an imp, one of the least powerful devils, for a fragment of infernal luck.

**Benefit** Once per day, you can roll a saving throw twice and use the higher result.

**Payment** At the termination of your mortal life, your soul must serve the imp for 100 years.

**Hidden Condition** The "termination of mortal life" clause is carefully worded to hasten your demise. You can't use the benefit against a [death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait") effect, and if you roll a failure on a saving throw against a [death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait") effect, you get a critical failure instead.

**Termination Clause** If you critically fail a saving throw against a [death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait") effect and do not die, the contract becomes unenforceable on its terms and is voided.
