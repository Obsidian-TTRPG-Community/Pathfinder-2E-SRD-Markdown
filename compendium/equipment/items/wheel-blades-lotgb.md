A set of large blades have been attached to your chair's wheels. While in the chair, you gain a wheel blade [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).

Your wheel blade deals `1d4` slashing damage and has the agile, [attached](rules/traits/attached.md), and [free-hand](rules/traits/free-hand.md) traits. A wheel blade is a simple melee weapon in the sword weapon group. You can etch weapon runes onto wheel blades. A wheelchair can only have one attached weapon.
