# Camouflage Dye *Item 3+*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md)  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)
- **Category** Consumable

Camouflage dye uses a variety of alchemically treated paints and crushed crystals to make the user particularly hard to distinguish from their surroundings. When you Activate the dye by sprinkling it on yourself or a creature within reach, the target and its clothing change colors, blending into their surroundings until the target makes a sudden movement.

The target can [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md) without cover or concealment for 10 minutes. If the target uses a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action or moves at more than half its Speed, after that action is completed, the effects of camouflage powder end and the creature ceases to be [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) or [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected).
