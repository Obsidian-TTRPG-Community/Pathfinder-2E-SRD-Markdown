# Harrow Spellcards *Item 8*  
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [grimoire](rules/traits/grimoire-som.md "Grimoire Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 475 gp
- **Bulk** L

Crafted of sturdy paper, each card of this harrow deck showcases a beautiful watercolor illustration with space to inscribe a spell below. When shuffled, its cards seem to fly between one another of their own accord.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") envision ([fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md))

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger**: Your last action was to cast a divination spell prepared from this grimoire

**Effect** You draw forth a card to gain insight into future challenges you'll face. Draw a card from a harrow deck or roll `1d6`: 1 = hammers ([Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics)), 2 = keys ([Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics)), 3 = shields ([Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival)), 4 = books (any [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md)), 5 = stars ([Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion)), 6 = crowns ([Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy)). The next time you attempt a check of the same type as your result, roll twice and take the better result, as the spirits of the harrow guide your actions. If not used by your next daily preparations, this benefit disappears.
