Blister ammunition is loaded with alchemically processed irritants, such as pollen, pepper, and formic acid. A creature hit by activated blister ammunition must attempt a Fortitude save or begin to itch uncontrollably in addition to damage the attack normally deals. On a critical hit, increase the Fortitude DC by 2, and the target is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round. For the duration, each time the target attempts a concentrate action, it must attempt a DC 8 flat check, losing the action on a failure. An affected creature can use a single [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to scratch and sneeze, allowing it to automatically pass the flat check. The effect ends early once an affected creature spends 3 [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions scratching and sneezing. These [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions don't need to be consecutive.
