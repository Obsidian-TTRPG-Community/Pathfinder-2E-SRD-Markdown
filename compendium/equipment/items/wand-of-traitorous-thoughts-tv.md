```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate

You cast [mind probe](compendium/spells/mind-probe.md). The first time the target rolls a success at a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check to mislead your probe, it gets a result one step worse than it rolled.

This means you learn the answer if the target's [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check would have succeeded, and you learn nothing rather than believing a falsehood if the check would have been a critical success.
