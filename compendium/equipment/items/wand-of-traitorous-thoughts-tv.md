# Wand of Traitorous Thoughts *Item 12*  
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  [wand](rules/traits/wand.md "Wand Item Trait")  

- **Price** 2000 gp
- **Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of mind probe.
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

When you hold this sleek, shiny gray wand, you hear a faint chorus of overlapping whispers.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day, plus overcharge

**Effect** You cast [mind probe](compendium/spells/mind-probe.md). The first time the target rolls a success at a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check to mislead your probe, it gets a result one step worse than it rolled.

This means you learn the answer if the target's [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check would have succeeded, and you learn nothing rather than believing a falsehood if the check would have been a critical success.
```
