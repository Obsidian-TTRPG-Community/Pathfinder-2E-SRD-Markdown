Coiled tentacles make it all but impossible to see anything else inside this ampoule. When opened, a Gargantuan kraken bursts forth, which can appear in water instead of on the ground. Its arms attempt to grasp up to four creatures with a reach of 60 feet. The kraken repositions [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) creatures to a different space within its reach unless the target succeeds at a DC 38 Fortitude save.

If the kraken is in water, it then releases a cloud of ink in an 80-foot emanation. This cloud has no effect outside of water. Creatures inside the cloud are [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected), can't use their sense of smell, and are exposed to kraken ink poison (Bestiary 214). The cloud dissipates after 1 minute.
