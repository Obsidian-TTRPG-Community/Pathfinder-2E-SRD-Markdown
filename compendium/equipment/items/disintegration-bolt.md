# Disintegration Bolt *Item 15*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 1300 gp
- **Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of disintegrate.
- **Ammunition** [bolt](compendium/equipment/items/bolt.md)
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

The shaft of this bolt is scorched and blackened, and handling it coats your fingers with a fine black powder. When an activated disintegration bolt hits a target, it is subject to a [disintegrate](compendium/spells/disintegrate.md) spell requiring a DC 34 Fortitude save. As with the spell, a critical hit on the attack roll causes the target's saving throw outcome to be one degree worse.
