The shaft of this bolt is scorched and blackened, and handling it coats your fingers with a fine black powder. When an activated disintegration bolt hits a target, it is subject to a [disintegrate](compendium/spells/disintegrate.md) spell requiring a DC 34 Fortitude save. As with the spell, a critical hit on the attack roll causes the target's saving throw outcome to be one degree worse.
