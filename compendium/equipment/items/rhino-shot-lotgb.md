This arrow is made of polished animal horn, with the head of a rhinoceros carved in place of a traditional arrowhead.

When an activated rhino shot is fired, the ethereal form of a large rhinoceros takes shape around the projectile. On a successful [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), the attack deals an additional `2d6` force damage, and the target must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone). If the hit with the rhino shot was a critical success, the target is knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) unless it critically succeeds at its save.
