A broad wooden tube with a handle, a sparking spellgun radiates warmth. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target's AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet. The spellgun fires a small ball of sparks and fire, then crumbles to ash. The ball explodes in a flash when it hits, dealing fire damage and [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) according to its type.
