- **Price** 14 gp

- **Category** Poison

The euphemistically named saboteur's friend looks, smells, and tastes like an appetizing chocolate square. You lace the chocolate with reagents that induce a strong laxative effect.

Saboteur's friend is useful for incapacitating rather than dealing lasting harm. Unlike some poisons, saboteur's friend can have its [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition reduced (but changing to a higher or lower stage after a save applies any [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition listed for that stage, as normal).
