- **Usage** curses a ring, staff, or wand

An _arsonous_ curse creates flaws in the mystic pathways that channel magic through an item, allowing excess power to escape as sparks. Whenever you [activate](rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) the magic item, a random ally within 30 feet takes `1d10` persistent fire damage. If no ally is in range, you take the damage instead. At the GM's discretion, this curse might ignite an unattended object or the surrounding environment instead.
