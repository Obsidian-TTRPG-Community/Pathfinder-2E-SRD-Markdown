# Firefoot Popcorn *Item 8*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  

- **Price** 75 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

When you consume firefoot popcorn, for 1 minute, you can [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) double the normal distance. You can also attempt to [High Jump](rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](rules/actions/long-jump.md) as a single action. If you do, you don't perform the initial [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) (nor do you fall if you don't [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) 10 feet). Each time you [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) 10 feet or more, your feet make a popping sound that can be heard from at least 100 feet, and the space you left fills with waves of intense heat. For 1 minute, that square is hazardous terrain that deals `1d6` fire damage to any creature that moves into it.
