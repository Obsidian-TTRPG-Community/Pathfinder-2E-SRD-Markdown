[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 1000 gp
- **Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of pest form.
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** worn armor

The cuirass of this +1 deathless (see above) resilient leather armor, stitched to resemble an Osiriani scarab beetle, feels strangely chitinous. You gain resistance 5 to negative damage.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You cast a 1st-level [pest form](compendium/spells/pest-form.md). You can only become a scarab beetle.
