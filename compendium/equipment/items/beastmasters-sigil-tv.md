# Beastmaster's Sigil *Item 5+*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [spellheart](rules/traits/spellheart-som.md "Spellheart Equipment Trait")  

- **Bulk** —; **Usage** affixed to armor or a weapon

This silver disc displays an ever-changing etching of an animal.

When you affix the beastmaster's sigil, the animal settles into a single form based on where you affix it, showing the animal the item can summon when affixed that way. The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 19. A weapon can benefit from only the melee weapon benefit or ranged weapon benefit. A thrown melee weapon gets the melee weapon benefit, and a combination weapon gets only one benefit, which you choose when you affix the spellheart. If it's unclear which one should apply, the GM decides.

- Armor The sigil grants you a +1 item bonus to saving throws against poison.
- Melee Weapon The sigil grants you a +1 item bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md).
- Ranged Weapon If you critically hit with the affixed weapon, and the target is adjacent to a creature summoned with the sigil, the target takes `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
