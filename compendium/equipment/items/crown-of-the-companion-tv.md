Stories tell of a king who once loved his subjects so much he was willing to give his own life energy for them, using an object like the crown of the companion. Whether true or not, this majestic wooden crown bears elaborate carvings depicting that tale with images of a regal figure giving increasingly of themself to a throng of needy subjects. While wearing this crown, you gain a +1 item bonus to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks.

You bow to an ally within 30 feet, creating a magical bond between the two of you as if you cast [shield](compendium/spells/shield.md) other targeting the ally. The link remains even if you move more than 30 feet away from them. At the end of the spell's duration, your ally recovers `4d8` Hit Points and you recover half of what they recover.
