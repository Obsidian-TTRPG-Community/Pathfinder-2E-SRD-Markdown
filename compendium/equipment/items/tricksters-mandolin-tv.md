Sought after by many unscrupulous bards, this instrument is surprisingly light and easy to carry, but also empowered with a number of spells carefully selected to help with fooling others or making a hasty retreat. While playing the mandolin, you gain a +1 item bonus to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) and [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks.
