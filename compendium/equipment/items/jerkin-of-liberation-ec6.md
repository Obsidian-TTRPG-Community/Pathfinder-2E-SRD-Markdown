# Jerkin Of Liberation *Item 17*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  armor  

- **Price** 14000 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** worn armor

This +2 greater resilient studded leather is traditionally inscribed with a symbol of either [Norgorber](compendium/setting/deities/norgorber.md) or [Cayden Cailean](compendium/setting/deities/cayden-cailean.md). Its leather is light as silk, and its buttons and studs are gleaming crystal. While you wear it, you get a +15-foot item bonus to your Speed, and effects that attempt to impose penalties on your Speed must first counteract the jerkin of liberation or they have no effect on you.

In addition, you are hard to incapacitate. You use the jerkin's item level or your own level, whichever is higher, to determine effects of the [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait") trait.
