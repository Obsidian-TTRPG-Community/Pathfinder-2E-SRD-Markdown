# Scholarly Journal *Item 3*  
[uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** L
- **Hands** 1

Scholarly journals are uncommon. Each scholarly journal is a folio on a very specific topic, such as vampires or the history of a single town or neighborhood of a city. If you spend 1 minute referencing an academic journal before attempting a skill check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about the subject, you gain a +1 item bonus to the check. The GM determines what scholarly journals are available in any location.

### Variants

#### Scholarly Journal *Item 0*

- **Price**: 6 gp

#### Scholarly Journal Compendium *Item 3*

- **Price**: 30 gp

A compendium of journals costs five times as much as a single journal and requires both hands to use; each compendium contains several journals and grants its bonus on a broader topic, such as all undead or a whole city.
