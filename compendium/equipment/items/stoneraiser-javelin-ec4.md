# Stoneraiser Javelin *Item 11*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")

This stone-headed +2 striking returning javelin draws forth the power of the earth itself to strike at enemies.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You hurl the stoneraiser javelin at an unoccupied space within 30 feet. The javelin's power flows into the ground, which erupts in a 5-foot-radius burst of razor-sharp stalagmites.

The stalagmites are 10 feet tall. Everything on each side of the stalagmites has cover from creatures on the opposite side, and the stalagmites' spaces are difficult terrain.

A creature takes `4d4` piercing damage for every move action it takes that enters at least one of the affected spaces. Each 5-foot-by-5-foot section has AC 10, Hardness 14, and 30 Hit Points. It's immune to critical hits and precision damage. A destroyed section can be moved through freely.

The stalagmites crumble to dust after 1 minute.

Any creature in the area when the stalagmites appear is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space of its choice; this movement is forced movement. Pushed creatures must attempt a DC 28 Reflex saving throw or take `4d4` piercing damage.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
