```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") envision

- **Frequency**: once per minute

**Effect** You aim through the crossbow's crystalline lenses, gaining imprecise vision onto the Ethereal Plane with a range of 60 feet in addition to your normal senses for the rest of your turn. While this effect lasts, your next [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the spiritsight crossbow can also affect targets on the Ethereal Plane during the first 60 feet of its flight.
