This +1 striking [ghost touch](compendium/equipment/items/ghost-touch.md) crossbow has an array of crystalline lenses and silver fittings along the stock and feels strangely light.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You aim through the crossbow's crystalline lenses, gaining imprecise vision onto the Ethereal Plane with a range of 60 feet in addition to your normal senses for the rest of your turn. While this effect lasts, your next [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the spiritsight crossbow can also affect targets on the Ethereal Plane during the first 60 feet of its flight.
