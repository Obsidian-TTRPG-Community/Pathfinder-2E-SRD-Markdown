- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

This mirrored bottle contains various chemicals dissolved in two immiscible solvents. Shaking the bottle induces chemical reactions that cause it to glow. For 1 hour, the bottle sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 40 feet). During this hour, it can be thrown like a bomb. This requires a single action to Activate with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), like other bombs, and deals the damage below. If it's not thrown within an hour of the first activation, it defuses harmlessly and is consumed.

### Variants

#### lesser *Item 2*

- **Price**: 7 gp

The bomb deals `1d4` positive damage and 1 positive [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage, as well as `1d4` additional fire damage. As normal, positive damage harms only undead and other creatures with negative healing. Undead with a particular vulnerability to sunlight (such as vampires or wraiths) take the maximum amount of positive damage from bottled sunlight (4 instead of `1d4`). For any ability that depends on the number of weapon dice bottled sunlight has, count only the positive damage dice.

#### moderate *Item 4*

- **Price**: 20 gp

The bomb deals `2d4` positive damage, 2 positive [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage, and `2d4` additional fire damage.

#### greater *Item 12*

- **Price**: 360 gp

The bomb deals `3d4` positive damage, 3 positive [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage, and `3d4` additional fire damage.

#### major *Item 18*

- **Price**: 4500 gp

The bomb deals `4d4` positive damage, 4 positive [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage, and `4d4` additional fire damage.
