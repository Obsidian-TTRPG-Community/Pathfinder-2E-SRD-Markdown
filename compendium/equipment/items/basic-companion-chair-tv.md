Light barding around the torso connects via struts to a number of wheels to assist animal companions' movement.

Companion chairs can be fitted for animal companions of any shape or size and have two- and four-wheel configurations depending on the level of physical support needed. Like the basic chair, a companion chair is ideal for everyday use but not more strenuous activity, making it more common among non-adventurers.
