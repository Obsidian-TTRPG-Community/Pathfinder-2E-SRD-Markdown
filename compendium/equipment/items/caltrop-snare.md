# Caltrop Snare *Item 1*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [snare](rules/traits/snare.md "Snare Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Price** 3 gp
- **Craft Requirements** Supply a container of caltrops.

This snare consists of a [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) canister of [caltrops](compendium/equipment/items/caltrops.md) attached to a trip wire. When the snare is triggered, it flings the caltrops into either the snare's square or a square adjacent to the snare. You choose which square when you set up the snare.

If the [caltrops](compendium/equipment/items/caltrops.md) scatter into the same square as a creature, that creature must attempt the [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check immediately.
