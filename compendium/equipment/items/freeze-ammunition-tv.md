# Freeze Ammunition *Item 5*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [cold](rules/traits/cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait")  

- **Price** 28 gp
- **Ammunition** any
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

Freeze ammunition carries chilling reagents that activate on contact with the target. A creature hit by activated freeze ammunition takes cold damage instead of the weapon's normal damage type, plus 2 cold splash damage. Hitting a 5-foot-square surface successfully with freeze ammunition deals 2 cold splash damage and covers the space in a layer of ice. Each creature standing on the icy surface must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check or else fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).

Creatures using an action to move onto the icy surface must attempt either a Reflex save or an [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Balance](rules/actions/balance.md). Creatures that [Step](rules/actions/step.md) or [Crawl](rules/actions/crawl.md) don't need to attempt a check or save. The ice melts after 1 minute, although unusually hot or cold temperatures can change this duration at the GM's discretion. Dealing at least 1 point of fire damage to the ice removes it instantly.
