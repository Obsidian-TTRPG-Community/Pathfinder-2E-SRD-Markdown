# Dreamstone *Item 9*  
[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 700 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

A _dreamstone_ is a disc-shaped object carved with imagery or words sacred to [Desna](compendium/setting/deities/desna.md)â€”be it her religious symbol, a short prayer, or merely the shape of a single star. When you carry a _dreamstone_, you find it easier to fall asleep, and you gain improved effects from the resulting rest. You always fall asleep within 5 minutes of lying down with the intention of sleeping, and you require only 2 hours of sleep per day to gain the benefits of 8 hours of sleep, provided you have carried the _dreamstone_ for at least 24 hours prior to resting. As long as you carry a _dreamstone_, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against [sleep](rules/traits/sleep.md "Sleep Effect Trait") effects.

title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) ([metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md))

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) of 4th level or lower that has the [sleep](rules/traits/sleep.md "Sleep Effect Trait") trait or is associated with dreams, the spell slot is not expended.
