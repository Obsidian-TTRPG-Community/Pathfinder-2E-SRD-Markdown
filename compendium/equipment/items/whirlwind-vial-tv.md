Opening this vial releases a mighty gust, forming into a fearsome Huge elemental hurricane. The elemental breathes a 30-foot cone of air. Each creature in the cone must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or be knocked away from the elemental.

A creature knocked into a solid object stops moving and takes `4d6` bludgeoning damage.
