# Perfected Robes *Item 22*  
[artifact](rules/traits/artifact-gmg.md "Artifact Item Trait")  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn

These unadorned white robes, fastened with simple brass pins in the shape of a human hand, can't be soiled or blemished. While wearing perfected robes, you don't need to eat, sleep, or drink, but you can if you choose to. The robes bless you with constant true seeing (+32 counteract bonus). A creature who dons these robes without earning them is [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy), [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled), and [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) while wearing them, gaining the true seeing but otherwise unable to use the robes' magic.

- **Frequency**: once per minute

**Effect** If your next action is to attempt a d20 roll with which you have legendary proficiency, roll twice and take the better result. This is a [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait") effect.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, envision

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You cast [avatar](compendium/spells/avatar.md), gaining the abilities for [Irori](compendium/setting/deities/irori.md).

Destruction If the wearer ever willingly turns from the path of self-perfection into corruption or overindulgence, their perfected robes crumble to nothing.
