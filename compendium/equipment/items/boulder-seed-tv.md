# Boulder Seed *Item 12+*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [bomb](rules/traits/bomb.md "Bomb Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)

This bomb is made of volatile fluids that rapidly expand and harden when exposed to air. A boulder seed grants an item bonus to attack rolls and deals bludgeoning damage and bludgeoning splash damage, according to the bomb's type. When activated, the bomb fills a 5-foot cube with hardened foam, which has stats according to the bomb's type and which pushes a primary target of a certain size or smaller occupying that space 5 feet away from you. On a critical hit, the target also falls [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone). The splash zone fills with rubble, creating difficult terrain. The "boulder" the bomb creates fails all saving throws and loses 1 Hardness per round, disintegrating into fine powder when the boulder's Hardness is reduced to 0. At that time, the difficult terrain the bomb created also disappears.
