# Codebreaker's Parchment *Item 3+*  
[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 2 hands

This finely crafted, seemingly mundane parchment is useful for writing sensitive documents. When words are written on this parchment, they instantly scramble into unrecognizable script, requiring a DC 20 check to [Decipher Writing](rules/actions/decipher-writing.md).

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") command


The scrambled words align into the originally written script. Identifying the parchment reveals that it can be activated with a command, but a critical success to [Identify Magic](rules/actions/identify-magic.md) is needed to learn the command word.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You light the parchment on fire, burning the words off while leaving the parchment unharmed and ready to bear more text.
