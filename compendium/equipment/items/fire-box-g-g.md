- **Price** 10 gp

Anyone who opens the box triggers a clockwork mechanism that unleashes a 15-foot cone of fire. The cone issues forth in a random direction determined by the GM but always including the creature who opened the box. Those within the cone must succeed at a DC 17 basic Reflex save or take `4d6` fire damage.
