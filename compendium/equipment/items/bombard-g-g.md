- **Price** 300 gp

Bombards are some of the oldest and simplest of black powder siege weapons, devised based on many of the same principles as a hand cannon, but deploying them on a larger scale and scope. A bombard's body is usually made of brass or iron, which causes the bombard to resemble the shape of a large bell. While they are capable of moving very slowly, their [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and weighty design means bombards usually remain stationary. This in turn means they're often used more defensively than offensively.
