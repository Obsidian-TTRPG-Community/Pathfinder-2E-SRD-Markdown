# Dread Helm *Item 4*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [aura](rules/traits/aura.md "Aura Combat Trait")  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Price** 100 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

The faceplate of a dread helm has a fierce visage that magnifies the effects of fear. Cleverly [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) within is a reservoir that can hold a single dread ampoule (Advanced Player's Guide 253), which takes 3 [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions to install.

A loaded dread helm can be activated to atomize the dread ampoule, creating a fear-inducing mist that hangs around your face. The mist grants an item bonus to [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks equal to the dread ampoule's item bonus. The mist also deals mental damage equal to the dread ampoule's [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage to all creatures within a 5-foot emanation other than you. The effects last for 3 rounds, consuming the dread ampoule, and once the atomization process has begun it can't be deactivated.
