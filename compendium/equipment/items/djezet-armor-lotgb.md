# Djezet Armor *Item 12+*  
[rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** varies by armor; **Usage** worn armor

Armor made of djezet alloy is easy to enchant. Transferring runes onto djezet armor from other armor waives the usual 1/10 cost to etch the rune. This benefit has no effect on the cost of the rune itself or on the cost to transfer a rune off djezet armor onto a non-djezet armor. High-grade djezet armor can be etched with an additional property rune (to a maximum of four instead of three for +3 armor).
