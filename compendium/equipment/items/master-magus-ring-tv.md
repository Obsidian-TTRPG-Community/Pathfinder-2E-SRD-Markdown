# Master Magus Ring *Item 11*  
[arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait")  [conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [focused](rules/traits/focused.md "Focused Item Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")

- **Craft Requirements** You are a magus.
- **Bulk** —; **Usage** worn

Elegant jewelry such as the master magus ring adorns experienced magi. Each ring has a significant metal and symbol to represent a particular hybrid study, such as a heavy iron ring with an icon of a mountain for inexorable iron, or glittering silver with a shield-like emblem for sparkling targe.

You gain a +2 item bonus to [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") command

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** The ring transports you and any items you're wearing and holding from your current space to an unoccupied space you can see within a range equal to your Speed. If this would bring another creature with you—even if you're carrying it in an extradimensional container—the activation fails and is used.
