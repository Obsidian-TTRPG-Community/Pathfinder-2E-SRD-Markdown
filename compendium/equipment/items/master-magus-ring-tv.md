Elegant jewelry such as the master magus ring adorns experienced magi. Each ring has a significant metal and symbol to represent a particular hybrid study, such as a heavy iron ring with an icon of a mountain for inexorable iron, or glittering silver with a shield-like emblem for sparkling targe.

You gain a +2 item bonus to [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) checks.

You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can use only to cast a magus conflux spell. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.

The ring transports you and any items you're wearing and holding from your current space to an unoccupied space you can see within a range equal to your Speed. If this would bring another creature with you—even if you're carrying it in an extradimensional container—the activation fails and is used.
