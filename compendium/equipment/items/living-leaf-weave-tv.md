This suit of leaf weave armor (page 9) is specially modified to metabolize the alchemical accelerants in medicinal compounds.

A special receptacle in the armor can hold an elixir of life, which takes 3 [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions to install. A loaded suit of living leaf weave can be activated to grow slithering vines from the armor, granting an item bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), to your Fortitude DC to resist [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md), or [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) attempts, and to your Reflex DCs to resist [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) attempts. The effects last for 3 rounds, consuming the elixir of life, and once the reaction has begun it can't be deactivated.
