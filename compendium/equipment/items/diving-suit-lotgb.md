# Diving Suit *Item 3*  

- **Price** 100 gp
- **Usage** worn clothing; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Worn

Diving suits are bulky, waterproofed leather outfits with copper helmets, worn by divers and underwater salvagers.

The suit grants a +1 item bonus to [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) checks made underwater, and the helmet features tubes for connecting [bottled air](compendium/equipment/items/bottled-air.md). When connected to a diving suit, bottled air doesn't need to be held and can be used to breathe as a free action. If you wear armor over a diving suit, you become [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) until you remove the diving suit.
