With a sharp twist of this item, you instantly create a screen of thick, opaque smoke in a burst centered on one corner of your space. All creatures within that area are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed), and all other creatures are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind.
