# Hundred-moth Caress *Item 8*  
[divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Price** 475 gp
- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** held in 2 hands

The handles of this +1 striking scythe are made from a dull, gray wood of bone-like consistency, and when you slice with it, a fluttering gust of hundreds of moths' wingbeats fills the air. If you're a devotee of [Urgathoa](compendium/setting/deities/urgathoa.md), you can use this scythe as a divine focus, and with every [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), it exudes a pallid cloud of powdery dust.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") command ([divine](rules/traits/divine.md), [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md), [negative](rules/traits/negative.md))

- **Frequency**: once per round

**Effect** You deal `1d10` negative damage to yourself. If your next action is to [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the scythe or to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with the [disease](rules/traits/disease.md "Disease Effect Trait") or [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait") trait, that [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or spell deals additional negative damage equal to the damage you took (after any reductions or increases from immunity, resistances, weaknesses).
