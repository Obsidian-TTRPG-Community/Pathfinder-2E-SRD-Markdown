While wearing this silver religious symbol of [Erastil](compendium/setting/deities/erastil.md), you can cast the [disrupt undead](compendium/spells/disrupt-undead.md) cantrip as an innate divine spell.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")

By touching a weapon you wield to the symbol and uttering a plea for [Erastil](compendium/setting/deities/erastil.md)'s steadying hand, you grant that weapon the [deadly <d12>](rules/traits/deadly-d12.md "Deadly Weapon Trait") trait. Against undead, the weapon instead gains the fatal <d12> trait. This blessing lasts for 1 minute, until you score a critical hit with the weapon, or until you aren't wielding the weapon.
