This glass ring contains a swirling cloud of grayish smoke.

When you invest the ring, the smoke becomes as transparent as the glass encapsulating it, and you can see clearly into the Ethereal Plane with a range of 60 feet. Whether or not you have invested the ring, you are also visible to creatures in the Ethereal Plane within the same range. Although you can see these creatures and they can see you, you can't affect each other except with abilities that cross between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane.
