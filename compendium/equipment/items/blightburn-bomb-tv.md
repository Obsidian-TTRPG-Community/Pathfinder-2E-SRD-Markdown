Blightburn bombs have radioactive materials sealed inside flasks treated with lead. The bomb grants an item bonus to attack rolls and deals poison damage, [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and poison splash damage, according to the bomb's type. A creature that takes the [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) deals the splash damage again from its current position as the radiation continues to harm nearby creatures. The [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) can last up to 1 minute.

Blightburn bombs also expose the primary target to blightburn sickness (page 45) at the listed Fortitude DC.
