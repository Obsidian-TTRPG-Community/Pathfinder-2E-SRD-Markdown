Blightburn bombs have radioactive materials sealed inside flasks treated with lead. The bomb grants an item bonus to attack rolls and deals poison damage, [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and poison [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage, according to the bomb's type. A creature that takes the [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) deals the [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage again from its current position as the radiation continues to harm nearby creatures. The [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) can last up to 1 minute.

Blightburn bombs also expose the primary target to [blightburn sickness](compendium/gm/afflictions/blightburn-sickness-tv.md) at the listed Fortitude DC.
