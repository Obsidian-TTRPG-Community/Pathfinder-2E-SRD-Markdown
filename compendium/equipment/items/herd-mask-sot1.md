# Herd Mask *Item 6*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [teleportation](rules/traits/teleportation.md "Teleportation Effect Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 210 gp
- **Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of dimension door. You can link a herd mask you create to another herd mask in your possession when you finish crafting it, which causes it to be linked to the chosen mask as well as all other herd masks that are also linked to the chosen mask.
- **Usage** worn mask

All herd masks are linked to at least one other herd mask and are usually sold in sets of multiple masks. Linked herd masks look similar to one another, with only the slightest of differences to tell them apart.

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You swap locations with another creature wearing a linked herd mask within 100 feet. If you and the creature you swapped with are disguised as each other, other creatures gain an immediate [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check against the lower of your or the other wearer's [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) DCs to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) each other. On a failure, they don't realize the swap occurred.
