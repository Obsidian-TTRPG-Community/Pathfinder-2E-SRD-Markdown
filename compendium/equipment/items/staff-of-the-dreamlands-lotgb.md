- **Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells. Whether one chooses to wander off the beaten path or accidentally turns too soon from the main thoroughfare, the Grand Bazaar's nooks, crannies, and winding lanes all hold vendors eager to catch the attention of any passersby. The following are but a small sample of the countless shops a visitor may encounter at the Grand Bazaar.
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

The carved night hag's hand at the end of this sandalwood staff clutches a rough gem. The staff of the Dreamlands makes it easier to navigate and survive in the Dreamlands and recognize its denizens. When wielding the staff, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) checks while in the Dreamlands and to checks to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about creatures with the [dream](rules/traits/dream-b2.md "Dream Creature Type Trait") trait.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)


You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
```
