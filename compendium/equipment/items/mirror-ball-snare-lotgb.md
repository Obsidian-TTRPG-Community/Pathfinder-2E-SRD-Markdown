[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [snare](rules/traits/snare.md "Snare Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Price** 40 gp

A mixture of metal shavings and flash powder inside this small, mirrored sphere ignites when disturbed, causing the ball to flash and spin. When a creature enters the square, the ball pops into the air, and all creatures within 10 feet who can see the mirror ball must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or become [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round. On a critical failure, affected creatures are instead [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute.
