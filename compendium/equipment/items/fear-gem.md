# Fear Gem *Item 4*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 20 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to a weapon
- **Activate** [Intimidating Strike](compendium/feats/intimidating-strike.md)

Dark smoke seems to writhe within this obsidian gem. When you activate the gem, you make an [Intimidating Strike](compendium/feats/intimidating-strike.md), as the fighter feat.

If you have the [Intimidating Strike](compendium/feats/intimidating-strike.md) feat, increase the [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition value from this Intimidating [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) to [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened), or [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical hit.
