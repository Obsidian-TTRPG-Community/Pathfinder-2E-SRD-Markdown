# Fulu Compendium *Item 9*

This pamphlet-sized book records the various symbols seen on fulu and also contains some ready-made magic on a special page that restores itself every day at sunrise.

Using the compendium as a reference grants a +2 item bonus to any skill checks to determine a fulu's function or authenticity.

You rip a page from the fulu compendium and cast it in a wide arc; as it flies in that arc, it multiplies into a storm of fulus. All undead creatures in a 30-foot emanation are affected by a spirit-sealing fulu with a save DC of 25.
