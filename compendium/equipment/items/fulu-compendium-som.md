# Fulu Compendium *Item 9*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 550 gp

This pamphlet-sized book records the various symbols seen on fulu and also contains some ready-made magic on a special page that restores itself every day at sunrise.

Using the compendium as a reference grants a +2 item bonus to any skill checks to determine a fulu's function or authenticity.

title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You rip a page from the fulu compendium and cast it in a wide arc; as it flies in that arc, it multiplies into a storm of fulus. All undead creatures in a 30-foot emanation are affected by a spirit-sealing fulu with a save DC of 25.
