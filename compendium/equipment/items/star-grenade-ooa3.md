# Star Grenade *Item 1+*

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** These unusual gunpowder bombs, typically marked with a

symbol of a four-pointed star on their outer surface, explode outward in the shape of a cross whenever they [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) a target.

When you throw a star grenade, arrange two perpendicular 25-foot lines over the target, both centered on the target and moving straight through the target, not diagonally. Creatures other than the target within these two lines take [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage (typically 8 squares take [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage for a Medium creature). [Any](rules/traits/any-b1.md "Any Alignment Trait") effect that alters or adjusts the splash area's shape or size, like the alchemist feat Expanded Splash, doesn't apply to star grenades.
