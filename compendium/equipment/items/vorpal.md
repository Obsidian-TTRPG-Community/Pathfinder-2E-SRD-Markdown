# Vorpal *Item 17*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 15000 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a slashing melee weapon

Originally created as a means of slaying the legendary jabberwock, vorpal weapons prove equally effective against nearly any foe with a head.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") envision ([death](rules/traits/death.md), [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md))

- **Trigger**: You roll a natural 20 on a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the weapon, critically succeed, and deal slashing damage.

**Effect** The target must succeed at a DC 37 Fortitude save or be decapitated. This kills any creature except ones that don't require a head to live. For creatures with multiple heads, this usually kills the creature only if you sever its last head.
