# Wheelbarrow *Item 0*  

- **Price** 5 sp
- **Bulk** 5; **Usage** held in 2 hands

This small, hand-propelled vehicle has a single wheel and is designed to carry large loads over a distance. A wheelbarrow can typically hold up to 5 Bulk of objects without issue. The GM might rule that it can hold more Bulk of particular items, such as sand, or less Bulk of other items, like awkwardly shaped rocks.

You can raise or place a wheelbarrow using an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action and can [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) your normal Speed while you have the wheelbarrow raised, though you're [encumbered](rules/conditions.md#Encumbered) while pushing a wheelbarrow. You can [Release](rules/actions/release.md) a wheelbarrow as normal, but a loaded wheelbarrow has a chance of tipping over if you don't place it down with care. When you [Release](rules/actions/release.md) a wheelbarrow, attempt a DC 7 flat check. On a failure, the wheelbarrow tips over, spilling its contents into a randomly determined adjacent space.

"Of course I have a half-gallon of djezet in stock. And you're lucky I'm the one selling it, because frankly, whatever you plan to do with that would make a less professional merchant rather curious." Tesyovensku works out of a moderately-sized warehouse off the Bazaar proper that they rent out as storage to construction material suppliers. The warehouse is often full of wooden beams, bricks, and bags of cement as a result, giving it an aroma of fresh-milled lumber and damp stone.
