# Elemental Ammunition *Item 1+*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md)  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md)  [splash](rules/traits/splash.md)  

- **Ammunition** any
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)
- **Category** Consumable

When activated, the reservoir of alchemical reagents in elemental ammunition atomizes on impact, dealing [persistent acid](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage to the target and splash damage in addition to the damage the attack normally deals. Each damage type requires a different formula, and the ammunition gains a trait matching the damage type.
