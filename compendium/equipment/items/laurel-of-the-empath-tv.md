# Laurel of the Empath *Item 20*  
[apex](rules/traits/apex.md "Apex Item Trait")  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 70000 gp
- **Bulk** —; **Usage** worn cap

This silvery, woven ring of leaves sits on top of the head. While wearing it, when you roll [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) for initiative, you can roll twice and take the higher result. This is a [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait") effect. Whenever you spend at least 1 minute talking with a living creature, you automatically become aware of its attitude toward you. When you invest the laurel, you either increase your Wisdom score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.

**Effect** You spend 10 minutes talking with one living creature, conversing in inspirational, religious, or philosophical terms.

When the ritual is over, you gain a +4 item bonus to all [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks made concerning the target for one month. Also, the target gains inspirational insight, allowing the target to use one of the two reactions listed above once during the next 24 hours.
