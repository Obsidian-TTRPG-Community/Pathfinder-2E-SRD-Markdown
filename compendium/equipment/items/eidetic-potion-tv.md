# Eidetic Potion *Item 6*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [potion](rules/traits/potion.md "Potion Item Trait")  

- **Price** 40 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

Bright pink, pale lavender, and vibrant orange colors swirl through this purplish liquid, making the eidetic potion resemble an unforgettable sunset. When you drink this potion, for 1 round, anything you observe becomes locked into your memory. You can recall the memory perfectly and gain a +2 status bonus to create representations of that memory, whether using [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) to create an artistic rendition or [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) to create a Forgery. The memory remains locked for 1 week or until you benefit from the bonus it imparts for the first time, whichever comes first; afterward, it becomes a normal, fallible memory. You can only have a single memory locked in your mind at a time. Using this potion while you have a locked memory from a previous use makes the previously locked memory fallible but allows you to lock a new memory.
