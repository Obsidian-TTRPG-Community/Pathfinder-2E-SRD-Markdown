Stasian actuators help the limbs of this full plate move of their own accord, as long as they're supplied with power. A chamber in the chest plate can hold a single bottled lightning, which takes 3 [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions to install. A loaded suit of powered full plate can be activated to lower the armor's Strength requirement by 1 plus the item bonus of the loaded bomb. The armor's normal penalties still apply, based on this altered Strength. However, add the bottled lightning's item bonus to your [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Force Open](rules/actions/force-open.md), [High Jump](rules/actions/high-jump.md), [Long Jump](rules/actions/long-jump.md), and [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md). These effects last for 10 minutes. The armor uses up the bottled lightning during the duration and can't be activated again until a new one is installed.
