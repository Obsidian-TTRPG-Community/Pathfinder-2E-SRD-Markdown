[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 476 gp
- **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the hide of a rust monster (Bestiary 283).
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** worn armor

This +1 leather lamellar armor incorporates the plates of a rust monster's hide, woven together with the creature's own antennae and sinew into a functional set of armor. While wearing the rusting carapace, you gain a +2 item bonus to your Reflex save to prevent an object you're holding from being affected by rust; this also increases your Reflex DC to avoid being Disarmed by a rust monster's Antenna Disarm ability.
