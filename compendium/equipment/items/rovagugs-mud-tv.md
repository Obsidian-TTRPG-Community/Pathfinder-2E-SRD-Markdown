[Rovagug](compendium/setting/deities/rovagug.md)'s mud smells and tastes like wet, sour earth. For 1 hour after you drink it, you have a +2 item bonus to saving throws against [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait") effects. Also, you can use a single action to breathe out a 20-foot cone of bitter vapor that causes an earth-shaking rumble that can be heard for 100 feet.

Creatures and objects in the area take `5d6` damage (DC 30 basic Fortitude save), decreasing Hardness by 5. An object's Hardness remains lowered for `1d4` rounds, and you can't use this breath again for the same amount of time.
