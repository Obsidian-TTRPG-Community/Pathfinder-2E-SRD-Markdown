# Skunk Bomb *Item 1+*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [bomb](rules/traits/bomb.md "Bomb Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [olfactory](rules/traits/olfactory-b1.md "Olfactory Effect Trait")  [poison](rules/traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait")  [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)

Skunk bombs are made from the concentrated odors of xulgaths, hezrous, and other creatures with natural or supernatural stench. The bomb grants an item bonus to attack rolls and deals poison damage and poison [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage. Any creature hit by the bomb or in its splash area must attempt a Fortitude saving throw with a DC based on the bomb's type. Creatures in the splash area treat the results of their saving throw as one step better.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
> - **Failure** The target is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) while [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round, [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened), and [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) while [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
>
>    Creatures [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) by the bomb emit an odor that lasts 10 minutes after the [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition ends (or 1 hour if they were also [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded)). The odor can be removed or neutralized by using prestidigitation or similar magic or by spending 10 minutes scrubbing with ample soap and water. While the odor lasts, creatures within 30 feet can smell the target, enabling even those with a weak sense of smell to detect its presence, and all creatures gain a +1 item bonus to [Track](rules/actions/track.md) the affected creature for as long as it has the odor. A creature that has imprecise or precise scent doubles the range at which it can detect the target using this scent.
