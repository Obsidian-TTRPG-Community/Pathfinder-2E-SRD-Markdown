Another complex gnome invention, the switchscythe is designed for versatility. The curved blade is partly hollow, containing a long rod of wood or metal; the rod can be pulled perpendicular to the blade, turning the switchscythe from a [sweeping](rules/traits/sweep.md), axe-like blade into a hooked pick capable of [grappling](rules/traits/grapple.md) a foe.
