# Spring-loaded Net Launcher *Item 2*  
[clockwork](rules/traits/clockwork-g-g.md "Clockwork  Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [gadget](rules/traits/gadget-g-g.md "Gadget  Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 6 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

This small bronze cylinder is about the size of a potion bottle. When you activate the launcher, it fires an unattached net requiring only a single hand, and at a greater distance. As normal, you make a ranged attack roll against a [Medium](rules/traits/medium-b1.md "Medium Size Trait") or smaller creature, but you can target a creature up to 60 feet away, instead of only 20 feet away. The net trap otherwise functions as an unattached [net](compendium/equipment/items/net-apg.md).
