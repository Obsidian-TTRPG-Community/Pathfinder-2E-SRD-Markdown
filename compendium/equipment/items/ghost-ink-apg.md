This pale-blue ink dries rapidly, becoming fully transparent 1 minute after application. The ink glows red when exposed to heat, such as that from a torch or other open flame. This glow lasts only as long as the ink is exposed to heat, after which the ink becomes [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) again. The crafter of the ghost ink can alter the formula slightly to instead make the ink sensitive to sunlight, starlight, magical light, or heatless light created by an [alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait") effect such as a sunrod.

While the text isn't glowing, a creature closely examining a surface marked with ghost ink can detect the presence of the ink with a successful DC 25 [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check. On a critical success, they can make out the ink well enough to use [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) to [Decipher Writing](rules/actions/decipher-writing.md). One vial of ghost ink is sufficient to write a page worth of text.
