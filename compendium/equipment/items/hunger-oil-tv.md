Rendered from the fat of corporeal undead creatures and infused with ghoulish magic, this yellowish oil causes its victims to experience stabbing hunger pangs that only living flesh can abate. If the victim eats at least a mouthful of humanoid flesh, it ignores the [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition from hunger oil for 1 minute.

Victims under the effect of hunger oil regain only half as many Hit Points from healing effects unless they've eaten at least a mouthful of humanoid flesh in the last minute.
