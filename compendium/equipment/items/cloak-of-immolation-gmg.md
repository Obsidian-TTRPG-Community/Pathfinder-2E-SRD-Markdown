# Cloak Of Immolation *Item 7*  
[cursed](rules/traits/cursed-gmg.md "Cursed Item Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn cloak

Appearing as a magic cloak such as a cloak of elvenkind, this garment is made of highly volatile fabric. While wearing it, if you take fire damage, you also take `1d10` [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). Taking fire damage while the [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) is in effect has no additional effect. You can extinguish the [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) as normal.

Any creature that hits you with a melee unarmed attack while you are taking this [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) takes fire damage equal to the [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) you took on your previous turn. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the boots fuse to you.
