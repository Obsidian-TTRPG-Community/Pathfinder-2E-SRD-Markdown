A bound guardian is a tattoo guardian (Pathfinder Bestiary 3 262) bonded to your skin, which you can temporarily animate to protect you. If your soul leaves your body, your tattoo guardian might be destroyed (see the sidebar, Bestiary 3 262).

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  

You animate your tattoo guardian, otherwise using the duration and other parameters of a 4th-level [summon construct](compendium/spells/summon-construct.md) spell. You can have the guardian [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md) Free as part of Activating your tattoo.

If your tattoo guardian drops to 0 HP, the activation ends, and the inanimate tattoo returns to your skin.
