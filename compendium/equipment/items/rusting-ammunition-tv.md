# Rusting Ammunition *Item 13+*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [force](rules/traits/force.md "Force Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Craft Requirements** Supply the saliva of a rust monster (Bestiary 283).
- **Ammunition** any
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

Rusting ammunition is made using a rust monster's saliva and, when activated, deals damage to objects or creatures primarily made of metal. The target takes [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) for a duration determined by the type of ammunition used. A creature that drops to 0 Hit Points while taking this [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) crumbles into fine powder; its gear remains. The ammunition's type determines the maximum amount of an object that's destroyed.
