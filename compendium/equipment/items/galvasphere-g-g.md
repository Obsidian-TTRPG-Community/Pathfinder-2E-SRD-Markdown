A galvasphere animates a corpse to motion via electricity, rather than necromancy. When you Activate the galvasphere by inserting it into an adjacent intact Medium or Small humanoid corpse, the corpse animates as a galvaheart zombie for 1 minute. The galvaheart zombie has the statistics of a zombie shambler except that it is a [construct](rules/traits/construct.md "Construct Creature Type Trait") instead of an [undead](rules/traits/undead.md "Undead Creature Type Trait"), isn't [evil](rules/traits/evil.md "Evil Alignment Trait"), can't be harmed by positive energy, and is the same size as the corpse (Medium or Small). The zombie is your [minion](rules/traits/minion.md "Minion Creature Trait") and performs the actions you choose when you [Command](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) it. If you don't [Command](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) it, it takes no action, twitching in place as the electricity that animates it slowly expends itself.
