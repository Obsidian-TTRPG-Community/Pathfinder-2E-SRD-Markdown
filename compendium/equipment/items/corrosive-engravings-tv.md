These tin sheets are bound in brass and show significant signs of erosion. The grimoire's title is acid-etched, and flipping between the sheets leaves your fingers covered in flecks of rust and powdery metal.

title: Activate [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action")

If your next action is to cast an acid or poison spell that deals [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), any creature who takes [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from the spell is also [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) until the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) ends. Using an action to retch can reduce the [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) value as normal, but it can't reduce the [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) value below 1 until the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) ends.
