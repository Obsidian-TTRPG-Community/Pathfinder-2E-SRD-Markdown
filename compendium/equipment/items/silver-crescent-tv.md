A piquant tamarind and chili-lime flavor infuses a silver crescent, which was first created to aid those battling the undead. For 1 hour, you shed cool, white light like a torch, and you gain an item bonus to saving throws against [olfactory](rules/traits/olfactory-b1.md "Olfactory Effect Trait") effects according to the crescent's type. While shedding this light, you can't be [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) if you're visible, and if you're [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), you're [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) instead rather than being [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected).

title: Secondary Effect [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

A ray of light descends on a 5-foot square of your choice within 120 feet. Any creature in that space takes positive damage with a basic Reflex save and is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until the end of its next turn on a failed save.

This is treated as silver for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like. The silver crescent becomes inert.
