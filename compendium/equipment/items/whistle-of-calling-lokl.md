A whistle of calling appears to be a simple brass whistle. It changes slightly in appearance depending on the type of creature to which it's attuned, depicting small carvings of hooves, feather patterns, claws, or other appropriate motifs.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [⏲](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency") 10 minute [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You blow the whistle at different tones in the presence of a companion or another allied creature willing to be your mount. At the end of the 10 minutes, the whistle is attuned to that creature.

The whistle can be attuned to only one creature at any time, but you can attune it to a new one with another 10-minute activation.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You blow the whistle and the creature to which it is attuned teleports instantly from as far as 1 mile away to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. The whistle has no effect if the attuned creature is dead, on another plane, or outside the range.
