# Demon Armor *Item 13*  
[divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [evil](rules/traits/evil.md "Evil Alignment Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Price** 2500 gp
- **Craft Requirements** You are evil; supply one casting of dimension door.
- **Bulk** 4; **Usage** worn armor

Crafted from black iron, this crude suit of +2 resilient full plate is designed to make you look like a horned demon, with your face peering out of the screaming maw of the beast.

While wearing the armor, you can attack with the helmet's horns. They are a martial melee weapon with the effects of a +2 weapon potency rune. They deal `2d8` piercing damage and have the [deadly <d12>](rules/traits/deadly-d12.md "Deadly Weapon Trait") trait. On a critical hit with the horns, the target must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save against the Abyssal plague disease (page 316). The horns can't be etched with any runes.

If you aren't evil, you're [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) and can't recover from this condition while wearing demon armor.
