Crafted from black iron, this crude suit of +2 resilient full plate is designed to make you look like a horned demon, with your face peering out of the screaming maw of the beast.

While wearing the armor, you can attack with the helmet's horns. They are a martial melee weapon with the effects of a +2 weapon potency rune. They deal `2d8` piercing damage and have the [deadly <d12>](rules/traits/deadly-d12.md "Deadly Weapon Trait") trait. On a critical hit with the horns, the target must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save against the Abyssal plague disease (page 316). The horns can't be etched with any runes.

If you aren't evil, you're [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) and can't recover from this condition while wearing demon armor.
