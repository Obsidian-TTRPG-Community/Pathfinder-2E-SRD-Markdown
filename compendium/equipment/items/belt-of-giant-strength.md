This thick leather belt is decorated with a buckle carved from glittering quartz in the shape of a fist. You gain a +3 item bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks and a +2 circumstance bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to lift a heavy object, [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md), and [Force Open](rules/actions/force-open.md). When you invest the belt, you either increase your Strength score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
