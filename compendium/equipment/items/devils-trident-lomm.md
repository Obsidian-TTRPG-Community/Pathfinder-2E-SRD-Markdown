The trident casts 3rd-level [quench](compendium/spells/quench-apg.md) with a DC of 25 and a counteract modifier of +15. You can [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) as normal.

title: Activate [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")

You call upon the corrupted power of the trident to stay a foe. Attempt a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). On a hit, the trident casts 3rd-level [paralyze](compendium/spells/paralyze.md) on the target (DC 25). If the Strike was a critical hit, the target is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) even if it critically succeeds at the save.
