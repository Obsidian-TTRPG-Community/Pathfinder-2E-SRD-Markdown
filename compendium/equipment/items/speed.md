- **Price** 10000 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a weapon

Attacks with a speed weapon are supernaturally swift. While wielding a speed weapon, you gain the [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) condition, but you can use the additional action granted only to make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the etched weapon.
