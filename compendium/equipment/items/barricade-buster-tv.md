Developed by a half-orc inventor from Alkenstar who brought the technology north to battle the Whispering Tyrant alongside the orc hordes of Belkzen, the barricade buster features eight barrels fixed around a central pivot attached to a handle and firing mechanism. A barricade buster fires spheres of metal with extreme velocity and very little accuracy.
