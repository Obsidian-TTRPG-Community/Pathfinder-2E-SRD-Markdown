# Shark Tooth Charm *Item 5*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 23 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** command; **Trigger** You attempt to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) using [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) for your roll, but you haven't rolled yet; **Requirements** You are an expert in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics).

This dried seaweed bracelet is lined with charms shaped like small shark teeth. When you activate the bracelet, if you roll a success on the triggering check, you get a critical success instead (if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead). If you fail the [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check against a grabbing creature, the creature must either release you as a free action or take `2d8` piercing damage as shark's teeth momentarily emerge from your skin.
