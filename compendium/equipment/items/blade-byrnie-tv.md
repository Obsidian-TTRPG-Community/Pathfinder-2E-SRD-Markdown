# Blade Byrnie *Item 7+*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** worn armor

Instead of chain links, this +1 chain shirt is assembled from metal "leaves" that each resemble a small blade.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You pull a link from the armor, which transforms into a +1 striking dagger. The dagger disappears and reappears as a link in the armor after you [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with it, or at the end of this turn if you don't make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). You can Activate the blade byrnie in place of an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to draw a weapon for abilities such as the Quick Draw feat.

Upgrading the runes on the blade byrnie makes the daggers pulled from it more powerful. The daggers have a +2 weapon potency rune if the armor has a +2 armor potency rune, or a +3 weapon potency rune if the armor has a +3 armor potency rune.
