# Chime of Opening *Item 6*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 235 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 2 hands

This hollow mithral tube is about a foot long and bears engravings reminiscent of open locks and [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) chains.

The chime can be activated 10 times before it cracks and becomes useless.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You aim the chime at a container, door, or lock you want to open and strike the chime. The chime sends out magical vibrations that attempt a [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check against the lock's DC, with a [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) bonus of +13. This targets only one lock or binding at a time, so you might need to activate the chime multiple times to open a target with several forms of protection.
```
