- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** held in 2 hands

The barrel of this long rifle is translucent in places, forming a swirled pattern along the metal, and its stock is formed of crimson wood. Ghosthand's Comet is a +4 major striking [beast‑bane](compendium/equipment/items/bane-som.md) greater impactful advanced firearm with a range increment of 300 feet. It deals `5d8` force damage and has the backstabber, concussive, kickback, and fatal d12 traits. As a star gun, Ghosthand's Comet runs on magic and doesn't use ammunition or black powder. The weapon is silent when fired.

- **Trigger**: You attempt a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with Ghosthand's Comet

**Effect** For the triggering [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), Ghosthand's Comet changes its damage type to your choice of acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.
```

title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") envision


On your next attempt at a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with Ghosthand's Comet, the shot phases through any material or magical obstacle, such as a wall of force, in its path, ignoring all cover. You must attempt the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) by the end of your turn or this effect is lost.

Destruction If the Grim Reaper slays the wielder of Ghosthand's Comet, the Reaper's scythe, as it strikes the killing blow, is destined to slice the star gun in half.
