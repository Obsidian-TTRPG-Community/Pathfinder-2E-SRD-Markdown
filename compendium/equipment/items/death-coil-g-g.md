# Death Coil *Item 20*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [snare](rules/traits/snare.md "Snare Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Price** 9000 gp

This modified Stasian coil of metal and glass stands about three feet tall. It activates when at least three creatures are within 20 feet of it, or if at least one creature stays within 20 feet of it for more than 1 round. It then lashes out with a torrent of electrical energy dealing `7d12` electricity damage to all creatures within 20 feet of it. Due to the fact that it doesn't trigger immediately when a creature enters its square, abilities like Surprise Snare (Advanced Player's Guide 194) don't work with a death coil. Creatures within that area must attempt a DC 43 Fortitude saving throw.

> [!success-degree]

> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
