# Dread Blindfold *Item 17*  
[emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Price** 15000 gp
- **Usage** worn eyepiece; **Bulk** â€”
- **Category** Worn

When tied over your eyes, this ragged strip of black linen gives you a +3 item bonus to [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks and [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md). You can see through the blindfold, but only using [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md).

The first time a particular creature sees you in a day, it must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or be [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened). This is an emotion, [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait"), and [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect, and your allies become immune to it after about a week.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action")

- **Trigger**: You damage a creature with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)

**Effect** Your target is gripped by intense fear. This has the effect of a DC 37 [phantasmal killer](compendium/spells/phantasmal-killer.md) spell, but it is an enchantment instead of an illusion. The creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.
