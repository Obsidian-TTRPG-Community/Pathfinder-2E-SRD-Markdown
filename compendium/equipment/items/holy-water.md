# Holy Water *Item 1*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [good](rules/traits/good.md "Good Alignment Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait")  

- **Price** 3 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)

This vial contains water blessed by a good deity. You activate a vial of holy water by throwing it as a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). It's a simple thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") trait to the attack made with it.

Holy water deals `1d6` good damage and 1 good splash damage. It damages only fiends, undead, and creatures that have a weakness to good damage.
