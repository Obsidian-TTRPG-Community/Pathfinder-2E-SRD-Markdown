# Mask of Uncanny Breath *Item 11*  
[focused](rules/traits/focused.md "Focused Item Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")  

- **Price** 1200 gp
- **Craft Requirements** You are a monk with occult ki spells.
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn mask

A thin wooden mask carved in the shape of a skull, monstrous face, or eerily featureless visage, a mask of uncanny breath fully covers your face. While wearing it, each breath you take feels cool and pure, perfectly flowing to feed your ki. You gain resistance 10 to inhaled poisons and can breathe in an airless or toxic environment. When you breathe in, fragments of bizarre knowledge flow through you, granting you a +2 item bonus to [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") command

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger**: Your unarmed [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) hits a creature that breathes

**Effect** The mask contorts and inhales, sucking breath from your target's lungs. The target falls [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) but doesn't fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) or drop what it's holding. It wakes up at the end of your turn if it hasn't been woken up already.
