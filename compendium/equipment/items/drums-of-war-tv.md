This handheld snare drum is adorned with garish scenes of battle and triumph. When played, no matter what rhythm, it always gives the impression of a marching beat, invoking armies on the move. While playing the drums, you gain a +1 item bonus to [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks and a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed.
