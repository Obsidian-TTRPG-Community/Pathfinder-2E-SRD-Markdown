Ooze ammunition is a capsule containing a sticky substance. If you hit a creature with activated ooze ammunition, it deals acid damage instead of its normal damage type, and the creature then takes the listed penalty to Speed and [persistent acid damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) until it ends the effects. On a critical hit, the creature is [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) for 1 round in addition to the other effects. The target can end the effects by Escaping the sticky foam. These [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) actions don't need to be consecutive, and other creatures can provide the actions, although doing so deals half the ammunition's [persistent acid damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to the assisting creature. A creature that ends the effect still takes the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) that turn.
