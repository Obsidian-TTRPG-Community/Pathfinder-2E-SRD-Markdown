An undead scourge is a +1 striking disrupting dagger with a bluish-white metal blade that emits a faint glow.

These used to be weapons of Pharasmin undead slayers only, but the slayers have since shared these daggers with the Knights of Lastwall.

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger**: You damage an undead creature with the undead scourge

**Effect** You disrupt the undead's connection to negative energy. For 1 minute, the undead damaged with the dagger can't be healed by negative energy unless the effect attempting to heal the undead first counteracts the undead scourge's effect, with a counteract level of 4 and DC of 25. Positive energy still has the usual effects on the undead.
