This bottle contains a shrunken hippogriff. When opened, the contents reconstitute into a Large effigy of a hippogriff. The hippogriff waits up to 1 round and allows two creatures to mount it, then Flies up to 65 feet and waits 1 more round to give the mounted creatures time to dismount. Creatures who are still mounted on the hippogriff when it dissolves fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) in the space where the hippogriff corpse ends its movement.
