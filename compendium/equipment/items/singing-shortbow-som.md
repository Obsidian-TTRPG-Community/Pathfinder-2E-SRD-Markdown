# Singing Shortbow *Item 14+*  
[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Held

Rather than a normal bowstring, this +2 greater striking [thundering](compendium/equipment/items/thundering.md) [composite shortbow](compendium/equipment/items/composite-shortbow.md) has a string made of animal gut, much like a musical instrument's. When you shoot the bow, it releases a soft musical noteâ€”sonorous if your aim is true and discordant if your shot goes off-target.

[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  

You sing, hum, or whistle a note, and your bow provides appropriate accompaniment. Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the bow. If it hits, the bow generates a [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") effect determined by the note you sung, which has the traits indicated in parentheses. This affects every creature in a 10-foot emanation from the creature you hit. As normal for an emanation, you choose whether the creature you hit is affected.

- **Song of Suffering** ([evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait"), [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait")) Each creature takes `3d10` sonic damage with a DC 31 basic Fortitude save.
