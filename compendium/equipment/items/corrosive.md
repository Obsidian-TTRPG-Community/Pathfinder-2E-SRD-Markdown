Acid sizzles across the surface of the weapon. When you hit with the weapon, add `1d6` acid damage to the damage dealt.

In addition, on a critical hit, the target's armor (if any) takes `3d6` acid damage (before applying Hardness); if the target has a shield raised, the shield takes this damage instead.
