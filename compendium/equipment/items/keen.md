- **Price** 3000 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a piercing or slashing melee weapon

The edges of a keen weapon are preternaturally sharp. Attacks with this weapon are a critical hit on a 19 on the die as long as that result is a success. This property has no effect on a 19 if the result would be a failure.
