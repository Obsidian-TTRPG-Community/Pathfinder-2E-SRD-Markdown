If you share drinks from a flask of fellowship as part of your [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) action, the drink that pours from the flask happens to be exactly what the target of your efforts would most like to have a dram or two ofâ€”wine, spirits, hot ginger tea, or ice cold water with lemon, for example. You gain a +1 item bonus on your [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check.

The GM can disallow the flask's use if it doesn't make sense in the moment for you to pull out a flask and start pouring, if drinks are inappropriate for the occasion, or if your target is absolutely not interested in sharing a drink with you. Drinks from the flask of fellowship are entirely social; they won't intoxicate anyone, nor alleviate serious thirst.
