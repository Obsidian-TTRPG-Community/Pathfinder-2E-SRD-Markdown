# Mechanical Torch *Item 1*  
[clockwork](rules/traits/clockwork-g-g.md "Clockwork  Trait")  

- **Price** 10 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

Powered by electricity, you can turn a mechanical torch on and off by toggling a lever on the torch with an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action. When active, the torch sheds bright light in either a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 40 feet) or a 40-foot cone (and dim light to the next 40 feet). Changing this area requires a single [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to flip a switch. The torch carries sufficient charge to operate for ten minutes.

You can recharge the torch in 1 minute via an integrated crank-charging mechanism, turning the clockwork gears and generating sparks to power the torch, though doing so requires two hands.
