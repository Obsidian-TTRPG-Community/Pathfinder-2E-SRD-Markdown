A socialite staff is designed as an ornate cane, its metal body glimmering with jewels and gold inlays. A sculpture carved from obsidian tops the head of the staff, its design depending on its wielder's taste. Common choices include birds, flowers, or family crests. While wielding a socialite staff, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on members of high society.
