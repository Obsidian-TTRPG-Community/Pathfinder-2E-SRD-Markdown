# Gyroscopic Stabilizer *Item 4*  
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 115 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** attached <to a two-handed firearm>
- **Category** Stabilizers

A gyroscopic stabilizer appears as a gold disk suspended within three rotating golden bands inside a gilded case, itself attached to a set of clamps. These clamps allow you to attach the gyroscopic stabilizer to any one-handed firearm as an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Requirements**: The gyroscopic stabilizer is attached to a one-handed firearm without the [fatal](rules/traits/fatal.md "Fatal Weapon Trait") or [fatal aim](rules/traits/fatal-aim-g-g.md "Fatal Aim Weapon Trait") traits

**Effect** The gyroscopic stabilizer begins spinning for 1 minute. While the gyroscopic stabilizer is spinning, the weapon it's attached to gains the fatal aim weapon trait (Pathfinder Guns & Gears 232) with a die one size larger than its damage die (maximum d12). This allows you to wield it in two hands to grant it the [fatal](rules/traits/fatal.md "Fatal Weapon Trait") trait.
