# Varisian Emblem *Item 3*  
[invested](rules/traits/invested.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  [tattoo](rules/traits/tattoo-lowg.md)  

- **Usage** tattooed on the body; **Bulk** â€”

These tattoos are created using designs and techniques from Varisian culture. Such tattoos often depict the Varisian rune for one of the seven schools of magic, but one might instead show a creature or celestial phenomenon associated with the school, depicted in traditional Varisian iconography.

The tattoo allows you to understand and speak Varisian. If you already know that language, you instead gain a +1 item bonus on [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks you make when speaking Varisian to someone who understands it.

Each description lists the school of each Varisian emblem, and the tattoo has the trait of that school. The spell the tattoo can cast is from its school. As with the Thassilonian magic that was once so prevalent in Varisia, these tattoos lack a symbol of divination.
