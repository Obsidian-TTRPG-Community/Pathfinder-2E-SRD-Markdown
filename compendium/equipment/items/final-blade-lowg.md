A [Large](rules/traits/large-b1.md "Large Size Trait") or smaller [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) or willing creature can be executed by a final blade.

As an artifact, a final blade cannot be harmed by any but a very specific means.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [‚è≤](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency")

You execute a creature [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) beneath the blade. The executed creature takes `11d10` slashing damage and must succeed at a DC 45 Fortitude save or be decapitated as though it suffered a critical hit with a natural 20 from a scythe.

The soul of a creature executed with a final blade is trapped, and the creature can't be returned to life through any means, even a miracle or similar magic. A final blade can hold any number of souls in this way, and they can be released only through a complex ritual known only to the Gray Gardeners or through the destruction of the final blade.
