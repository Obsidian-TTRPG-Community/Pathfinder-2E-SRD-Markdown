# Bomber's Saddle *Item 13*  
[companion](rules/traits/companion.md "Companion Item Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 2800 gp
- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** worn saddle

Developed by urdefhans for their skaveling mounts but quickly copied by other races' cavalry, this leather saddle is made from cave worm hide and is designed to fit a variety of flying steeds. In addition to a seat for the rider, the bomber's saddle has a bomb compartment situated underneath the mount. The compartment can hold up to six alchemical bombs of light or negligible Bulk.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You drop a single item from the saddle's compartment, which falls to the ground below. If the item is a bomb, make a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with it.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Requirements**: The saddle's compartment is loaded with two to six bombs

**Effect** You drop the saddle's entire payload, scattering the bombs below. Make a single ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against an AC of 10. The AC increases by 1 for every 5 feet above the target area you are. On a failure, the bombs fly away wildly and deal no damage. On a successful attack roll, the bombs fall and shatter, starting in the target area and moving in a line of 5-foot spaces up to 30 feet long for six bombs, one bomb per space. The bombs don't directly hit any creatures; instead, creatures take [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage from the bombs as usual, but combine the [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage from multiple overlapping bombs together before applying weaknesses or resistances.

Apply [any](rules/traits/any-b1.md "Any Alignment Trait") effects normally applied to [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage when throwing a bomb (such as the effects of the Calculated Splash feat).
