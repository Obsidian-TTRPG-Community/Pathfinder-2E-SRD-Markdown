If you put this large opalescent conch shell to your ear, you can hear the sound of the roaring sea crashing against the shore.

title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You can raise the conch to your lips and blow into it, letting out a long, rumbling note. For the next minute, you and all allies who were within 30 feet of you when you activated the conch gain a +2 item bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) and can breathe under water.
