[electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 60 gp

Sparks of crackling electricity arc from this warhammer, and the head thrums with distant thunder. Any hit with this hammer deals 1 extra electricity damage. You can use a special action while holding the hammer to transform the sparks into lightning bolts.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Electrify** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") ([concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md))


Until the end of your turn, the hammer deals `1d6` extra electricity damage instead of just 1. After you use this action, you can't use it again for 10 minutes.
