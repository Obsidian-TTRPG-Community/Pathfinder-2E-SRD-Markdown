- **Price** 160 gp
- **Usage** worn

This fanciful golden ring has an ornate band cast with delicate, swirling decorations and is inlaid with three bright-green emeralds. While wearing this ring, you gain a +10-foot item bonus to your Speed, but only when determining your overland movement per hour.

You refresh yourself from fatigue. For 10 minutes, you can ignore the penalties from the [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) condition. This does not remove the condition, it merely suppresses the penalties and drawbacks of having the condition. If something would cause you to become [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) again while the ring's power is in effect, the suppression ends, and you immediately take the penalties again.
