# Bone Dreadnought Plate *Item 10*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 1000 gp
- **Bulk** 5; **Usage** worn armor
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

This suit of bone-based [fortress plate](compendium/equipment/items/fortress-plate-tv.md) is a masterpiece of alchemical science. This armor has a receiver that can hold a single [lodestone bomb](compendium/equipment/items/lodestone-bomb-tv.md), which takes 3 [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions to install. A loaded suit of bone dreadnought plate can be activated to cause the bomb to shift numerous small plates and hinges, offering a wide variety of protections, granting you resistance to cold, electricity, fire, piercing, and slashing damage equal to the loaded lodestone bomb's splash damage. These effects last for 20 minutes, but each time you're hit by an attack that deals damage of one of these types, decrease the remaining duration by 1 minute. Once activated, the armor can't be deactivated. The armor uses up the lodestone bomb during the duration and can't be activated again until a new one is installed.
