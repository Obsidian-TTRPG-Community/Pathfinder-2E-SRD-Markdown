# Wondrous Figurine *Item 2+*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

Each one of these statuettes is 1 inch in height, carved from a specific material and taking the shape of a particular animal or animals.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You activate the statue by placing it on solid ground and then speaking its name, causing the statuette to transform into a living creature or creatures. In creature form, the figurine has the minion trait. It can understand your language and it obeys you to the best of its ability when you use an action to command it. The specifics of each creature, as well as the activation's frequency (if any), appear in its entry below.

If the figurine is slain while in animal form, it reverts to its statue shape and cannot be activated again until 1 week has passed. If the figurine is destroyed in statue form, it is shattered and its magic is lost.

### Variants

#### golden lions *Item 10*

- **Price**: 900 gp

This statuette depicts a pair of gold lions, and when activated, it becomes a pair of adult lions. The lions can be called on only once per day, and they remain in lion form for no more than 1 hour. If either of the lions is slain, that lion cannot be summoned again until 1 week has passed, but this doesn't prevent you from summoning the other.

#### jade serpent *Item 7*

- **Price**: 340 gp

This tiny statue first appears to be a formless lump of jade until closer inspection reveals it to be a serpentine body curled into a snug knot. When activated, this figurine becomes a giant viper. The figurine can be used only once per day, and it can remain in serpent form for no more than 10 minutes.

#### marble elephant *Item 13*

- **Price**: 2700 gp

Finely carved from a solid piece of marble, this gleaming elephant statuette becomes a fully grown elephant when activated. The elephant can be called upon no more than four times per month.

It remains for 24 hours as long as it is being used as a beast of burden or for transport. If it attempts an attack or otherwise engages in combat, it reverts to statuette form after `1d4` rounds.

#### obsidian steed *Item 15*

- **Price**: 6000 gp

This sinister-looking black statuette resembles a horse rearing up on its hind legs. When activated, this figurine becomes a nightmare. It can be called upon once per week for up to 24 hours, though it won't use plane shift or its other abilities on behalf of its rider. Although evil, it allows itself to be ridden by creatures of any alignment, although if a good creature mounts it, the rider must attempt a DC 3 flat check. On a failure, the nightmare uses plane shift to take the rider to a random location in the Abyss, where it promptly returns to statue form, stranding its rider in that nightmarish place.

#### onyx dog *Item 2*

- **Price**: 34 gp

This simple onyx statue transforms into a guard dog. The dog has a +4 circumstance bonus to [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) checks to [Track](rules/actions/track.md), and it has [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md).

When the dog senses a [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) creature with its scent, that creature is instead [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed) and [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed). The onyx dog can be activated once per week and remains in its form for up to 6 hours.
