# Bloodbane *Item 8*  
[dwarf](rules/traits/dwarf.md "Dwarf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Usage** etched onto a clan dagger

A _bloodbane_ clan dagger is especially vicious against the ancestral enemies of the clan. When you damage an appropriate type of creature with the weapon, that creature takes 1 [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). The type of creature depends on the clan that made the dagger, but is typically drow, duergar, giant, or orc.

In addition, whenever you inflict [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) with a _bloodbane_ weapon (whether from its innate ability or in some other way), the weapon leaves ragged wounds. The bleeding creature must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or become [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened). The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.
