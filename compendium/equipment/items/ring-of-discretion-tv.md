# Ring of Discretion *Item 1*  
[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Price** 15 gp
- **Bulk** —; **Usage** worn

A ring of discretion magically conceals any armor and sheathed weapons you're wearing by either turning them [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) or creating the illusion of ordinary clothes. The ring doesn't change your appearance beyond concealing weapons and armor. As soon as you wield a weapon affected by the ring, the weapon becomes obvious to onlookers and is no longer affected until you sheathe the weapon for at least 1 minute. A creature can use the [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) action to examine you and disbelieve this illusion (DC 15), and it can attempt to do so without using an action each time it hits you with an attack.
