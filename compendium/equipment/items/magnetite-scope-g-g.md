# Magnetite Scope *Item 9+*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** attached <to firearm (scope)>
- **Category** Scope

More of a field projector than a scope, this small cylinder of magnetite has been enchanted to spread and accelerate the shrapnel of a scatter weapon further than the weapon's natural capabilities. Furthermore, some of the floating magnetite inside the scope's structure can help you when attempting to determine the your allies' locations. The magnetite scope grants you a +2 item bonus to [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) checks to [Sense Direction](rules/actions/sense-direction.md) when using the scope to assist you in navigating. This scope can only be attached to firearms with the scatter trait.

The next [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) you make this round with the gun to which the scope is attached has its scatter radius increased by 5 feet.
