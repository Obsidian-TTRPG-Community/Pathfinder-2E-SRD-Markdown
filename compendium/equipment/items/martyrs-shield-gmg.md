A martyr's shield is a lesser sturdy shield imbued with the compassion of a devout champion of a righteous deity, like Iomedae or Vildeis, who sacrificed themself to save an ally. In addition to good-naturedly attempting to convert you to its religion, the martyr's shield can use 1 reaction each round that, when raised, it uses to [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) to protect an ally adjacent to you, with the effects of the [Shield Warden](compendium/feats/shield-warden-champion.md) feat. The martyr's shield uses this reaction whether you would prefer it did so or not. The martyr's shield can be upgraded to a stronger form of sturdy shield by paying the difference in cost between its current type of sturdy shield and the new type.
