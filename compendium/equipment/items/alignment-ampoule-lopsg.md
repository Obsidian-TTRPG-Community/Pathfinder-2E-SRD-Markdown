[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [bomb](rules/traits/bomb.md "Bomb Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This glass sphere is divided into four quarters, each of which contains a different material aligned with good, evil, chaos, or law, such as shavings from a holy relic or dried flowers that grew near a planar rift to the Abyss. When an alignment ampoule strikes a creature with a weakness to good, evil, chaos, or law, it deals the listed damage, which matches the creature's highest weakness. This damage is always based on the weaknesses of the initial target of the attack.

If a creature has multiple eligible weaknesses, randomly determine the damage type. An alignment ampoule has no effect against creatures that don't have a weakness to the ampoule's associated alignment types.
