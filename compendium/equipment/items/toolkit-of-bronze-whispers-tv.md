Sacred to the faith of [Brigh](compendium/setting/deities/brigh-logm.md), a toolkit of bronze whispers has been used with such devotion it has developed a consciousness and personality that can be a blessing to a partnered crafter. A toolkit of bronze whispers functions as a set of sterling artisan's tools. Such toolkits focus on new creations and enthusiastically suggest crafting techniques to wielders. A toolkit of bronze whispers knows common item formulas of its level or lower and any other formulas the GM chooses. It can teach these formulas. You must still spend the time to copy a formula before you can use it.
