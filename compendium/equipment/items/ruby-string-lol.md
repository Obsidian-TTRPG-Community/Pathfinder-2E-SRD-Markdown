The frayed threads from the rips and tears in Hao Jin's Tapestry still contain traces of the Ruby Phoenix's magic. Hao Jin has collected most of these loose strings, but others occasionally find these potent silk strands in unexpected places. A ruby string can fulfill the cost requirement for an 8th-level create demiplane ritual (Advanced Player's Guide 241). When used in this way, the ruby string negates the need for secondary casters, and you get a success for all secondary checks. Alternatively, you can activate it to create a smaller demiplane without requiring the ritual.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [‚è≤](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency") 8 hour envision, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You spin the thread to form a demiplane with the effects of a successful 8th-level create demiplane, but the space is a single 10-foot cube.
