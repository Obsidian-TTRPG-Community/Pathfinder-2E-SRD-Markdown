Opening this vial unleashes its destructive contents: a reconstituted Gargantuan purple worm. The worm has two functions; choose which one to use when you Activate the item. [Burrow](rules/actions/burrow.md) The worm Burrows up to 80 feet, leaving a tunnel behind it. It can burrow through solid stone, but if it does so it burrows 40 feet instead of 80 feet.

Eat The worm attempts to swallow a creature, crush it in its insides, then spit the creature out. The target must be within 15 feet, and it attempts a DC 30 Reflex save. If it fails, it takes `3d6+9` bludgeoning damage (doubled on a critical failure). The worm then spits the creature out to any empty space on the ground within 30 feet, causing the creature to take damage from a 20-foot fall.
