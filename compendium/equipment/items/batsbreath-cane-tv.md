- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** You strike the cane firmly against the ground, causing a pin within the brass tip to tap the crystals and emit a sonic pulse. The pulse reverberates in a 60-foot radius for the next minute, with the cane acting as an antenna to receive the echoes. For 1 minute, as long as you remain in the area and are holding the cane, you gain hearing as a precise sense.
