# Magnetic Shield *Item 5*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [aura](rules/traits/aura.md "Aura Combat Trait")  

- **Price** 130 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

Copper rings spiral around this steel shield. Twin electrical probes near the grip can socket into a jar of moderate (or higher leveled) bottled lightning, which takes 3 [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions to install. A loaded magnetic shield can be activated to convert it into an electromagnet. When an activated magnetic shield is raised, the circumstance bonus increases by 1 against attacks made with weapons primarily made of metal. If you use a Shield Block against a creature attacking you with such a weapon, you also gain a +1 item bonus to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) attempts against that weapon until the end of your next turn. The shield remains charged for 3 rounds, consuming the bottled lightning, and once the reaction has begun it can't be deactivated.
