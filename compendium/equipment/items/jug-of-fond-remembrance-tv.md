# Jug of Fond Remembrance *Item 4*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 75 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This large jug always seems to contain just enough of the holder's favorite alcohol to share with a friend. As long as you're holding the jug, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks. If you share a sip of the liquor from the jug with a creature, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your next [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) or [Request](rules/actions/request.md) something from that creature any time within the next month.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** You take a long swig on the jug and then [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about a creature you can see, with a +2 circumstance bonus to the check. If you fail but don't critically fail this check, you get a success instead. You're then [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 3 rounds.
