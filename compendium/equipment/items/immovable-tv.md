# Immovable *Item 12*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 1800 gp
- **Usage** etched onto armor

This rune utilizes magical principles used in an immovable rod (Core Rulebook 574).

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** Your armor anchors you in place, even defying gravity, rendering you [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) until you [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the Activation. While you're [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) in this way, you can be moved only if a creature succeeds at a DC 40 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Force Open](rules/actions/force-open.md) your armor. You can also be moved if 8,000 pounds of pressure are placed upon you, though this is likely fatal.
