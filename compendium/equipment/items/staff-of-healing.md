Made of smooth, white wood, this staff is capped at each end with a golden cross adorned with a multitude of ruby cabochons. A staff of healing grants an item bonus to the Hit Points you restore anytime you cast the [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) spell using your own spell slots or using charges from the staff.
