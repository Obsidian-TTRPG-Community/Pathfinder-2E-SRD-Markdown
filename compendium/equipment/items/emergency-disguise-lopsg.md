In Woodsedge Lodge, this thin red ribbon, typically worn around the neck, symbolizes the reach of Galt's soul-trapping guillotines, the infamous final blades. Each of these talismans stores a specific disguise, chosen at the time of its creation. When activated, the talisman applies a disguise to its wearer, allowing them to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) without taking the time to assemble a convincing disguise first. The components the disguise creates can appear to be worth up to 3 gp total.

The instant nature of the disguise leaves a few traces of its haphazard nature, imposing a –2 circumstance penalty on checks to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) using the disguise.

Wearers with the Quick Disguise feat don't take this penalty. Any objects created as a part of the disguise disappear after 24 hours or after you remove them.
