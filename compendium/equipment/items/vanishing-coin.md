This copper coin dangles from a leather strip strung through a hole drilled in the center. Until activated, the coin becomes [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) for a few seconds at random intervals every few minutes. When you activate the coin, it casts a 2nd-level [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md) spell on you, lasting until the end of your next turn.
