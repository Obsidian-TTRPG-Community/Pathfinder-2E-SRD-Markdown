# Shining Ammunition *Item 1*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 3 gp
- **Ammunition** any

A piece of shining ammunition gives off a faint glow. When shot, this ammunition sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) for 10 minutes. If it hits a target, it sticks, causing the target to shed light in the same radius. A creature can remove the ammunition with an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action, but the ammunition itself continues to glow for the rest of the duration or until destroyed.
