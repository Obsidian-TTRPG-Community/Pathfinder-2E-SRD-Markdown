This single-use pacification device consists of finely ground hot pepper loaded into a sealed, blowgun-style tube with a one-way valve and a range of 5 feet. To use it, the wielder must tear open the tube's seal as an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action, then spend another action to blow the hot pepper into an adjacent creature's face. These actions don't have to be taken in the same round. The target must attempt a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid inhaling the pepper or getting it in their eyes. On a failed save, the creature is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round and then [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round, [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened), and [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until it removes the [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition.
