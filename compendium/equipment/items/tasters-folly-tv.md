# Taster's Folly *Item 4*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md)  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md)  [ingested](rules/traits/ingested.md)  [poison](rules/traits/poison.md)  

- **Price** 20 gp
- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)
- **Category** Poison

Devised to bypass detection, a dose of taster's folly consists of two compounds that aren't mixed but placed in the contents of one meal. Each compound is harmless on its own. The DC to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about this poison from one of its components is 23 and attempts to use magic to detect the unmixed components require a successful DC 23 counteract check. The onset period begins only if a victim consumes both compounds during the same hour. If the two compounds mix prior to consumption, they become toxic and are detectable as such. The [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition can't be ended until the poison's effects end.
