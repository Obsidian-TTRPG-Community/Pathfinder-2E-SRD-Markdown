[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [fulu](rules/traits/fulu-som.md "Fulu Item Trait")  [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Usage** affixed to one undead creature
- **Duration** 1 round (or 4 rounds)
- **Category** Consumable

This classic fulu seals the negative energy within an undead, freezing it in its tracks. Upon affixing, the target undead must attempt a Will save or be [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 round.
