- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

This clear, tasteless tar causes the victim to emit waves of harmful mental energy that repel other creatures.

Desperate users might consume this poison to keep enemies at bay despite the poison's debilitating effects. While you're [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) from this poison, a creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of you or approaches within 10 feet of you must attempt a DC 35 Will saving throw. On a failure, the creature can't voluntarily move closer to you; this is a [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect. Once the approaching creature has attempted to save, it uses the same result for all saves from that dose of repulsion resin.

```ad-inline-affliction
