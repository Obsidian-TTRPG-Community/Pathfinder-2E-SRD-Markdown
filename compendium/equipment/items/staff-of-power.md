This staff of magically hardened wood is topped with a silver sculpture depicting magical runic symbols. When used as a weapon, a staff of power is a +2 greater striking staff.

Voluntarily destroying a staff of power unleashes an incredible blast of energy. When wielding the staff, you can [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to break it. This releases a 30-foot-burst magical explosion centered on the staff. This deals `2d8` force damage per charge remaining in the staff (DC 40 basic Reflex save)

You automatically critically fail your save. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage dies instantly; this is a [death](rules/traits/death.md) effect.
