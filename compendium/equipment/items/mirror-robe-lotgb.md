- **Requirements**: The mirror robe was last activated to divert attention away from you and you are [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) or [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by at least one foe

**Effect** You draw attention toward yourself. Choose one foe to which you were [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) or [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected). You reveal yourself to all, becoming [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed). The foe you chose diverts its attention to you, becoming [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to your allies until the beginning of your next turn. If you are [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) or otherwise can't become [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed), you can't use this activation.
