# Manacles Of Persuasion *Item 3*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access** follower of [Zon-Kuthon](compendium/setting/deities/zon-kuthon.md)
- **Price** 45 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** worn on wrists

These sturdy, average manacles are connected by a thick iron chain that is much heavier than its appearance suggests at a glance.

Followers of Zon-Kuthon sometimes employ manacles of persuasion against captured enemies and spies. When the manacles are locked around an [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) creature's wrists, they begin to sap the life out of the victim, dealing 2 negative damage per hour until the creature falls [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). The effect is nonlethal, so the damage doesn't cause the creature to become [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying).

While the creature is [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), the manacles deal no damage and allow the creature to recover Hit Points normally to a maximum of 10 Hit Points, at which point the manacles begin to deal damage once more. The manacles have no effect on a creature that is not [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized).
