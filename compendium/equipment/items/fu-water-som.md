This potion functions as a bottle of holy water. Like holy water, you throw it as a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). It's a simple thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait to the attack made with it.

You drink the fu water to counteract ailments within yourself. Attempt a counteract check with a +9 counteract modifier and a counteract level of 3 against one effect that imposes the [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused), [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened), or [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) condition. You are then [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
