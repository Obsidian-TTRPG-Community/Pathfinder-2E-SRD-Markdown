# Engulfing Snare *Item 14*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [snare](rules/traits/snare.md "Snare Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Price** 900 gp

You arrange a spiky cage of bones, particularly tough vegetation, or other material to spring up when disturbed.

The snare deals `9d8` piercing damage to the first creature to enter this square; that creature must attempt a DC 31 Reflex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is knocked aside by the snare's deployment, taking half damage, and is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the end of its next turn.
> - **Failure** The creature is captured by the cage, taking full damage and falling [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone). It is [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) while it remains within the cage. It can get free by Escaping (DC 31) or by destroying the cage (Hardness 5, HP 30, object immunities).
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes double damage.
