- **Craft Requirements** Supply 2 doses of giant wasp venom.

This snare is coated with giant wasp venom and tipped with needles, which deliver the venom to the first creature to enter the square. That creature takes `4d6` damage (DC 23 basic Reflex) and, on a failure, the creature is exposed to the giant wasp venom.
