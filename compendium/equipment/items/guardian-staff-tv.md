You raise the staff and choose an ally within 10 feet. A ruby-colored plane of force appears like a shield near the ally, granting them a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. If you use this action again, any creature you previously granted this bonus to loses it.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)


You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
