This silver signet ring changes to match the insignia of a lord or organization you serve (or your own face, if you serve no one else). It grants you a +2 item bonus to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks and lets you cast [message](compendium/spells/message.md) as an arcane innate spell at will.

The ring casts animal messenger to your specification. The animal is a magical creature that springs from the ring, and its appearance suits the iconography or heraldry of the lord or organization represented by the ring.
