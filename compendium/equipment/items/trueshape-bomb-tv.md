Concentrated wolfsbane and other anti-shapechanger reagents fill trueshape bombs. These bombs grant an item bonus to attack rolls and deal poison damage, [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and poison splash damage, according to their type. If the primary target is under the effects of a [morph](rules/traits/morph.md) or [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md) effect, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw at the bomb's listed DC, or else the effects end and the creature returns to its normal form. Targets taking [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from this bomb must succeed at another Fortitude saving throw at the same DC to change shape using a [morph](rules/traits/morph.md) or [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md) effect.

The [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) can last up to 1 minute.
