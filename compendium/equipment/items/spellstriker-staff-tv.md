# Spellstriker Staff *Item 7+*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [staff](rules/traits/staff.md "Staff Item Trait")  

- **Craft Requirements** You have the magus's [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) activity. Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

A spellstriker staff is wrought iron with gleaming arcane sigils etched into its surface and a sharp point at the bottom. Used as a weapon, the staff is a +1 striking shifting staff.

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger**: You use [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) with a non-cantrip spell and miss with the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)

**Effect** An explosion of magical energy—stored up for the [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md)—explodes out. All creatures in a 5-foot emanation take `1d6` damage per level of the spell, with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. This damage is the same type the spell would have dealt, and the activation gains that trait; if the spell would have dealt multiple types of damage, choose one of them. If the damage of the explosion is mental, the save is Will instead of Reflex.

You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
