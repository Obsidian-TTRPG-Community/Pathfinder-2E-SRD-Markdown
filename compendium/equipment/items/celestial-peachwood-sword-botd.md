From blade to pommel, this sword is carved from a branch of the now-extinct celestial peach tree. The blade of this +3 greater striking disrupting holy peachwood (page 20) shortsword has ancient runes that can permanently destroy the most powerful undeadâ€”if you are willing to pay the price. An undead creature of 12th level or lower that takes damage from a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the sword takes `10d6` positive damage (DC 35 basic Fortitude save). This damage is separate from the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) itself and isn't included in [any](rules/traits/any-b1.md) effect based on the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)'s damage.

- **Trigger**: You critically hit an undead creature with the celestial peachwood sword

**Effect** The creature must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or be destroyed. If the undead fails its saving throw and is destroyed, you suffer a backlash, taking `1d6` negative damage per level of the destroyed undead.
