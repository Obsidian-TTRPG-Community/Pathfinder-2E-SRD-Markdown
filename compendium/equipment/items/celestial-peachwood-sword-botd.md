# Celestial Peachwood Sword *Item 17*  
[good](rules/traits/good.md "Good Alignment Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [positive](rules/traits/positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 15000 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

From blade to pommel, this sword is carved from a branch of the now-extinct celestial peach tree. The blade of this +3 greater striking disrupting holy peachwood (page 20) shortsword has ancient runes that can permanently destroy the most powerful undeadâ€”if you are willing to pay the price. An undead creature of 12th level or lower that takes damage from a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the sword takes `10d6` positive damage (DC 35 basic Fortitude save). This damage is separate from the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) itself and isn't included in [any](rules/traits/any-b1.md "Any Alignment Trait") effect based on the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)'s damage.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") envision

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger**: You critically hit an undead creature with the celestial peachwood sword

**Effect** The creature must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or be destroyed. If the undead fails its saving throw and is destroyed, you suffer a backlash, taking `1d6` negative damage per level of the destroyed undead.
