This bright red-and-gold cape is often interlaced with glittery threads and serves as a distraction. While wearing the cape, you gain a +2 item bonus to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You cast [dimension door](compendium/spells/dimension-door.md). The space you leave and the one you appear in are filled with puffs of smoke that make anyone within [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) until they leave the smoke or the end of your next turn, at which point the smoke dissipates.

Strong winds immediately disperse the smoke.
