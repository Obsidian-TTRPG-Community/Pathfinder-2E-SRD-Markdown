- **Price** 55 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

The blade of this sickle is engraved to look like the curving feather of a particularly elaborate quill. The wooden handle has a pen nib at the base. You can use the _wordreaper_'s handle as an ink pen and it never runs out of ink.

title: **Activate** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You use the _wordreaper_ to inscribe the words "read by" and your name inside a non-magical literary work (such as a non-magical book, scroll, or play). You immediately gain cursory knowledge of the literary work as though you had skimmed it for 5 minutes.
