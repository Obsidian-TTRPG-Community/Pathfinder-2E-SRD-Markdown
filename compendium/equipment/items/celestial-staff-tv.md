Heavenly radiance shines from an active celestial staff, a golden staff capped with a pair of sculpted angel's wings. Used as a weapon, the staff is a +2 greater striking holy staff. While wielding a celestial staff, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that have the [evil](rules/traits/evil.md "Evil Alignment Trait") trait and effects created by evil creatures. When you prepare this staff, if you're evil, you become [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) until your next daily preparations.
