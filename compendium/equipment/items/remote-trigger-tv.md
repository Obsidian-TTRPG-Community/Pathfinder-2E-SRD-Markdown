# Remote Trigger *Item 5*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 125 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

This trigger array uses thunderstones and crystals to remotely detonate alchemical bombs through harmonic vibrations. When a switch on the trigger is flipped up, the remote trigger begins to emit infrasonic pulses that slowly build up over the course of 30 minutes in up to three alchemical bombs placed next to the trigger (the trigger can be left to attune during your daily preparations). You can later activate the trigger to detonate one or more of the attuned bombs as long as they're within 60 feet. Bombs detonated in this way deal their [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage as if they had missed a target in the square where they were triggered.
