# Greataxe *Item 0*  
[sweep](rules/traits/sweep.md "Sweep Weapon Trait")  

- **Price** 2 gp
- **Bulk** 2
  - **Damage**: `1d12` S
- **Hands** 2
- **Category** Martial; **Group** Axe 

This large battle axe is too heavy to wield with only one hand. Many greataxes incorporate two blades, and they are often "bearded," having a hook at the bottom to increase the strength of their chopping power.
