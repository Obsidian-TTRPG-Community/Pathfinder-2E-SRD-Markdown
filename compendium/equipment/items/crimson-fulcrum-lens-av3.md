This concave lens has a drifting crimson cloud resembling slowly swirling blood within it. While you have the Crimson Fulcrum Lens invested, you seethe with malevolent fury you can barely contain. You gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effects and a +2 item bonus to your melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) damage (this increases to a +4 item bonus to damage if the melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) is a jaws attack). You can also activate the lens in the following ways.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You grasp the Crimson Fulcrum Lens in one hand and make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that doesn't require that hand. The [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) deals an additional `1d8` precision damage (or `2d8` precision damage if you make a jaws [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)) and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")
[attack](rules/traits/attack.md "Attack Combat Trait")  [possession](rules/traits/possession.md "Possession Effect Trait")  

While grasping the lens, make a melee spell attack roll with a modifier of +18. On a hit, you force the splinter of [Nhimbaloth](compendium/setting/deities/nhimbaloth-logm.md)'s essence from the lens to possess the target. You're no longer invested in the lens, and the target gains the benefits as though it had invested the lens but can't activate the lens's other abilities. This effect is permanent, but it can be ended by [any](rules/traits/any-b1.md "Any Alignment Trait") effect that removes a [possession](rules/traits/possession.md "Possession Effect Trait") effect. The lens doesn't have any magical abilities until the [possession](rules/traits/possession.md "Possession Effect Trait") effect ends; when it does, the essence returns to the lens.
