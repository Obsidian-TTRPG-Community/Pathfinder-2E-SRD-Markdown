[Abraxas](compendium/setting/deities/abraxas-logm.md) teaches that an eye for an eye is the basis of law. This tattoo of a coiled viper provides a +1 item bonus to [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) checks.

[Abraxas](compendium/setting/deities/abraxas-logm.md) transforms the tattoo into a weapon of your vengeance. The vengeful arm crawls into your hand and becomes a retribution axe. You can use this activation again while holding the axe to revert the vengeful arm to a tattoo. Like other retribution axes, you can etch fundamental runes into the vengeful arm's retribution axe to increase its potency or to add striking.
