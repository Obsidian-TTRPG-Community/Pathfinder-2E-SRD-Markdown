This oil fills a weapon with cosmic power of an alignment. Each aligned oil is crafted to one alignment: chaos, evil, good, or law (such as a good-aligned oil). A weapon anointed with this oil gains the effects of the property rune matching its alignment: anarchic (chaos), axiomatic (law), holy (good), or unholy (evil)
