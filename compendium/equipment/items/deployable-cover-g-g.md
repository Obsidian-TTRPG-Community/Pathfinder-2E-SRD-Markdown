# Deployable Cover *Item 1+*  
[uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 2 hands

This thick mat of canvas, foliage, and wood is mounted on a tripod of flexible metal struts, folded into a batonlike shape, and clamped shut. You can rapidly deploy it on the ground with an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to create cover. Deployable cover is large enough to [Take Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md) behind, allowing you (and others) to gain standard cover when you use the [Take Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md) action. Before it can be used again, deployable cover must be carefully folded and clamped shut, which takes 1 minute.

### Variants

#### deployable cover *Item 1*

- **Price**: 15 gp

#### ballistic cover *Item 2*

- **Price**: 35 gp

Specially crafted to protect against bullet fire, a ballistic cover also works against other physical projectiles, such as arrows, bolts, and thrown weapons. While a creature has cover from [Taking Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md) behind a ballistic cover, it gains resistance 2 to piercing damage from ranged weapons and ranged unarmed attacks.
