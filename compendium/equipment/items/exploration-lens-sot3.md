An exploration lens is a magical glass lens designed for a bull's-eye lantern. When light from the lantern passes through the lens, it alters the light to make it easier to perform a common exploration activity with the lantern. You can find more information about exploration activities related to these lenses on page 496 of the Core Rulebook. Alternatively, an exploration lens can be installed in a wayfinder like an aeon stone. In this case, light (such as that from a lantern, torch, or [light](compendium/spells/light.md) spell) must still pass through the lens and you must hold the wayfinder in your hand for it to function.

There are several different types of exploration lens, each granting benefits with a different type of exploration activity.

Each type of lens is distinguishable from all the other types by holding it up to a bright light.
