# Tanglefoot Bag *Item 1+*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [bomb](rules/traits/bomb.md "Bomb Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

A tanglefoot bag is filled with sticky substances.

When you hit a creature with a tanglefoot bag, that creature takes a status penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute.

Many types of tanglefoot bag also grant an item bonus on attack rolls.

On a critical hit, a creature in contact with a solid surface becomes stuck to the surface and [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) for 1 round, and a creature flying via wings has its wings tangled, causing it to fall safely to the ground and become unable to [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md) again for 1 round. Tanglefoot bags are not effective when used on a creature that is in water.

The target can end any effects by [Escaping](rules/actions/escape.md) or spending a total of 3 [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions to carefully remove the sticky substances. These [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions don't have to be consecutive, and other creatures can provide the actions as well.
