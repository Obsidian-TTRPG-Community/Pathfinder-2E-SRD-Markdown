Made of a deep-brown rosewood, a spurned lute is adorned with carved flowers. The lute appears to be and functions as a virtuoso instrument. (Other spurned instruments exist, but the lute is the least rare.) This lute has a jealous streak, demanding total loyalty from its "partner" musician. After you play the lute for the first time, it fuses to you. If you go a day without using it to [Perform](rules/actions/perform.md), you become [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) until you next do so. After that, when you attempt a [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check using an instrument other than the lute, you take a â€“4 circumstance penalty to do so, and you must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or become [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 minute.
