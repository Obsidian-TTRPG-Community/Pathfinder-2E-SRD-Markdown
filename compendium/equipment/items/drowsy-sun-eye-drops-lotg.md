# Drowsy Sun Eye Drops *Item 3*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md)  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md)

- **Activate** [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md)

These drops are made from luminescent mushrooms and refined into eye drops, which simulates a creature's natural night vision. When you attempt a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check to [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md), you can draw and apply a dose of drowsy sun to your eyes as part of the same action, which grants you [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md) to a range of 30 feet for 1 round. If you do, your [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) action gains the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait, due to drawing and applying the eye drops.
