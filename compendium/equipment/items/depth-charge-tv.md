Carved with stylized images of water or aquatic life, depth charges that are fired underwater or at a submerged target function with their normal range increments and can hit no matter their normal damage type. This ammunition explodes if it hits a target underwater, dealing bludgeoning damage in a 20â€‘foot burst (basic Fortitude save) according to its type. This burst doesn't extend out of the water.
