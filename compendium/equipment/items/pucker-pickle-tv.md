Sharp and pungent, but tasty, pucker pickles were created by goblin alchemists working to avoid being eaten by larger creatures. For 1 hour after eating a pucker pickle, you smell slightly of pickle, but you have a horrendous taste. Once a creature hits you with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) using an attack that allows it to taste you, such as a jaws [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), it takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to further attacks against you that allow it to taste you, including attacks like Grappling or Tripping you using its jaws or Swallowing you Whole. Creatures, especially animals, often choose other targets after tasting you. Any creature that Engulfs you or Swallows you Whole is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened). If it spends an action retching to reduce the [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition, you can attempt to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) as a reaction.
