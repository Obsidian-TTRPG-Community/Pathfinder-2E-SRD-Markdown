# Heavy Power Suit *Item 0*  
[bulwark](rules/traits/bulwark.md "Bulwark Armor Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** 3
- **AC Bonus** +5; **Dex Cap** +1
- **Strength** 16; **Check Penalty** -2; **Speed Penalty** -10 ft.
- **Category** Heavy; **Group** Composite 

If your Strength score is at least 16, you remove the Speed penalty entirely instead of reducing it to â€“5 feet.

> [!pf2-note]
> This armor is exclusive to the Inventor class with the Armor innovation and the Heavy Construction breakthrough armor modification. While you may be able to wear this armor as a different class, everyone but the creator of the armor is untrained in it, even if they would normally be trained (or better) in heavy armor.
