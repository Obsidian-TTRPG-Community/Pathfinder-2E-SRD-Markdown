A sun sling is a small staff with a head of woven netting. The staff is small enough to hold in a single hand, making it useful for hit-and-run tactics, but once loaded with ammunition, it requires two hands to properly swing and fire. Sun slings use small metal bullets covered in sharp spikes known as sun shots.
