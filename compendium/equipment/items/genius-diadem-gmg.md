The genius diadem is a [diadem of intellect](compendium/equipment/items/diadem-of-intellect.md) that typically acts like an arrogant professor or mentor, often boasting that it is a certified greater intellect and far superior to your own intelligence, even after the benefits the diadem grants you. The genius diadem encourages you to learn things for yourself rather than actually attempting to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) for you, though you or your allies might be able to play on its arrogance using [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) to trick it into doing so. In addition to allowing you to activate it, the diadem can use the diadem of intellect's hypercognition activation with its own actions, though if it does so, the diadem gains the benefits instead of you. Only the diadem can use the following activation.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

The genius diadem casts 7th-level [feeblemind](compendium/spells/feeblemind.md).
