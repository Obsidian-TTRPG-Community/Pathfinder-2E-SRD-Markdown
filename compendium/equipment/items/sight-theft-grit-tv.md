This blackish grit seems to absorb light and resembles particularly dark flakes of black pepper. Infused with the [blindness](compendium/spells/blindness.md) spell, sight-theft grit causes the victim's sight to dim and then depart altogether. The [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) condition from this poison lasts for an additional 24 hours once the poison has run its course.
