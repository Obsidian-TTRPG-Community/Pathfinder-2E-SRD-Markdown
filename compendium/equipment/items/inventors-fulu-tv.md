# Inventor's Fulu *Item 6*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [fulu](rules/traits/fulu-som.md "Fulu Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 50 gp
- **Bulk** —; **Usage** affixed to an innovation
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You critically fail an action with the [unstable](rules/traits/unstable-g-g.md "Unstable  Trait") trait.

Some inventors in Tian Xia put fried snacks near their innovations, a charm to make devices behave as intended. The practice rubbed off on other inventors, who replaced the food with a drawing on an inventor's fulu. When you Activate the fulu, your critical failure becomes a failure, and you can spend just 1 minute to return your innovation to full functionality.

The fulu then burns up, and its effects end.
