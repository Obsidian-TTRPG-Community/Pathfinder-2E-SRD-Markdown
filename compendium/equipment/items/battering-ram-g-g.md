- **Bulk** 20; **Usage** portable, held in 12 hands

Simple but powerful, a battering ram is a full tree stripped of limbs with one end clad in iron, often shaped like a ram's head. Large handles are affixed to the sides so it can be hefted and carried by a crew.

### Variants

#### battering ram *Item 5*

- **Price**: 160 gp

#### covered battering ram *Item 6*

- **Price**: 250 gp

Though it has the same Ram activity as the basic battering ram, a covered battering ram is additionally suspended from a protective roof attached to large wheels. This gives the crew members greater cover against attacks from outside. The cover is on the left and right flank, but open on the front and rear to allow for operating the ram. The roof has AC 23, Hardness 12, HP 48, and BT 24. Breaking the roof doesn't affect the operation of the battering ram but eliminates the cover.
