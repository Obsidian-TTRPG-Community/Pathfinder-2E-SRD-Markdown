This golden ring has three diamonds set into its face.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") envision

- **Trigger**: You are targeted by a spell

**Effect** The ring replicates the effects of an 8th-level [spell turning](compendium/spells/spell-turning.md) with a counteract modifier of +35, possibly causing the triggering spell to reflect back on its caster. The ring can reflect no more than 9 total levels of spells per day. If you activate the ring to reflect a spell that would exceed this limit, the attempt fails, but the attempted usage of the ring does not count toward the daily limit.
