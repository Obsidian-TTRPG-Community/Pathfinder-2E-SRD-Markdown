Transparent crystals as hard as steel take the place of metal plates on this suit of +2 greater invisibility splint mail.

Also known as a coat of a thousand thoughts in Vudra and Jalmeray, where it was first developed by psychic warriors, it makes your mind an indomitable fortress. You gain resistance 5 to mental damage.

Whenever you use the armor to become [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), you also become psychically [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible). Each time you would be affected by an effect with the [mental](rules/traits/mental.md) trait while you are Lost & Found Wares.
