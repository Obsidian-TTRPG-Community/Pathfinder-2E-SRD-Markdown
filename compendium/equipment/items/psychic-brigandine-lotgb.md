# Psychic Brigandine *Item 13*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 3000 gp
- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** worn armor

Transparent crystals as hard as steel take the place of metal plates on this suit of +2 greater invisibility splint mail.

Also known as a coat of a thousand thoughts in Vudra and Jalmeray, where it was first developed by psychic warriors, it makes your mind an indomitable fortress. You gain resistance 5 to mental damage.

Whenever you use the armor to become [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), you also become psychically [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible). Each time you would be affected by an effect with the [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") trait while you are Lost & Found Wares.
