It's said that the pale blue light of this eldritch lantern shines from another dimension or even is linked, somehow, to the glow of a ghost when it is consumed by the Outer Goddess [Nhimbaloth](compendium/setting/deities/nhimbaloth-logm.md). A lantern of empty light is not intrinsically an evil item, though it remains a favored tool of those who would manipulate the minds of others for sinister reasons. It can be used as a normal bull's-eye lantern, but prolonged use tends to instill in the user a vague sense of being watched by unseen eyes.

title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You direct the lantern's light upon a single living creature within 60 feet. That creature must attempt a DC 20 Will save to resist the light's effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and realizes that you attempted to mentally influence them with the light.
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected but thinks the light was harmless, unless it knows the true nature of the lantern already.
> - **Failure** The creature becomes [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) by the lantern's light, and remains [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) as long as you Sustain the Activation, up to 10 minutes.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but you can Sustain the Activation for up to 1 hour. When the effect ends, the [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) creature remembers any events that took place while [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) only as indistinct, dream-like memories. Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md); Frequency once per day; Effect You direct the lantern's light upon a single incorporeal undead creature within 60 feet to siphon away some of the creature's essence, dealing `4d8` positive damage to the creature (DC 20 basic Will save).
