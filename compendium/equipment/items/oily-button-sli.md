# Oily Button *Item 5*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 30 gp
- **Usage** affixed to armor

A thin sheen of slick oil covers this gaudy button. When you activate the oily button, your attempts to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) your opponent of an item before the start of the opponent's next turn gain a +4 circumstance bonus instead of +2, and the â€“2 circumstance penalty to attacks with the item or other checks requiring a firm grasp on the item lasts until the end of its next turn or until it uses an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to adjust its grip.
