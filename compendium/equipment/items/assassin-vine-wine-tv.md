[Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) wine from assassin vine berries is a dangerous process, but the resulting ruby-red drink is rich and heady. Alchemical reagents added during fermentation concentrate the vine's connection to its environment and impart them onto the imbiber. For 1 minute after drinking a glass of assassin vine wine, you have tremorsense at a range of 30 feet.
