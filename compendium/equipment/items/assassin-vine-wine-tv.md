[Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) wine from assassin vine berries is a dangerous process, but the resulting ruby-red drink is rich and heady. Alchemical reagents added during fermentation concentrate the vine's connection to its environment and impart them onto the imbiber. For 1 minute after drinking a glass of assassin vine wine, you have tremorsense at a range of 30 feet.

### Variants

#### assassin vine wine *Item 9*

- **Price**: 130 gp

#### aged assassin vine wine *Item 12*

- **Price**: 350 gp

Assassin vine wine that has been aged for several years—or artificially aged with alchemy—develops both a greater complexity of flavor and a stronger connection to an assassin vine's bond with nature. When you drink the wine, vegetation in a 20-foot emanation around you begins to writhe, becoming difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.
