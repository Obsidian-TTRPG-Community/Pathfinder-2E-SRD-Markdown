# Mercurial Mantle *Item 18*  
[apex](rules/traits/apex.md "Apex Item Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 24000 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn cloak

This deep red cloak fits lightly about your shoulders, and the edges perpetually twitch slightly, as though caught in a breeze. The cloth feels smoother than silk, rippling and swaying like liquid when in motion. You feel a lively energy infusing your arms and legs. You gain a +3 item bonus to [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) and [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth), and a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against attacks from reactions triggered by your movement.

When you invest the cloak, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
