- **Usage** worn cloak; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Worn

Sewn from several long strips of luxurious brown and black silk, this cloak grants you a +2 item bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks as well as to [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) checks to [Maneuver in Flight](rules/actions/maneuver-in-flight.md). You can also use your feet to hang from any surface that can support your weight, without requiring any check, though you still must attempt [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md) in order to move around while inverted.

You can either transform the cloak into bat-like wings that grant you a fly Speed of 30 feet for 10 minutes, or have the cloak turn you into a bat by casting a 4th-level [pest form](compendium/spells/pest-form.md) spell on you.
