- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This fist-sized, 12-rayed black star sapphire is sacred to Yueral, the elven goddess of magic and jewels, and most accounts of its creation attribute its crafting to a circle of her worshippers. In addition to the abilities listed below, the gem functions as a portal key for Jewelgate at [Alseta](compendium/setting/deities/alseta-logm.md)'s Ring.

You touch the _Eye of the Wise_ to a gem worth at least 10 gp, whereupon the _Eye of the Wise_ assumes the appearance of the touched gemstone. While this connection is active, the carriers of the _Eye of the Wise_ and of the other gemstone can communicate telepathically with one another over any distance, as long as both are on the same plane.

This connection is [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) if the other gemstone is damaged, if the _Eye of the Wise_ becomes attuned to another gemstone, or if the bearer of the _Eye of the Wise_ [Dismisses](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the activation.

You hold the _Eye of the Wise_ up to your own eye and peer through it. The _Eye of the Wise_ grows transparent and grants you a +2 item bonus to attempts to [Decipher Writing](rules/actions/decipher-writing.md), [Disable a Device](rules/actions/disable-a-device.md), [Identify Magic](rules/actions/identify-magic.md), [Pick a Lock](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md), [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md), or [Sense Motive](rules/actions/sense-motive.md). You can [Sustain this activation](rules/actions/sustain-an-activation.md) as long as you hold the gem in place.
