# Cube of Nex *Item 25*  
[artifact](rules/traits/artifact-gmg.md "Artifact Item Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [unique](rules/traits/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait")  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand

The Cube of Nex acts as a [Lesser Cube of Nex](compendium/equipment/items/lesser-cube-of-nex-loil.md) except it suppresses all magic within 5 feet of it with the effects of a 10th-level antimagic field spell, instead of just one school. However, spells you cast and magic items you wield ignore the [antimagic field](compendium/spells/antimagic-field.md) from the Cube of Nex.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per minute

**Effect** A [cube of force](compendium/equipment/items/cube-of-force-loil.md) or [Lesser Cube of Nex](compendium/equipment/items/lesser-cube-of-nex-loil.md) within 60 feet of you becomes inert. It can't be Activated, any current activation ends, and any constant abilities it has cease to function.
