# Mind's Light Circlet *Item 11*  
[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [focused](rules/traits/focused.md "Focused Item Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait")  [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")  

- **Price** 1200 gp
- **Craft Requirements** You are a psychic.
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** worn headwear

Gemstones of many colors adorn the silver of a mind's light circlet. When you're charged with mental power, the jewels scintillate with light, with different gems resonating based on your emotions. If you have at least 1 Focus Point, the gems cast dim light in a 10-foot radius. When you amp a spell, the light increases to bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) until the start of your next turn.

You gain a +2 item bonus to [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) checks. You also gain the following amp, which you can apply to any of your psi cantrips that have a target or area, much like an amp gained from a feat (Pathfinder Dark Archive 10). Amp You transfer some of the magical luminescence from the mind's light circlet to one of the creatures. Choose a creature targeted by the spell or in its area. Until the start of your next turn, that creature sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) and can't be [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed). If the creature is [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), it's [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) while alight, rather than being [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected).
