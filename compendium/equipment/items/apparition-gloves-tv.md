# Apparition Gloves *Item 2*  
[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 25 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn gloves

This set of gloves translates whatever the wearer says into the signed version of that language by projecting a ghostly, translucent version of the wearer's hands in front of them. The apparition is a purely visual illusion used for communication, so it can't move on its own, nor can it hold or manipulate objects, or attack.
