This +2 resilient coral armor, often favored by allies of merfolk and aquatic elves, is made of living coral carefully harvested from the ocean depths. Legends speak of a variety of similar coral armors with distinct powers, but surface-dwellers know of reef heart as a magic armor that makes it easier for them to travel under the sea. Reef heart enables you to breathe underwater and gives you a swim Speed equal to half your land Speed.

You cast [coral eruption](compendium/spells/coral-eruption-som.md) (Pathfinder Secrets of Magic 96). If you conjure the coral underwater, it ceases dealing damage after 1 minute, but its duration is unlimited. If the magical coral remains in place for 1 year, it becomes non-magical coral from which a reef might grow.
