# Pact Of Blood-taking *Item 5*  
[contract](rules/traits/contract-lol.md "Contract Item Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Devil** barbazu; **Decipher Writing** [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society), [Warfare Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore)
- **Category** Contract

You negotiate for might and viciousness.

**Benefit** Your successful [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) with slashing and piercing melee weapons deal 1 [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). On a critical success, this [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) is equal to half your level.

**Payment** You regain half the normal number of Hit Points from resting (including Hit Points gained from long-term rest) and from any application of the [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) skill.

**Hidden Condition** The barbazu owns any weapons you find. No more often than once per month, the barbazu can demand a single weapon of its choice (often the best weapon in your possession). You are compelled to hand over the weapon immediately, without question.

**Termination Clause** The contract guarantees that you will not "be slain by the barbazu or by barbazu action." This wording is vague; if any barbazu kills you, or if you die from [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from any source, the contract is voided.
