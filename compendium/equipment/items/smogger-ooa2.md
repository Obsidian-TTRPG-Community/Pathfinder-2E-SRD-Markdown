# Smogger *Item 9*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 600 gp
- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** worn backpack

Some mutants savor the acrid smog of Alkenstar and the Gunworks. A smogger recreates this pollution by sucking in clean air and spewing it back out as pungent smog.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) ([poison](rules/traits/poison.md))

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** The smogger creates a 10-foot-radius emanation of smog centered on you, which moves with you. You and other creatures in the smog are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) while inside the smog, and other creatures are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to you and other creatures in the smog. A strong wind doesn't disperse the smog but reduces it to a 5-footradius emanation. A creature that must breathe that begins its turn inside of the smog can choose to hold its breath as a free action for the round, but if it doesn't, it becomes [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened). The smogger can maintain this effect for up to 1 minute, and the wearer of the smogger can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the effect.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) ([poison](rules/traits/poison.md))

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Requirements**: The smogger's above activation is in effect

**Effect** The smog created by the smogger thickens into a toxic element that burns the eyes, blisters flesh, and causes fits of coughing. All creatures in the smog cloud, including you, must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save—creatures that must breathe and aren't holding their breath take a –2 circumstance penalty to this save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
> - **Failure** The creature is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) (or increases their [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition value to 2 if it isn't holding its breath). The creature also takes `4d6` poison damage.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes `8d6` poison damage.
