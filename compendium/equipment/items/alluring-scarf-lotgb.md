You [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md). All creatures within 10 feet of you when you started the [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) must attempt a DC 24 Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) and must spend at least one of its actions on its next turn to move toward you. A [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) creature can attempt another Will save if you move more than 30 feet away from them, and as normal, acting [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) to a creature or its allies breaks fascination automatically. Creatures that critically failed their save don't receive further saves if you move more than 30 feet away, and acting [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) to such a creature's allies allows them to attempt another save, rather than automatically ending the fascination. You can Sustain the Activation for up to 1 minute.
