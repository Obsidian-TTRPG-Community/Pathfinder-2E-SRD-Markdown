# Alicorn Lance *Item 5*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 150 gp
- **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include a horn willingly gifted by a unicorn. In rare instances, an alicorn lance can be made with a forcibly taken horn. However this heinous act pollutes the horn's magic, causing it to glow with a sickly red light, deal evil damage instead of good damage, and make the unicorn spirit evoked in the charge to whinny visibly in pain.
- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This white +1 striking lance is made from the horn of a unicorn, willingly granted at the end of its lifetime. In addition to its normal damage, it deals 1 good damage on successful attacks.

You can make the lance glow like a torch or suppress its light by using an action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) ([magical](rules/traits/magical.md), [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md))

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** You evoke the spirit of the unicorn that donated the alicorn lance's horn, which you ride in a shining charge.

Move up to twice your Speed and make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the alicorn lance; you gain the effects of the lance's [jousting](rules/traits/jousting.md "Jousting Weapon Trait") trait on this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). If you were already mounted when you Activate the horn, the unicorn spirit takes shape around your steed, granting it a +10–foot status bonus to its Speed for the charge.
