This white +1 striking lance is made from the horn of a unicorn, willingly granted at the end of its lifetime. In addition to its normal damage, it deals 1 good damage on successful attacks.

You can make the lance glow like a torch or suppress its light by using an action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait.

[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

You evoke the spirit of the unicorn that donated the alicorn lance's horn, which you ride in a shining charge.

Move up to twice your Speed and make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the alicorn lance; you gain the effects of the lance's [jousting](rules/traits/jousting.md "Jousting Weapon Trait") trait on this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). If you were already mounted when you Activate the horn, the unicorn spirit takes shape around your steed, granting it a +10â€“foot status bonus to its Speed for the charge.
