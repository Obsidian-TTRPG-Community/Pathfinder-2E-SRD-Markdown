```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate

You cast [paralyze](compendium/spells/paralyze.md), electrocuting the target into immobility. Each target takes electricity damage at the start of its turns while it remains [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) or [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) due to the spell. The amount of damage depends on the wand's type.
