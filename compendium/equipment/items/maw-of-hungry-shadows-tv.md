Shadows swirl around this soot-black tome, swallowing up any light that touches them. A faint whispering emanates from the grimoire's pages when opened.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") envision

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger**: Your last action was to cast a spell prepared from this grimoire that has the [shadow](rules/traits/shadow.md "Shadow General Trait") trait

**Effect** Your shadow, and that of the tome, elongates and reaches hungrily for one foe within 30 feet, who must attempt a Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round and [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) as the shadows scrape across it.
> - **Failure** The creature is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 minute and [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) as the shadows seize it.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the shadows also pull the creature into the tome, teleporting it to the Shadow Plane.
