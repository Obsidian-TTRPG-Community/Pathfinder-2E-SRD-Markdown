This glistening oil has a green hue and tiny snake scales floating within. If you slather serpent oil on a Tiny object that is snakelike in shape, from a stick to a scarf, the object transforms into a viper, keeping some of the same colors and patterns of the original item. If placed on other objects, the oil fails and is wasted. This false snake has the [minion](rules/traits/minion.md "Minion Creature Trait") trait. It remains in snake form for 1 minute before returning to its object state. If slain, the item returns to its original form, unharmed.
