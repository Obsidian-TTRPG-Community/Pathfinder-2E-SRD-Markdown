- **Category** Contract

You tap into the fiendish ability to slip through space. When you [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), you gain a +3 item bonus to Armor Class against reactions triggered by your movement. Once per day, from any distance, Abrogail Thrune II can call on a provision in your Thrune contract as a single action, causing you to become [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 hour or until Abrogail releases you, whichever comes first.

You recite a subclause of your contract regarding change in venue. You cast [dimension door](compendium/spells/dimension-door.md). The space you leave and the one you appear in are filled with the scent of brimstone, dealing `2d6` evil damage to creatures adjacent to both spaces.
