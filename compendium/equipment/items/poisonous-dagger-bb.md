# Poisonous Dagger *Item 5*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [poison](rules/traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait")  

- **Price** 150 gp

This dagger has an image of a snake emblazoned on its blade. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with the dagger, magical fangs emerge and poison the target, dealing `1d4` [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
