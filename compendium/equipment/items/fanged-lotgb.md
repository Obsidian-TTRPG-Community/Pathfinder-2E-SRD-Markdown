- **Usage** etched onto a melee weapon

When etched with this rune, a weapon's hilt or haft becomes engraved with grooves that match the imprints of a wolf's teeth. By putting a fanged weapon in your mouth, you can transform into an animal.

You transform into a [Small](rules/traits/small-b1.md "Small Size Trait") or [Medium](rules/traits/medium-b1.md "Medium Size Trait") animal that wields the fanged weapon in its jaws; the animal matches the animal you are most closely associated with (a lizardfolk would turn into a lizard, a kitsune into a fox, a deer instinct barbarian into a deer, etc.) or a wolf if no specific animal is applicable. While in this form, you can attack with the fanged weapon even though you don't have any hands. However, you can attack only with the fanged weapon and you don't have hands or the ability to hold items. For effects dependent on how many hands you are using to hold the item, such as the [two-hand](rules/traits/two-hand.md "Two-Hand Weapon Trait") trait, you are holding the weapon in two hands. You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) this effect, and it ends automatically if you drop the fanged weapon (whether or not of your own volition).
