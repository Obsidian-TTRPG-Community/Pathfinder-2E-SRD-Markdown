# Dreamstone, Cursed *Item 9*  
[cursed](rules/traits/cursed-gmg.md "Cursed Item Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

A _dreamstone_ can become cursed if left exposed to creatures that corrupt sleep, generate nightmares, or otherwise prey on sleeping or dreaming victims via supernatural methods. A cursed _dreamstone_ seems to function as a normal _dreamstone_ until the bearer falls asleep or is forced to attempt a saving throw against a [sleep](rules/traits/sleep.md "Sleep Effect Trait") effect. At this point, the person carrying the _cursed dreamstone_ must attempt a DC 26 Will save to resist the curse's effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The character resists the curse entirely and experiences a vivid dream while sleeping that warms them of the nature of the _cursed dreamstone_.
> - **Success** The character resists the curse.
> - **Failure** As long as the cursed character possesses the stone, they are [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) whenever they wake from sleep, whether natural or magically induced, and they take a â€“2 item penalty to all saving throws against [sleep](rules/traits/sleep.md "Sleep Effect Trait") effects instead of gaining the normal bonus from a _dreamstone_.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, and whenever the bearer attempts a saving throw against a [sleep](rules/traits/sleep.md "Sleep Effect Trait") effect, they get the outcome that is one degree worse than the result of their saving throw.
