- **Price** 675 gp

This black leather wrist guard has a bright red gem on the inside of the wrist. Faint glyphs and words of domination in Infernal swim inside the gem. Your words become harsh and clipped when you have this magic item invested.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") command

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You exert your will over a mindless creature within 30 feet. If the target is a mindless creature of 3rd level or lower, it must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If you are a devil, the target uses an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target creature is [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 round as its responses are muddled by your commands.
> - **Failure** The creature is [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by you for 1 hour, although it doesn't follow commands that are obviously self-destructive.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is 1 day.
