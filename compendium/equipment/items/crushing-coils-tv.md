Made from constrictor snakeskin, the strips of this +1 leather armor wrap around you like an anaconda might wrap around its victim. The first time you roll a 1 on any attack roll or check after donning the armor, it fuses with you and constricts. It constricts anytime you roll a 1 on any attack roll or check thereafter. When the armor constricts, you're [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) for 1 round.

The armor wraps around you, allowing you to don it by the time the activation finishes.
