- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** worn armor

Made from constrictor snakeskin, the strips of this +1 leather armor wrap around you like an anaconda might wrap around its victim. The first time you roll a 1 on any attack roll or check after donning the armor, it fuses with you and constricts. It constricts anytime you roll a 1 on any attack roll or check thereafter. When the armor constricts, you're [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) for 1 round.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


The armor wraps around you, allowing you to don it by the time the activation finishes.
```
