# Nemesis Name *Item 9*  
[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [tattoo](rules/traits/tattoo-lowg.md "Tattoo Item Trait")  

- **Price** 650 gp
- **Bulk** —; **Usage** tattooed on the body

You want revenge badly enough that you tattoo your nemesis's name in a place you can easily see to remember your vow to settle the score. Anyone who sees the tattoo senses your hatred of the named being. Receiving a new nemesis name makes any you already have non-magical.

You gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls against the creature named on your tattoo, but this nemesis gains a +1 status bonus to damage rolls against you.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") command ([mental](rules/traits/mental.md))

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Requirements**: You can see your nemesis, and they're within 30 feet of you

**Effect** You focus your hatred into a mental scream. Your nemesis takes `3d6` mental damage, which they can resist with a basic DC 26 Will save. You take half as much damage as your nemesis does, and you can't reduce this damage in any way.
