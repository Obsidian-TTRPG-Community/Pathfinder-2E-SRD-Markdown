- **Requirements**: You're affected by chromatic armor created by the wand of chromatic burst

**Effect** Choose one color of the chromatic armor the wand created for you. The spell ends and light of that color flashes brightly in a 20-foot emanation. Creatures in the area take damage of the type associated with the color you chose, with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC; the amount of damage depends on the wand's type. This action has the trait corresponding to the damage type you chose.
