# Vaultbreaker's Harness *Item 6*  
[invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 230 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** worn backpack

This bulky leather harness has four pockets across the chest.

The pockets contain a set of infiltrator's thieves' tools, infiltrator picks, a levered crowbar, and a glass cutter. These items are magically bound to the harness; if they are more than 1 foot away from you, they disappear, then reappear in the harness at the next sunset. [Broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) or destroyed items similarly reappear, restored, in their proper pockets at sunset.

You cinch the harness to prepare for mischief. You gain a +1 item bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks and a +10-foot item bonus to your Speed for 1 minute.
