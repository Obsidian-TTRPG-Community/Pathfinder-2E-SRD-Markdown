title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You conjure a Medium guardian with the effects of the [spiritual guardian](compendium/spells/spiritual-guardian.md) spell, but it carries a shield instead of weapons and can't attack. The guardian appears in an unoccupied space next to an ally of your choice within range and uses the [Raise a Shield](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md) action, granting that ally a +2 circumstance bonus to AC until the beginning of your next turn or until your ally is no longer adjacent to the spiritual guardian.

Each time you Sustain the Activation, the guardian moves to the ally, as long as the ally remains within range, and Raises its Shield, granting its bonus again until the beginning of your next turn or until your ally is no longer adjacent to the spiritual guardian. When the ally receiving the AC bonus takes damage beyond the 10 that's redirected to the guardian, you can use a reaction to have the guardian reduce damage for your ally even more by interposing itself further. When it blocks damage in this way, it reduces the damage your ally takes by an additional 20 (for a total of 30 damage reduced), but Dismisses the guardian, immediately ending the activation.
