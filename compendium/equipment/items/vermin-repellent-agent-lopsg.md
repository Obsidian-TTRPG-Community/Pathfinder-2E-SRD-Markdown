This specialized cream serves as a repellent to stave off insects.

The repellent also binds with a number of common insect venoms, dulling the potency and giving the wearer's immune system a boost to resist venoms. Once applied to your skin, the repellent grants you an item bonus to Fortitude saving throws against poisons for 4 hours. In addition, any arthropods (insects, spiders, scorpions, crabs, and similar invertebrate animals) must attempt a Will save when attempting to attack you with a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), or with a swarm attack such as the spider swarm's swarming bites. The arthropod then becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.
