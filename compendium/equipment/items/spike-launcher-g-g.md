Built from the spiked tail of a manticore, a spike launcher is designed to launch large, spear-like projectiles. A spike launcher is a +1 striking weapon. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals `1d8` piercing damage. It has the backstabber, fatal aim d12, and kickback traits with a range increment of 120 feet and reload 2. It uses the critical specialization of the bow weapon group, rather than the firearm critical specialization.

title: **Activate** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) ([evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md), [magical](rules/traits/magical.md))

- **Requirements**: The spike launcher is loaded

**Effect** The spike launcher fires a volley of smaller spikes in a 10-foot burst centered anywhere within its range.

Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the spike launcher against each creature in the area. On a success, the spike causes the creature to take a â€“5-foot status penalty to their Speed.

On a critical success, the creature becomes [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) instead. In either case, the creature, or an adjacent creature, can use an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to remove the spike and end the penalty or [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) condition.
