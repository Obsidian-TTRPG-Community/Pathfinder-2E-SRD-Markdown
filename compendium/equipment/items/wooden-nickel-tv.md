# Wooden Nickel *Item 9*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Price** 130 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** envision

This rough wooden coin hangs from a string drilled through a hole at its center. When you Activate the wooden nickel, for 10 minutes, you can cause any object you touch of 2 Bulk or less to look, feel, and smell like valuables of a similar size crafted from a precious metal of your choice. A creature that touches or Interacts with an affected object can attempt a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check against your [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) DC to disbelieve the illusion, and a successful check against your [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) DC with [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) or an appropriate [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill will also reveal the item's true nature.

After 10 minutes have elapsed since you Activated the wooden nickel, all affected objects revert to their true form.
