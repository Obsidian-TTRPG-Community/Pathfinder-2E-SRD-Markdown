A colorful feather adorns an inquisitive quill, which never runs out of ink. Essentially a Tiny construct, an inquisitive quill can stand on its own when given a surface, balancing as it writes or stands. (Drawing a line gives it an effective Speed of 5 feet.) It has strong curiosity, eagerly writing any information offered to it, often acting as a scribe for its partner. The quill copies text and drawings it can see or transcribes dictation it hears. It writes at a rate that rivals that of an expert scribe.
