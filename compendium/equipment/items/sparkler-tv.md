A sparkler gives off colorful sparks, burning for 1 minute. It provides bright light in a 10-foot radius (and dim light for the next 10 feet). While the sparkler burns, you can use it as an improvised weapon, dealing 1 fire damage on a hit.

On a critical hit, you cause the target to become [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round.

You can touch a sparkler to a flammable object as part of the same [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action you use to Activate it or as an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action while the sparkler is already activated. If you do so, the sparkler can ignite flammable objects the way a tindertwig does.
