# Sparkler *Item 1*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access** Sparklers are common in Tian Xia and Vudra and can be Crafted by those who can specifically [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) fireworks (such as a fireworks technician; Guns & Gears 134).
- **Price** 4 sp
- **Bulk** —; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

A sparkler gives off colorful sparks, burning for 1 minute. It provides bright light in a 10-foot radius (and dim light for the next 10 feet). While the sparkler burns, you can use it as an improvised weapon, dealing 1 fire damage on a hit.

On a critical hit, you cause the target to become [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round.

You can touch a sparkler to a flammable object as part of the same [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action you use to Activate it or as an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action while the sparkler is already activated. If you do so, the sparkler can ignite flammable objects the way a tindertwig does.
