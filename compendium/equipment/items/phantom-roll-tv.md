A phantom roll contains vegetables, greens, and fine, clear noodles, all wrapped in transparent, edible starch paper and alchemically treated and laced with a tangy sauce. Upon eating the roll, you gain a +1 item bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks you attempt during the [Avoid Notice](rules/actions/avoid-notice.md) exploration activity. You can also [Avoid Notice](rules/actions/avoid-notice.md) at full Speed or combine it with [Investigate](rules/actions/investigate.md) or [Scout](rules/actions/scout.md) while moving at half Speed. These effects expire 24 hours after you eat the roll or when you make your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.
