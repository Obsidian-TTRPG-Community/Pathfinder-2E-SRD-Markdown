# Bleeding Spines Snare *Item 12*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [snare](rules/traits/snare.md "Snare Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Price** 320 gp

When a creature enters the square, spines covered in numerous jagged thorns protrude out to stab it, dealing `8d8` piercing damage and `2d8` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). The creature must attempt a DC 31 basic Reflex saving throw. After the initial trigger, the spines retract and protrude again repeatedly for 1 minute, forcing any creature that enters the space or ends its turn in the space to attempt a Reflex save against the spines' damage.
