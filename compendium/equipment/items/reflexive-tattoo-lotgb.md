# Reflexive Tattoo *Item 7*  
[invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [tattoo](rules/traits/tattoo-lowg.md "Tattoo Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 350 gp
- **Usage** tattoo

This subtle pattern of complex dots, sunbursts, and lines is difficult to make out, as it's a near match for the wearer's skin tone. Serving as a barrier facing inward, this tattoo prevents ostentatious expressions of spells that are internal to you, making them easier to hide.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) ([concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md), [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md), [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md))

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) of 2nd level or lower that affects or targets only you, you can hide that you're casting it.

This has the same effect as the Conceal Spell feat (Core Rulebook 210).
