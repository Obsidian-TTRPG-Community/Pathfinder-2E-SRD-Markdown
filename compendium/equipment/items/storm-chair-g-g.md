- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** You create a ball of electricity around the chair, surrounding it in a damaging aura of electricity and using electromagnetism to briefly levitate. For 1 minute, you gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed and adjacent creatures that hit you with a melee attack, as well as creatures that touch or hit you with an unarmed attack, take `2d6` electricity damage each time. As normal, this applies to creatures who choose to touch you, not when you touch or attack another creature.
