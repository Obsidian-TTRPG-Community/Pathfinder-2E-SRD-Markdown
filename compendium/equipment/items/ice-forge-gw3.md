While many of the magical wonders created by saumen kar have been destroyed, ice forges, while rare, still see use today among the few individuals who manage to discover and keep one of these portable treasures. When an ice forge isn't activated, it appears to be a small anvil carved from a lump of ice no larger than an apple. While in this state, the ice forge remains cold to the touch but doesn't melt in the presence of high temperatures. It can be used to chill a beverage in a small container, although those who venerate and respect these items' legacy would doubtless find this use to be insulting at best.
