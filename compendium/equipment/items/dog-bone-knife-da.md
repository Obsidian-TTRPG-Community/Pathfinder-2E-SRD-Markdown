# Dog-Bone Knife *Item 5*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 150 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

The blade of this +1 striking dagger is made from the thigh bone of a canine that died in the act of protecting its master. A werecreature or other creature willingly under the effects of a non-permanent [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait") effect damaged by a dog-bone knife must attempt a DC 19 Will save or immediately revert to its natural form—this has no effect on a creature unwillingly polymorphed. On a successful save, the creature is temporarily immune to this effect for 1 minute. Kushtakas and other creatures vulnerable to canines take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against this effect, and this weapon overcomes any resistance such creatures have to physical attacks.
