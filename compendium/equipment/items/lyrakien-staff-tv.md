# Lyrakien Staff *Item 6+*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [staff](rules/traits/staff.md "Staff Item Trait")  

- **Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

A crystalline sphere, swirling with constantly shifting constellations, sits atop a lyrakien staff, a silver shaft that sparkles with the gentle glow of starlight. Desnans first created the staves, inspired by the music- and freedom-loving lyrakien azatas, but these staves are popular with spellcasters of all faiths who like travel, art, or the stars. While wielding a lyrakien staff, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait") effects.

```ad-embed-ability

You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
