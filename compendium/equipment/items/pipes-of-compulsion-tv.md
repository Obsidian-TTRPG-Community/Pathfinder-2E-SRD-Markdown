These panpipes are made of what seems to be beat-up tin bound by frayed leather and look like they shouldn't function at all, but in skilled hands they emit a beautiful sound that beguiles the senses. While playing the pipes, you gain a +1 item bonus to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) and [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks.
