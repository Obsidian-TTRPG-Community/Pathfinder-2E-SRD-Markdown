- **Price** 3000 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in one hand

On Tekritanin holidays, children reenacted legendary battles of deities by playing with magical tops. Though the paint on this wooden top has long since faded, its magical runes once gleamed yellow-gold and fiery orange, evoking the color of the sky during a sandstorm. To set the top in motion, wind a string around its bottom and upward along its body, and then throw it while gripping the string.

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You throw the sandstorm top 10 feet away from you. For 1 minute, as it spins, the top generates a magical sandstorm in a 5-foot radius. Any creature that starts its turn in the area or moves into the area takes `4d6` slashing damage (DC 30 basic Reflex save). Additionally, a creature within the sandstorm must hold its breath or begin suffocating.
