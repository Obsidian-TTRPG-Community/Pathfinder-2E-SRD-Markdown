A common cutting tool, an adze resembles an axeâ€”but the cutting edge is horizontal, rather than vertical. The adze's shape makes it popular among wood workers, and grippli builders often use them to construct their treetop homes. The tool also serves as an effective weapon, due in part to the immense strength required to swing it.
