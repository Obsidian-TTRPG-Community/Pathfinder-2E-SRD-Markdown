# Blood Booster *Item 3+*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [elixir](rules/traits/elixir.md "Elixir Item Trait")  [healing](rules/traits/healing.md "Healing Effect Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

This elixir bolsters your body's natural defenses and ability to resist maladies that travel through or affect blood. For 10 minutes you receive the listed resistance to [persistent bleed](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and you lower the DC for any flat checks to end [persistent bleed](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) or [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) as if you received particularly appropriate aid.

At the GM's discretion, blood booster elixirs can also automatically counteract non-magical effects that specifically rely on thinning the drinker's blood, such as a skull peeler's (Bestiary 3 243) anticoagulant.
