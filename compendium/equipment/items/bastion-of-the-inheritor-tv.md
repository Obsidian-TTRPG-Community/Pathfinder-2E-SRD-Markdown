Worn by [Iomedae](compendium/setting/deities/iomedae.md)'s prestigious knights, this +2 resilient bastion plate is emblazoned with the Inheritor's religious symbol and sports a white cloak. While the cloak is white, this armor grants you a +2 item bonus to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md), provided your target has no enmity toward [Iomedae](compendium/setting/deities/iomedae.md).

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

The armor's cloak becomes red for 1 minute. As long as the cloak is red, you gain the benefits of the armor's deflect melee trait without needing to spend an additional action to activate it during each turn.
