# Injection Reservoir *Item 1*  
[adjustment](rules/traits/adjustment-lotgb.md "Adjustment  Trait")  [alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 10 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** applied to a non-injection melee weapon that deals piercing damage; Bulk L

This reservoir and spring-loaded needle can be attached to a weapon to let it inject deadly poisons. Additionally, the reservoir can be filled with an injury poison. Immediately after a successful attack with the adjusted weapon, you can inject the target with the loaded poison by activating the reservoir with an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action. Refilling the reservoir with a new poison requires 3 [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions and uses both hands.

Adding an injection reservoir to a weapon throws off its balance, causing the multiple attack penalty with the weapon to be one greater than usual (usually –6 on a second attack and –11 on a third; or –5 and –10 with an agile weapon).
