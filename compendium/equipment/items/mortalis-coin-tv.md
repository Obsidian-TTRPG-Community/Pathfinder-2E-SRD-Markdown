# Mortalis Coin *Item 4*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 20 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You are reduced to 0 Hit Points by damage but not immediately killed; **Requirements** You are an expert in Fortitude saves.

This small golden coin is usually stamped with the image of a boar or other resilient creature. If the triggering damage would cause you to become [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) (typically due to a critical hit or your critical failure), you become [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) instead. In addition, for 10 minutes, you die from the [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition at [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying), rather than [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying).
