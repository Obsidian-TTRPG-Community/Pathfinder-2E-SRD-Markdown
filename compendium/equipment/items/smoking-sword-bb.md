Smoke constantly belches from this longsword. Any hit with this sword deals 1 extra fire damage. You can use a special action while holding the sword to command the blade's edges to light on fire.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Stoke Flames** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") ([concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md))


Until the end of your turn, the blade deals `1d6` extra fire damage instead of just 1. After you use this action, you can't use it again for 10 minutes.
