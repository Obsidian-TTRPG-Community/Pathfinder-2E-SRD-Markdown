The carved talon of an unidentifiable beast comprises this wand. Blood-stained cloth wraps the thicker part of the talon, which acts as a handle.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day, plus overcharge

**Effect** You cast 4th-level [sleep](compendium/spells/sleep.md), but the slumbering creatures have terrifying nightmares. A creature knocked [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) by this spell takes `1d6` [persistent mental damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). This damage wakes the creature from unconsciousness only if it deals 4 or more damage on a single roll. If the creature awakens from its unconsciousness due to damage (whether it was the [persistent mental damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) or not), it's [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened). If it awakens from damage on its own turn, the creature doesn't reduce its [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition automatically on that turn.
