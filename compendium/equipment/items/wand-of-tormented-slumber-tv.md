title: Activate

You cast 4th-level [sleep](compendium/spells/sleep.md), but the slumbering creatures have terrifying nightmares. A creature knocked [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) by this spell takes `1d6` [persistent mental damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). This damage wakes the creature from unconsciousness only if it deals 4 or more damage on a single roll. If the creature awakens from its unconsciousness due to damage (whether it was the [persistent mental damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) or not), it's [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened). If it awakens from damage on its own turn, the creature doesn't reduce its [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition automatically on that turn.
