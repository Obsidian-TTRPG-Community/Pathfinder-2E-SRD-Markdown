Jezails are simple, efficient long guns developed in Casmaron that typically feature a custom stock and a flintlock firing mechanism. Though lacking the range and stopping power of an arquebus or the raw force of a harmona gun, the jezail is an elegant, well-balanced weapon suitable for a variety of combat situations. It's even possible to tuck it under one arm to fire a less accurate attack that uses only one hand.
