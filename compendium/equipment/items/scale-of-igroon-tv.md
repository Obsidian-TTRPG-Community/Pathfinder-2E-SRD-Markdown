Carved from a scale of the kaiju Igroon, this jagged shield refracts light around it in a shimmering haze. A scale of Igroon (Hardness 20, HP 160, BT 80) recovers 4 Hit Points at the start of its wielder's turn. When you [Raise a Shield](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md), you can use the Shield Block reaction with the scale of Igroon to block an attack or effect that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, or sonic damage as well as physical damage.
