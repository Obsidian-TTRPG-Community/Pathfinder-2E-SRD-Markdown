# Scale of Igroon *Item 21*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [artifact](rules/traits/artifact-gmg.md "Artifact Item Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

Carved from a scale of the kaiju Igroon, this jagged shield refracts light around it in a shimmering haze. A scale of Igroon (Hardness 20, HP 160, BT 80) recovers 4 Hit Points at the start of its wielder's turn. When you [Raise a Shield](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md), you can use the Shield Block reaction with the scale of Igroon to block an attack or effect that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, or sonic damage as well as physical damage.

- **Requirements**: You're in an area of bright or dim light

**Effect** You angle the shield to refract light.

Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +4 item bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) and [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md) and can do so while [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed). This bonus ends if you Activate another ability or use the Shield Block reaction.

- **Trigger**: You use Shield Block and prevent yourself from taking energy damage from a line, ray, or a direct attack, including a [magic missile](compendium/spells/magic-missile.md) spell

**Effect** You reflect the energy along a trajectory you choose. The effect travels only up to its remaining range, using its original parameters if it strikes other targets.

Destruction If a deity, kaiju, spawn of a deity, titan, or being of similar power stomps on a scale of Igroon while in absolute darkness, the shield is destroyed permanently.
