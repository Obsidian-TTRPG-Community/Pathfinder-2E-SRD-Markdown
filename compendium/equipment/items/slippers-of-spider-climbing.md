These soft slippers are made of fine gray silk. If the slippers are left unattended for a while, they tend to attract spiders that nest inside.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") command

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** Tiny, hairlike tendrils extend from the slippers' soles, allowing you to walk on vertical surfaces or even to move upside down along ceilings. For 1 minute, you gain a 20-foot climb Speed and you don't need to use your hands to [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md). However, the slippers require decent traction for you to walk on a wall, so they provide no benefit when you're moving across greased, icy, or oiled surfaces.
