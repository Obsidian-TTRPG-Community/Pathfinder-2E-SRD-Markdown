# Silencing Ammunition *Item 9*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 125 gp
- **Ammunition** arrow, bolt
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

Silencing ammunition is particularly dense and seems to dampen sounds around it. On a successful [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), an activated piece of silencing ammunition creates a 2nd-level [silence](compendium/spells/silence.md) effect on the target. The target can resist the effects of the ammunition with a successful DC 25 Will save, though it takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty if the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) was a critical hit. While the effect is active, the target can use an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to try to tug out the arrow or bolt and end the effect early; this requires a successful DC 25 Will save.
