# Pocket Watch *Item 2*  
[uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 25 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This timepiece is a marvel of clockwork and miniaturization; its gears, arbor, and mainspring are immaculately crafted and tuned to maximize precision and reduce time loss. This pocket watch has the properties of a clockwork dial, except it has a maximum duration of 24 hours and is available to characters from Alkenstar.
