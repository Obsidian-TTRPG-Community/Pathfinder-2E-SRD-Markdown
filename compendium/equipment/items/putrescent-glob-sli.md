[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 65 gp
- **Usage** affixed to a weapon
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You damage a creature that is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) using the affixed weapon; **Requirements** You are an expert with the affixed weapon.

This repulsive, hairy glob dangles from the end of your weapon. When you activate the putrescent glob, the creature you damaged must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or its [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition increases to [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened), and it can't reduce its [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition until the end of its next turn. On a critical failure, it's also [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) until the end of its next turn.
