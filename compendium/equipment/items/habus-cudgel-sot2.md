# Habu's Cudgel *Item 8*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [unique](rules/traits/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 415 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

Long associated with a notorious crime boss in Nantambu, this stout +1 striking [fearsome](compendium/equipment/items/fearsome-apg.md) club is studded with vicious-looking knobs of obsidian and wrapped in cloth for a better grip.

It emits a ghastly groan when swung.

You gesture at a square within 40 feet with Habu's Cudgel. The club causes a frightful wail to unleash from that square and casts fear (DC 24 Will save) targeting the creature in that square and all adjacent creatures.
