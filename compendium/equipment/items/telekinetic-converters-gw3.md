Copper cables run from these thick leather gloves to nodes that attach to the wearer's temples, allowing a spellcaster to convert the magic they normally cast to pure psychic intention. When you [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) using the telekinetic converters, you substitute any verbal spellcasting components for mental components of simple thought, granting the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait to the spell you're casting.

You cast your choice of telekinetic haul or [telekinetic maneuver](compendium/spells/telekinetic-maneuver.md) as a 5th-level occult spell, consuming one of your unexpended spell slots of the same level as if you had used it to cast the spell.
