Sparks flash within this amber syrup. Drinking this potion turns you into a living lightning rod for 1 minute, drawing nearby electricity to strike you instead of allies. You gain the following reaction while the effect lasts.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Divert Lightning** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") command ([electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md))

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Requirements**: You aren't immune to electricity

**Effect** A creature within 30 feet of you is targeted by an [electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait") effect or is in the area of an [electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait") effect. Effect You draw the electricity to yourself like a lightning rod in order to shield the target. If the triggering effect was targeted, it targets you instead of the triggering creature. If it was an area effect, it leaps from the triggering creature's space to fill your space instead.

This doesn't divert lightning from any other creatures targeted by or in the area of the lightning. You're automatically hit by or automatically fail your save against the effect. You then can't Divert Lightning for `1d4` rounds.
