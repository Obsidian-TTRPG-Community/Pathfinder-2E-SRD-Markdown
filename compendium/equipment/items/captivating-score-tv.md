A captivating score is a piece of parchment prepared for musical notation, long enough for a short song. You must be trained in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) to properly compose this missive (or trained in an appropriate [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill your GM allows). You choose one of the emotions described below and write a musical composition to convey that emotion about a subject of your choice, typically a person or group. When activated, the missive plays a note‑perfect rendition of the inscribed score.

Each creature that can hear the score must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be influenced to feel the emotion you chose toward the subject of your composition. This lasts for 1 hour, typically returning the creature to its initial attitude unless new events have altered their attitude long‑term.

- Positive Your song engenders sympathy, adoration, joy, or a similar emotion. An affected creature's attitude toward the subject improves by one step, such as from [indifferent](rules/conditions.md#Indifferent) to [friendly](rules/conditions.md#Friendly).
- Negative Your song spurs anger, sadness, jealousy, or a similar emotion. An affected creature's attitude toward the subject worsens by one step, such as from [indifferent](rules/conditions.md#Indifferent) to [unfriendly](rules/conditions.md#Unfriendly). When composing this missive, you can add a small notation or illustration of a type of instrument. If you do, the music sounds like that instrument, and if you didn't specify, it sounds vaguely like a recorder. The choice of a louder instrument doesn't make the music carry farther.
