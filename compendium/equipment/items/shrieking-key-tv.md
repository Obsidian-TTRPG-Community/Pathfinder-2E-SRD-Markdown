# Shrieking Key *Item 5*

- **Bulk** —; **Usage** held in 1 hand

A skull-topped metal shrieking key appears to be a skeleton key, useful in place of thieves' tools when attempting to [Pick a Lock](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md). A shrieking key has no activation, however. When you use it to [Pick a Lock](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md), the key emits a loud shriek audible for 500 feet despite ambient noise. Physical barriers still block or muffle the shriek as normal. You also take a –2 circumstance penalty to the [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check rather than enjoying a bonus. After you attempt such a check with the key the first time, it fuses to you, returning to your possession if discarded. To use another device to [Pick a Lock](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md), you must first succeed at a DC 20 Will save.
