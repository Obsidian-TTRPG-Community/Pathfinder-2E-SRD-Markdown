# Kaiju Fulu *Item 13*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [fulu](rules/traits/fulu-som.md "Fulu Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 500 gp
- **Bulk** —; **Usage** affixed to a load‑bearing wall or pillar

Despite the name, a kaiju fulu protects a building against damage of all sorts. When an affixed structure no larger than 100 feet × 100 feet and up to 50 feet tall takes damage, the structure is as hard as standard‑grade adamantine against that damage and any damage that occurs within 1 hour thereafter.

The fulu then crumbles to dust, and its effects end.
