Despite the name, a kaiju fulu protects a building against damage of all sorts. When an affixed structure no larger than 100 feet × 100 feet and up to 50 feet tall takes damage, the structure is as hard as standard‑grade adamantine against that damage and any damage that occurs within 1 hour thereafter.

The fulu then crumbles to dust, and its effects end.
