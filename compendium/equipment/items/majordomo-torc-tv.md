[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [intelligent](rules/traits/intelligent-gmg.md "Intelligent Item Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn

Forged in platinum, a majordomo torc is engraved with heraldic insignias along with one language's alphabet, much like a choker of elocution. You gain a +1 item bonus to [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) checks and the ability to understand, speak, and write the torc's language. Your excellent elocution reduces the DC of the flat check to perform an auditory action while [deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened) from 5 to 3.

Upon being invested, the torc appoints itself your majordomo and, given the chance, takes over coordinating your social calendar, engagements, and wardrobe. A majordomo torc has a prim, fussy disposition, and although it defers to you, it can grow sardonic if you frequently ignore its advice. The torc has the following activation.

```ad-embed-ability

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** The majordomo torc casts befitting attire (Secrets of Magic 90) on you, usually to your specifications. However the torc can also choose the appearance of the illusion for you.
