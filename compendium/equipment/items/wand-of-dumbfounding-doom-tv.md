# Wand of Dumbfounding Doom *Item 8+*  
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait")  [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [prediction](rules/traits/prediction.md "Prediction Effect Trait")  [wand](rules/traits/wand.md "Wand Item Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

Carvings of skulls, monsters, and all manner of violence decorate this wand of blackened bone, but it makes absurd sounds when Activated, such as a honking horn, a manic giggle, or a daydreamy sigh.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day, plus overcharge

**Effect** You cast [impending doom](compendium/spells/impending-doom-som.md) (Secrets of Magic 110) of the indicated level, showing the target a potential death that's gruesome and absurd. If the target becomes [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) by the spell, it also becomes [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) with a value 1 higher than the [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) value. This lasts for the duration of the spell.
