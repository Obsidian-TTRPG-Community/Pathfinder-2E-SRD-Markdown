# False Manacles *Item 0*  
[uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 10 gp
- **Hands** 2

These manacles are nearly indistinguishable from real manacles upon inspection, but contain a hidden release that enables a wearer who knows the location of the release to free themselves with a single [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action. An observer who examines the manacles and succeeds at a DC 20 [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check notices their false nature. On a critical success, the observer finds the location of the hidden catch as well.
