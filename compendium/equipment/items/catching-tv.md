# Catching *Item 8*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Price** 425 gp
- **Usage** applied to shield
- **Category** Rune

A catching rune creates a small, magical vacuum that attempts to pull weapons away from opponents. If you can attempt to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) as part of a Shield Block, such as with the Disarming Block feat (Advanced Player's Guide 159) or this rune's activated ability, a catching shield grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to such [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) attempts.

- **Trigger**: You Shield Block a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) made with a held weapon

**Effect** You attempt to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) the creature whose attack you blocked of the weapon they attacked you with. You can do so even if you don't have a hand free.
