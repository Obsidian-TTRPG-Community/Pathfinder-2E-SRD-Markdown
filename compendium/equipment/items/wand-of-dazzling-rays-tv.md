# Wand of Dazzling Rays *Item 8+*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [good](rules/traits/good.md "Good Alignment Trait")  [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [wand](rules/traits/wand.md "Wand Item Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

Solidified radiance comprises this slender, featureless wand. It sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for the next 20 feet. After you Activate the wand, the light fades, so it only sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. The wand returns to its original brightness each dawn.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day, plus overcharge

**Effect** You cast [searing light](compendium/spells/searing-light.md) of the indicated level, dazzling your target with the beam's intensity. A creature that takes damage from the spell is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round and [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for a number of rounds equal to the spell level. On a critical success on the attack roll, the target is also [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for as long as it's [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) from the spell. However, it can attempt a Fortitude saving throw against your spell DC at the end of each of its turns, ending the [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) condition on a success (but remaining [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled)).
