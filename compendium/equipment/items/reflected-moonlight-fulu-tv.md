# Reflected Moonlight Fulu *Item 14*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [fulu](rules/traits/fulu-som.md "Fulu Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 750 gp
- **Bulk** —; **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You fail to save against a [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait") or [death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait") effect.

An acolyte accidentally left fulu paper outdoors overnight during a divine ceremony to [Tsukiyo](compendium/setting/deities/tsukiyo-logm.md) conducted only during a supermoon, creating the first reflected moonlight fulu. When you Activate this fulu, you reroll your saving throw against the triggering effect and take the better result. If this new roll is a critical success, the effect is reflected on its creator, who's treated as the effect's target, with any negative damage converted to positive. A reflected effect or spell affects only the original creator, even if it was an area spell or one that affects more than one creature.
