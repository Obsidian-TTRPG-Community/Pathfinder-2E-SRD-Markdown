The shaft of this bolt is wrapped with fine twine. When the bolt strikes a solid surface, the twine unwinds and enlarges into a 50-foot-long rope, securely fastened to the surface the bolt struck. The rope can be pulled free with an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action and a successful DC 20 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check.
