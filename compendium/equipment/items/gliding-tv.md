# Gliding *Item 8*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 450 gp
- **Usage** etched onto armor

The armor allows you to make a [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) descent.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") command


You glide slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down and up to 25 feet forward through the air. Provided you spend at least 1 action gliding on your turn and haven't yet reached the ground, you remain in the air at the end of your turn. Otherwise, you fall.
