Merciful weapons are sheathed in an unmistakable wispy green aura recognized by both gladiators and guards around the world. A merciful weapon has the [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md) trait and can't be used to make a lethal attack. Any [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) the weapon would deal is negated.

On a critical hit, a merciful weapon causes the target to become [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) with the weapon's wielder for 1 minute, as the target is bombarded with feelings of guilt and remorse. This is a [mental](rules/traits/mental.md) effect. If you have access to the weapon's critical specialization effect, you choose whether to use it or the merciful effect.
