Lady's blessing oil is favored by Pharasmin healers who ease the transitions of life. You can [Activate the item](rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) as part of the same activity you use to [Administer First Aid](rules/actions/administer-first-aid.md) to stabilize a creature. If you use lady's blessing oil, the DC of the check to [Administer First Aid](rules/actions/administer-first-aid.md) is reduced to the creature's recovery roll DC, rather than 5 + the recovery roll DC. However, if you roll a failure on the check, you get a critical failure instead.
