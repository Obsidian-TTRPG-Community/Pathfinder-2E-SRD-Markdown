The blade of this +2 greater striking greater frost greatsword appears to be nothing but icy shards. The frost brand automatically extinguishes non-magical fires in a 20-foot emanation. While wielding it, you gain fire resistance 5.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You swing the frost brand into the area of an ongoing magical fire, and the blade attempts to counteract the fire with a counteract modifier of +27. If it fails, it can't attempt to counteract the same fire again.
