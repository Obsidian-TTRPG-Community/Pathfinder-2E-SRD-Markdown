Constructed of green material and decorated with a white Glyph of the Open Road, a dozen or more small pockets line the inside of this pack. The pack is enchanted so that each pocket contains common, mundane gear, each item worth no more than 1 gp, such as chalk, flint and steel, and string. It doesn't contain any armor, shields, weapons, or items made of any kind of precious material. Keep track of the exact value of the gear you retrieve from the pack. The pack empties after 8 gp worth of items of your choice are removed, after which it becomes a mundane backpack.
