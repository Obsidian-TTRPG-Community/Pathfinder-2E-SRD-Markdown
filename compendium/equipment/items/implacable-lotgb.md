This substantial rune makes you difficult to hold back.

Whenever you are affected by an effect that lasts until you [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) (for instance, from the [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) action or a tanglefoot bag), you become [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened). You can use the extra action each round only to [Step](rules/actions/step.md) or [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md).
