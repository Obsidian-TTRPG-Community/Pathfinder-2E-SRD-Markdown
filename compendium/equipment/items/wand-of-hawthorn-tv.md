Carved from a hawthorn branch, this wand has a smooth handle, but the shaft remains covered in bark and long thorns. Polished red stones, arranged like a cluster of berries, decorate the pommel.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate

You cast [barkskin](compendium/spells/barkskin.md) of the indicated level, and the target sprouts long thorns like those of a hawthorn tree.

While barkskin lasts, any creature that hits the target with an unarmed [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or otherwise touches it takes piercing damage from the thorns, with the amount determined by the wand's type. A creature that has engulfed or swallowed the target takes this damage as well at the start of each of the target's turns.
