- **Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of barkskin of the appropriate level.
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

Carved from a hawthorn branch, this wand has a smooth handle, but the shaft remains covered in bark and long thorns. Polished red stones, arranged like a cluster of berries, decorate the pommel.

title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day, plus overcharge

**Effect** You cast [barkskin](compendium/spells/barkskin.md) of the indicated level, and the target sprouts long thorns like those of a hawthorn tree.

While barkskin lasts, any creature that hits the target with an unarmed [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or otherwise touches it takes piercing damage from the thorns, with the amount determined by the wand's type. A creature that has engulfed or swallowed the target takes this damage as well at the start of each of the target's turns.
