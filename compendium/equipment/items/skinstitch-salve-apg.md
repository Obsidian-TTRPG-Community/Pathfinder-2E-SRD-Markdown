This sticky salve stubbornly holds wounds closed and encourages swift natural healing. You can activate the salve in either of the following ways.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You [Administer First Aid](rules/actions/administer-first-aid.md) without requiring healer's tools. You either gain a +2 item bonus to the [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check, or you can use the skinstitch salve's [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) modifier of +13 instead of your own.
```

```ad-embed-ability

- **Trigger**: You [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md) or use Battle

**Effect** You gain a +2 item bonus to the triggering [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check. If you roll a success on the [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check, you get a critical success instead.
