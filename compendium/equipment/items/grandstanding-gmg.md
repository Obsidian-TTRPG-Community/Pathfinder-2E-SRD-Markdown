# Grandstanding *Item 11*

- **Usage** curses a weapon

Weapons with the _grandstanding_ curse inspire overconfidence in their wielders, demanding style over pragmatism. Whenever you reduce a foe to 0 Hit Points, you lose all remaining actions on your turn, as you are compelled to flourish, gloat, pose, or otherwise waste your time in response.
