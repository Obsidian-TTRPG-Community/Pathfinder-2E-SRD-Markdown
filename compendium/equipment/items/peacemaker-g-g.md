This ragged piece of white cloth is wrapped around the grip, stock, or haft of the affixed weapon.

When you activate the talisman, you gain the effects of a [sanctuary](compendium/spells/sanctuary.md) spell (DC 20) lasting for 1 minute. If you draw the affixed firearm, the effect ends immediately and the talisman crumbles.
