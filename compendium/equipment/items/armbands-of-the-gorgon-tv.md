# Armbands of the Gorgon *Item 17*  
[apex](rules/traits/apex.md "Apex Item Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 15000 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn armbands

Each of these shining, bluish-gray metal armbands is adorned with the plated visage of a gorgon's head. When targeted by a spell or effect with the [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait") effect, you treat the result of your save as if it were one degree of success better, and the result of any check made to inflict such an effect on you as one degree of success worse (as if you were more than twice the level of the spell or effect targeting you). When you invest the armbands, you either increase your Constitution score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.
