# Mattock of the Titans *Item 19*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 36000 gp
- **Craft Requirements** You are a titan, and the initial raw materials must include 8,100 gp of adamantine.
- **Bulk** 16; **Usage** held in 2 hands

This 15-foot-long adamantine digging tool is far too big for even a Large creature to wield, though if you're a Small or larger creature, you can wield it while wearing a belt of giant strength, as though it were appropriately sized for you and had 2 Bulk. The GM might also allow you to wield the mattock if you have some other means of wielding oversized weapons, such as if you're a Large barbarian with the giant instinct or are a Huge creature. When it's used as a weapon, the mattock of the titans has the statistics of a +3 greater striking keen adamantine great pick.

While you're wielding the mattock of the titans, you gain a +3 item bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks. You can use it to loosen or push soft earth at a rate of 1 minute per 5-foot cube or smash through solid stone at the rate of 5 minutes per 5-foot-cube.
