- **Ammunition** sling bullet
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

A big rock bullet is a sling bullet made of heavy granite, but each piece of ammunition feels much more dense than it appears. When activated, a big rock bullet transforms into a giant rock just before hitting the target. The target takes `4d6` additional bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. Even on a failed attack roll (but not a critical failure), the target takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage. Creatures with the [Catch Rock](rules/abilities/catch-rock.md) reaction can use it against a big rock bullet.
