- **Category** Consumable

Created by a chirurgeon who threw away morality in search of endless life, a thousand-pains fulu blocks the natural flow of elements in the body. A creature to which the fulu is affixed must attempt a basic Fortitude save against damage determined by the fulu's type.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Failure** or critical failure primes the target for [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) triggered by a specific condition that must be met within the fulu's duration.
