- **Bulk** —; **Usage** affixed to a creature

Created by a chirurgeon who threw away morality in search of endless life, a thousand-pains fulu blocks the natural flow of elements in the body. A creature to which the fulu is affixed must attempt a basic Fortitude save against damage determined by the fulu's type.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Failure** or critical failure primes the target for [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) triggered by a specific condition that must be met within the fulu's duration.

### Variants

#### burl thousand-pains fulu *Item 17*

- **Price**: 2700 gp

Though this green fulu looks inviting, it has a foreboding aura.

The DC is 35, and the fulu deals `10d8` poison damage, causing the target's body to respond adversely to their ki. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes fire damage, it takes `2d8` [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) as well. These effects have the [poison](rules/traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait") trait.

#### blade thousand-pains fulu *Item 8*

- **Price**: 90 gp

This red fulu feels rigid, its edges sharp, and looking at it makes you feel feverish. The DC is 23, and the fulu deals `5d6` slashing damage as meridians burst and cut through flesh. On a failure or critical failure, if the target fails to take an action with the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") or [move](rules/traits/move.md "Move Combat Trait") trait on each of its turns, it takes `1d6` [persistent slashing damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

#### icicle thousand-pains fulu *Item 14*

- **Price**: 630 gp

Looking at this black fulu leaves you queasy and cold. The DC is 30, and the fulu deals `10d6` cold damage as the target's ki warps and drains. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes damage from a [poison](rules/traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait") or [disease](rules/traits/disease.md "Disease Effect Trait") effect or becomes [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened), it takes `2d6` [persistent cold damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). These effects have the [cold](rules/traits/cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait") trait.

#### needle thousand-pains fulu *Item 11*

- **Price**: 270 gp

Picking up this white fulu feels like you've stabbed your hand with a pin. The DC is 27, and the fulu deals `7d6` piercing damage as hair, nails, and connective tissues stab inward. On a failure or critical failure, if the target then takes an action with the [move](rules/traits/move.md "Move Combat Trait") trait, it takes `2d6` [persistent piercing damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

#### stone thousand-pains fulu *Item 5*

- **Price**: 30 gp

This fulu's yellow parchment feels dusty and stiff. The DC is 19, and the fulu deals `3d6` bludgeoning damage as muscles swell to crush joints and bones. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes electricity damage, it takes `1d6` [persistent bludgeoning damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) as well.

#### void thousand-pains fulu *Item 20*

- **Price**: 8100 gp

The black dot at the center of this purple fulu draws in energy like a bottomless hole. The DC is 38, and the fulu deals `12d10` negative damage by dissipating the target's ki. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes any other damage within 1 minute, it takes `2d10` [persistent negative damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) as well. These effects have the [death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait") and [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait") traits. Each time the target takes this [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), any creature within 30 feet of it can use a reaction to gain temporary Hit Points equal to the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) taken, distributing the available temporary Hit Points among those that take the reaction. If the creature that affixed the fulu is within 30 feet, it instead gains all the available temporary Hit Points, if it wishes. These temporary Hit Points disappear after 1 minute.
