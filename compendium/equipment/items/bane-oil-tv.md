Bane oil comes in as many forms as the bane weapon property rune. Coating a weapon with the oil gives the weapon the benefit of one type of bane rune for 1 minute. A weapon can be coated in only one type of bane oil at a time. Any new application of this oil supersedes any previous one. If a weapon has the bane rune, this oil has no effect if it's of the same type as the rune.
