# Elven Chain *Item 13+*  
[uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Armor

Elven chain is a chain shirt made of [mithral](compendium/equipment/items/mithral.md) that glitters in even the faintest light. It has no check penalty.

Created by elven artisans employing ancient crafting techniques, elven chain is exceptionally quiet. Unlike other chain shirts—even other mithral chain shirts—elven chain does not have the [noisy](rules/traits/noisy.md) trait. This suit of armor can be etched with runes like any other mithral chain shirt.
