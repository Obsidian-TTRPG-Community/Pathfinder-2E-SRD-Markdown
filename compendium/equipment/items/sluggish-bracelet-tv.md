- **Bulk** —; **Usage** worn

A silver charm bracelet, a sluggish bracelet appears to be a bracelet of dashing, granting you a +1 item bonus to [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) checks. If the curse goes unrecognized, you think you can Activate it to gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed for 1 minute. Instead, its activation is as follows.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") command


You take a –10-foot penalty to your Speed for 1 minute, and the bracelet fuses to you.

Thereafter, it grants you no bonus to [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) checks, and it imposes a –5-foot status penalty to your Speed.
```
