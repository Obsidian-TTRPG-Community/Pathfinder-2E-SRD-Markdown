# Miogimo's Mask *Item 16*  
[invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [unique](rules/traits/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 9500 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn mask

The crime lord Miogimo almost always appears with this special mask, crafted with a piece of his soul. It has two forms.

In its first form, the mask depicts a silvery and angelic face; while wearing the mask in this form, your alignment appears as lawful good to creatures attempting to detect your alignment. In its second form, the mask depicts a gold-skinned demonic face; while wearing the mask in this form, your alignment appears as chaotic evil to creatures attempting to detect your alignment.

If you die while wearing the mask, a fragment of your soul is trapped in the mask, forming a life link. If there was already a soul fragment in the mask when this happens, you roll a Will save against the Will DC of the person who left the previous fragment. If you succeed, your soul fragment replaces the old one. On a failure, you die normally.
