Duration 1 week This blue fulu bears dark ink that slowly swirls and twists about itself, expanding and contracting on the paper over the course of the day in time with the tides. This fulu is most effective in the lowest area of a building, or near the most valuable or least-waterproof items. They're often seen as the rainy season approaches, with demand spiking just before a particularly large storm hits.

The fulu slows the spread of flooding water in a 30-foot radius by half, repelling the remaining water away. If the fulu becomes submersed, as the ink dissolves in the water, it releases a rush of heat in a 10-foot emanation, harmlessly vaporizing non-magical water in this area into steam and attempting to counteract any magical [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") effects with a +7 counteract modifier and a counteract level of 2; when this happens, the fulu's duration ends early.
