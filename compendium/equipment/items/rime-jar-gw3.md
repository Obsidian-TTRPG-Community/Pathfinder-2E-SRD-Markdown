Magical reagents slosh inside this rime-frosted pottery jar the size of a human head. Despite appearing to be rimed in hoarfrost, the jar is warm to the touch. Ilverani wizards create rime jars to sustain themselves during the coldest winter nights.

The jar draws off the cold and warms your body. If you have the [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) condition caused by exposure to environmental cold, it removes the condition. For 8 hours after applying the rime, you treat extreme cold as severe cold.
