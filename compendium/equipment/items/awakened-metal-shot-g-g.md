### Variants

#### awakened adamantine shot *Item 18*

- **Price**: 3500 gp

The shot is a high-grade adamantine bullet. The awakened adamantine breaks through any resistance. The shot ignores the first 20 resistance a creature has to physical damage, all damage, or piercing or bludgeoning damage. Against a golem or creature who already has a resistance bypassed by adamantine, or a weakness to adamantine, the shot shatters the target's defenses, causing them to become [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) for 1 minute instead. Because adamantine is uncommon, this version of awakened metal shot is uncommon even for gunslingers or other characters with access to uncommon guns and bullets from this book.

#### awakened cold iron shot *Item 17*

- **Price**: 2300 gp

The shot is a high-grade cold iron bullet. The awakened cold iron attempts to disrupt enchantments the target placed on others' minds. You can name a creature you believe to be enchanted by your target or allow the shot to choose an enchanted creature randomly. On a hit, the shot attempts to counteract the enchantment the target is using to manipulate that creature's mind. The counteract level is 9, and the counteract modifier is +27. If you fail (but don't critically fail) the counteract check against a demon or fey, you get a success instead. If you hit a demon or fey with no active [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait") effects on other creatures, the target is [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 minute instead.

#### awakened silver shot *Item 17*

- **Price**: 2300 gp

The shot is a high-grade silver bullet. The awakened silver gleams with altered celestial moonlight designed to weaken and expose devils and werecreatures. On a hit, it attempts to counteract any [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait") effect on the target. The counteract level is 9, and the counteract modifier is +27. If you fail (but don't critically fail) the counteract check against a devil or a werecreature, you get a success instead. If you counteracted the Change Shape ability, the creature can't use that ability again for 1 round, or 1 minute on a critical success. If you hit a devil or werecreature not under a [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait") effect, the target is [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 minute instead.
