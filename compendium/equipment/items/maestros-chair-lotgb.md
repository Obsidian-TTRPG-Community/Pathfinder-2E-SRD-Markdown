A maestro's chair is a traveler's chair with the impulse control upgrade (see below) and a small pipe organ installed into the frame. You can use the maestro's chair to make [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks in the same manner that you could use any mundane instrument, using both of your hands. When you make a [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check using your chair, you gain a +1 item bonus to the check.
