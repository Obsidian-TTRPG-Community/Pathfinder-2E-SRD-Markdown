# Silversheen *Item 2*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  

- **Price** 6 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 2 hands
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

You can slather this silvery paste onto one melee weapon, one thrown weapon, or 10 pieces of ammunition. Silversheen spoils quickly, so once you open a vial, you must use it all at once, rather than saving it. For the next hour, the weapon or ammunition counts as silver instead of its normal precious material (such as cold iron) for any physical damage it deals.
