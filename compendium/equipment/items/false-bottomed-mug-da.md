This mug looks like any other; however, the bottom part unscrews to reveal a velvetlined chamber. These are primarily used by members of the Bellflower Network to sneak messages and small objects to other possible members. The [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC to discover the false bottom is 15 if someone specifically examines the mug.
