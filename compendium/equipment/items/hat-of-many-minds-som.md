# Hat Of Many Minds *Item 12*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")

**Effect** You tear off a patch of cloth to manifest it into a copy of yourself, dressed in the color and fabric of the patch.

It doesn't react quickly enough to be of any use during an encounter, and it can't use your spells or other special abilitiesâ€”just basic actions and skill actions.

The copy disappears and returns to the hat as a piece of cloth when the given task has been completed, or when you [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the activation.
