# Disrupting *Item 5+*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Usage** etched onto a melee weapon

A disrupting weapon pulses with positive energy, dealing an extra `1d6` positive damage to undead. On a critical hit, the undead is also [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) until the end of your next turn.

Increase the extra damage to `2d6`. On a critical hit, instead of being [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled), the undead creature must attempt a DC 34 Fortitude save with the following effects. This is an [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait") effect.
