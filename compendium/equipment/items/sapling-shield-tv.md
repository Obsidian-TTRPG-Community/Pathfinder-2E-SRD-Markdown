# Sapling Shield *Item 3+*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This surprisingly weighty, though well-balanced, wooden buckler is emblazoned with the image of a sapling. The sapling withers as the shield takes damage.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") envision


The buckler expands, with the sapling image growing into a mighty oak tree. The buckler becomes a tower shield, gaining the corresponding AC bonus, Speed penalty, and ability to [Take Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md). It keeps the same Hit Points and [Broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) Threshold, but its Hardness and Bulk increase by 2 in this form. The shield remains in this form until you Activate it again to revert it to a buckler.
