The appearance of this beautifully crafted +2 disrupting greater striking lance changes to match the armor of its wielder. It has a cloth flag attached behind the lance point that displays whatever heraldry the wielder wishes.

If a cavalier with the Cavalier's Banner feat takes the knight captain's lance, it instead automatically displays the banner of their pledge.
