# Puzzle Box *Item 0+*  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

A puzzle box features moving parts, locking mechanisms, and other components designed to confound the user. Solving a puzzle box typically requires three successful [Games Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) or [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) checks to Open a Lock, though puzzle boxes come in countless configurations and themes, and the GM can determine which skills are appropriate.
