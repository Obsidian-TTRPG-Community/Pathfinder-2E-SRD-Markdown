- **Usage** worn necklace
- **Category** Artifact

This brilliant jewelry is made from fine silver interwoven with a uniquely malleable form of ruby that causes the necklace to glimmer like a flickering fire. Hao Jin created the necklaces to mitigate the potential of death during the Ruby Phoenix Tournament pre-qualifier, and she specially attuned each phoenix necklace to the silver feathers she created for the pre-qualifying round. While the silver feathers themselves aren't magical, they are required to activate the necklace's power. Each team starts with 3 feathers [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) in their headquarters; they acquire more through challenges and events.

Additionally, the tournament emissary's enforcers have the ability to deliver messages to the necklace's wearer at any time by casting sending, though the wearer can't respond.

title: Activate [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")

You select any number of willing creatures you can see within 30 feet, including yourself. The selected creatures can make nonlethal attacks without taking a penalty to their attack rolls. This effect remains in place until you remove the necklace or use this activation again.

The necklace consumes one of the attached silver feathers and casts 7th-level [raise dead](compendium/spells/raise-dead.md). Activating this ability is particularly costly and every activation requires consuming one more silver feather than the previous activation.
