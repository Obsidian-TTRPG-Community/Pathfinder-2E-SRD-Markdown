# Gauntlet Buckler *Item 0*  
[foldaway](rules/traits/foldaway-tv.md)  

- **Price** 5 gp
- **Bulk** 1
- **AC Bonus** +1/+1; **null Hardness** 3, **null HP** 6 (BT 3)
- **Category** Shield; **Group** Shield 

This buckler-sized shield is segmented, allowing it to collapse into a housing bound to a gauntlet for easy storage. A small catch enables you to expand the shield quickly in battle when you're in need of defense.
