This ornately designed metal staff shines with precious inlays of gold. When you [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from the staff, the illusory image of something you desire flashes across its surface.

While wielding the staff, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to identify illusion magic.

You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
