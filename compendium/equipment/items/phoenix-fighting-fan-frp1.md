This elegant silver fighting fan features sharp silver feathers instead of traditional paper leaves in its design.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") command, envision, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You call upon the fan's extradimensional powers to trap a creature in Hao Jin's repository, a small demiplane that holds the countless relics Hao Jin collected over her lifetime (though a trapped creature cannot interact with any of these relics). The fighting fan casts maze on a creature within 30 feet. The fan automatically Sustains the Spell as long as you [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) a creature with it each round.

The [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) or [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC to escape the demiplane is 34. The spell ends once the creature escapes, you fail to [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) a creature with the fan during a round, or after 1 minute, whichever comes first.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [‚è≤](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency") 10 minute envision, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


The fan casts 8th-level [raise dead](compendium/spells/raise-dead.md), consuming the phoenix fighting fan in the process.
