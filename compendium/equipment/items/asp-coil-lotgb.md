The asp coil, named both for its slithering striking style and its usage among Aspis Consortium agents, has two forms. In sword form, it resembles an elegant, oddly balanced sword. However, with a twist of the pommel, the blade splits into a series of segments connected by elaborate metal cables. Agents of the Aspis Consortium have access to this weapon.
