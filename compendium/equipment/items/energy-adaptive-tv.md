[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 2600 gp
- **Usage** etched onto armor

A complex pattern of protective symbols gives protection against various forms of energy, but only part of the runic structure can be active at a given time.

```ad-embed-ability

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger**: You take acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage

**Effect** You gain resistance 5 to the triggering damage type. This doesn't apply to the triggering damage. This resistance lasts until you Activate this rune again or the armor is no longer invested by you.
