# Iron Equalizer *Item 12*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 400 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to a weapon
- **Activate** [Certain Strike](compendium/feats/certain-strike.md); **Requirements** You are a master with the affixed weapon.

This small iron band has a shifting weight that helps equalize the affixed weapon's balance. When you activate it, you use [Certain Strike](compendium/feats/certain-strike.md), as the fighter feat. You must meet the normal requirements, including those of the [press](rules/traits/press.md "Press Combat Trait") trait.

If you have the [Certain Strike](compendium/feats/certain-strike.md) feat, the failure effect increases to deal the weapon's normal damage.
