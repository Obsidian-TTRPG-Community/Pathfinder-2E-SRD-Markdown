# Dragon Turtle Plate *Item 9*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 700 gp
- **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the shell of a dragon turtle (Bestiary 128).
- **Bulk** 3; **Usage** worn armor

This harness of +1 resilient half plate is made from the shell plates of a dragon turtle and has the [aquadynamic](rules/traits/aquadynamic-tv.md "Aquadynamic Armor Trait") trait (page 8). Fashioned from organic material, the suit is one of the few heavy armors not anathema to druids.
