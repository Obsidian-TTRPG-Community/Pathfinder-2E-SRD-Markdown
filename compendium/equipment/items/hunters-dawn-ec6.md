# Hunter's Dawn *Item 23*  
[arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait")  [artifact](rules/traits/artifact-gmg.md "Artifact Item Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [unique](rules/traits/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

Hunter's Dawn is a club. However, the notched head of the weapon marks it as an atlatl, an ancient tool used for throwing [darts](compendium/equipment/items/dart.md) and [javelins](compendium/equipment/items/javelin.md). You can use Hunter's Dawn with a mundane dart or javelin like you would use a bow with an arrow; when you do so, the range of the dart or javelin is doubled, and the dart or javelin uses Hunter's Dawn to determine its attack modifier and damage dice.

title: **Activate** [V](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Varies") Varies ([>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action"), [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action"), or [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")) [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You swing Hunter's Dawn and launch a magically conjured javelin at a target within 60 feet, making a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). The javelin has the statistics of a javelin but gains the magical properties of Hunter's Dawn and disappears immediately after hitting or missing its target. On a successful hit, you deal damage (`3d6` piercing, due to the atlatl's greater striking rune, plus your Strength modifier); in addition, a gazelle leaps from the hit target to one or more targets within 20 feet of the first, dealing `2d6` piercing damage plus your Strength modifier.

The number of additional targets hit in this way is equal to the number of actions you spend to activate this ability (one additional target if you used one action, two additional targets for two actions, and so forth).

title: **Activate** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: You hit a creature with a ranged Strike with Hunter's Dawn

**Effect** The target is marked. Once per day, you can cast a 5th-level [locate](compendium/spells/locate.md) spell on the marked target, regardless of its distance from you or your ability to cast spells. This effect persists until it is dispelled (counterspell DC 46), the creature dies, or a new target is marked.
```

title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: three per day

**Effect** You shave a curl of wood from Hunter's Dawn and create a roaring fire within 15 feet. You can choose one of the following shapes for the fire to take: a 10-foot square, a 20-foot line, or a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the affected squares take `6d6` fire damage (DC 46 basic Reflex save)
