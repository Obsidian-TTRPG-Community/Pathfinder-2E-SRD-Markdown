[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [snare](rules/traits/snare.md "Snare Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")

You pile waterlogged plants or access a nearby source of water to rain down on a Medium or smaller creature that enters the snare's square. When a creature enters the square, the snare's square and all adjacent squares become slippery difficult terrain, and the triggering creature must attempt a DC 19 Reflex saving throw, with the following effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The target falls [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
> - **Critical Failure** The target falls [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) and is forced into one of the other squares soaked by the snare.
