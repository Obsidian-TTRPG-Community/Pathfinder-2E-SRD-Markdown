This knot of copper wire reshapes itself in a new pattern every time its affixed weapon deals damage. When you activate the coil, the damaged creature must succeed at a DC 31 Will save or be [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned). If it critically fails, it instead becomes [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
