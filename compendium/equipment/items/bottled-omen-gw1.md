This potion holds a tiny, tightly wrapped scroll and tastes like paper. Upon drinking it, you gain a burst of insight into your immediate futureâ€”and how to potentially avoid it. When you attempt a saving throw, you can roll twice and use the better result. The potion's magic ends when you make use of this effect, or after 1 minute. You then become immune to bottled omen potions for 24 hours.
