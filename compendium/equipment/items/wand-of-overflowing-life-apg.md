# Wand Of Overflowing Life *Item 9+*  
[healing](rules/traits/healing.md "Healing Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [positive](rules/traits/positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait")  [wand](rules/traits/wand.md "Wand Item Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This alabaster wand has a clear crystal at the tip.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day, plus overcharge

**Effect** You cast [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) at the indicated level. After you cast the spell, at the start of your next turn, excess healing magic wells up from the wand and heals you, as though you cast the 1-action version of heal on yourself at the same spell level.

You gain this benefit only once, even if you cast multiple [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) spells from wands of overflowing life in the same turn.
```
