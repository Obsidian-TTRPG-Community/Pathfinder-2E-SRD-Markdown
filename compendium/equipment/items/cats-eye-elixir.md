After you consume this elixir, your vision sharpens and you become sensitive to even the most minute movements. For the next minute, you reduce the flat check to target [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) creatures to 5, and you don't need to attempt a flat check to target [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) creatures. These benefits apply only against creatures within 30 feet of you.
