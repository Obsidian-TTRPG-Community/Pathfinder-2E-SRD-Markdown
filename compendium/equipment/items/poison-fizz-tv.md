- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

Made from a special mixture of honey and alchemical reagents, poison fizz is a zesty, sweet rock candy that pops and crackles in your mouth. For 1 hour, you have resistance to poison and an item bonus to saving throws against poison and being [petrified](rules/conditions.md#Petrified).

You bite the poison fizz to release its poisonous liquid center and spray green mist in a 15-foot cone. This deals poison damage with a basic Reflex save. A creature that critically fails is also [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) until the end of your next turn and is then temporarily immune to being [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by poison fizz for 1 hour.
