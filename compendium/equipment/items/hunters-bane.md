This talisman is a ring of dried, interwoven leaves. When you activate the hunter's bane, you sense the exact location of the attacker, making it [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from you instead of [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected). If the attacker is behind lead, the hunter's bane fails and is wasted.
