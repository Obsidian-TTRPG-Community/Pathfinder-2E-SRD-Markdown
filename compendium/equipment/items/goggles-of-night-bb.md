The opaque crystal lenses of these sleek goggles don't obscure vision, but rather enhance it. While wearing the goggles, you gain a +1 item bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks involving sight. Once per day, you can use the following action.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Go Dark [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

You carefully rotate the lenses 90 degrees, and you gain [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md). For 1 hour, you can see just as well in darkness as you can in the light.
