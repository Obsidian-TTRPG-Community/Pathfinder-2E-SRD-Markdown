title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Requirements**: Your last action was a successful [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with this weapon, or you have a creature [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) with this weapon

**Effect** The target is [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) until the end of your next turn. A [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) creature can use the [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) action to get out of the Grab, and the Grab ends for a [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) creature if you move away from it. This functions as the Grab creature ability.
```

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Requirements**: You have a creature [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) with this weapon

**Effect** The crab claw animates and pinches open and shut, dealing slashing damage equal to the scizore of the crab's number of damage dice.
