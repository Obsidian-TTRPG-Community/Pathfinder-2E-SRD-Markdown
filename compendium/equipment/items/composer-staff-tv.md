# Composer Staff *Item 4+*  
[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [staff](rules/traits/staff.md "Staff Item Trait")  

- **Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

A composer staff is short and shaped like an elegant black conductor's baton with a silver tip. When waved through the air, it hums melodically. In this way, you can play it as though it were an instrument, and it grants a +1 item bonus to [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks made with it.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)


You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
```
