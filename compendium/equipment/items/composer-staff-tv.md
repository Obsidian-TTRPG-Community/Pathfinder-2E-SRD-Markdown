# Composer Staff *Item 4+*

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Staff

A composer staff is short and shaped like an elegant black conductor's baton with a silver tip. When waved through the air, it hums melodically. In this way, you can play it as though it were an instrument, and it grants a +1 item bonus to [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks made with it.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate

You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
