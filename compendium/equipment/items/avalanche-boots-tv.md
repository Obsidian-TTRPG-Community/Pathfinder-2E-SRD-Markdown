# Avalanche Boots *Item 17*  
[apex](rules/traits/apex.md)  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Price** 15000 gp
- **Usage** worn boots; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Apex

While the insides of these boots are comfortable, fur-lined leather, the outsides are a jumble of slate plates, giving the impression of a rockslide. You gain a +3 item bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks and a +2 circumstance bonus to [Force Open](rules/actions/force-open.md) and [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md).

When you invest the boots, you either increase your Strength score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.

title: Activate [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action")

- **Trigger**: You succeed or critically succeed with a [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md)

**Effect** If the [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) was a success, you push your opponent up to 10 feet instead of 5 feet. If the [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) was a critical success, you push your opponent up to 20 feet, and you can then choose to knock them [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
