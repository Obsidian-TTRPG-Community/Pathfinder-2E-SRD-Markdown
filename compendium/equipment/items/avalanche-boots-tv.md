# Avalanche Boots *Item 17*  
[apex](rules/traits/apex.md "Apex Item Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 15000 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** worn boots

While the insides of these boots are comfortable, fur-lined leather, the outsides are a jumble of slate plates, giving the impression of a rockslide. You gain a +3 item bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks and a +2 circumstance bonus to [Force Open](rules/actions/force-open.md) and [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md).

When you invest the boots, you either increase your Strength score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") envision

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger**: You succeed or critically succeed with a [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md)

**Effect** If the [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) was a success, you push your opponent up to 10 feet instead of 5 feet. If the [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) was a critical success, you push your opponent up to 20 feet, and you can then choose to knock them [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
