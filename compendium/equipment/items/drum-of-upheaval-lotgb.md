# Drum Of Upheaval *Item 20*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 60000 gp
- **Craft Requirements** You are a centaur.
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 2 hands

This heavy drum is engraved along the sides with images of centaurs in fierce combat. The drum grants you a +3 item bonus on [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks you make using the drum.

Additionally, it imparts the rhythms of two songs upon your mind as soon as you touch it. One is a fast marching cadence; the other is a frenetic ritual dance. Each song has a different activation.
