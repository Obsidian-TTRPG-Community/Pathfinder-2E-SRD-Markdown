This heavy drum is engraved along the sides with images of centaurs in fierce combat. The drum grants you a +3 item bonus on [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks you make using the drum.

Additionally, it imparts the rhythms of two songs upon your mind as soon as you touch it. One is a fast marching cadence; the other is a frenetic ritual dance. Each song has a different activation.

Dozens of spectral centaurs burst from the drum and stampede in a 60-foot cone. The stampede deals `7d10` force damage (DC 43 basic Reflex save).
