A hunter's arrowhead is meant to be worn as a charm, such as a pendant, or carried in a pocket or quiver. The arrowhead is etched with images sacred to the elven god [Ketephys](compendium/setting/deities/ketephys-logm.md). While you wear or carry the arrowhead, it infuses you with great skill at hunting, and you gain a +1 item bonus to [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) checks and attack rolls against any creature you've currently designated as your prey with [Hunt Prey](rules/actions/hunt-prey.md). A hunter's arrowhead is also a religious symbol of [Ketephys](compendium/setting/deities/ketephys-logm.md).
