# Traveler's Chair *Item 1*  

- **Price** 5 gp
- **Bulk** 3
- **Category** Wheelchair

This wheelchair is tailored for adventures and travels. The design is sleek and fashionable to provide excellent comfort and support. A traveler's chair has small mechanisms, either made from interlocking wood pieces, clockwork, or other devices, that allow the chair to traverse up or down stairs without any additional difficulty (moving up stairs is still difficult terrain, just like for other characters), and move through other such environments that adventurers and travelers encounter without any additional difficulty, such as ladders and uneven ground.

Magical Wheelchairs The following wheelchairs use technology and magic for incredible effects, in addition to the basic benefits granted from the base wheelchair (typically a traveler's chair).
