# Forge Warden *Item 10*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 975 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Group** Shield 

The religious symbol of Torag, the forge god—an ornate hammer of dwarven construction—adorns the face of this reinforced steel shield (Hardness 10, HP 24, BT 12). The shield is a religious symbol of Torag.

You and any adjacent allies have fire resistance 5 while you have the shield raised. When used for a [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md), the forge warden rings out like the hammer strike of a blacksmith, and the symbol glows as if lit by the fires of a furnace.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") command ([fire](rules/traits/fire.md))

- **Trigger**: You use the forge warden to [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) an adjacent creature's attack and the shield takes damage

**Effect** The attacking creature takes `2d6` fire damage.
