# Tanglefoot Extruder *Item 3*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 50 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

This portable nozzle-and-trigger assembly based on spider spinnerets can extrude and weave alchemical adhesives into temporary constructions. As an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action, you can attach a tanglefoot bag to the extruder. A loaded tanglefoot extruder can be activated to consume the attached tanglefoot bag and convert it into a 30-foot rope, whip, or net, depending on the nozzle die you choose when activating the device. The created object lasts for 1 hour. The DC to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) a created rope (if used to bind a creature) or net is equal to the consumed tanglefoot bag's DC and Escaping destroys the created object.
