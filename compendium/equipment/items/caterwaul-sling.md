# Caterwaul Sling *Item 5*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 155 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

Made of shiny brown leather, this +1 striking sling has a single white thread interwoven into its cord.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) ([sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md))

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You pull the white thread free, then whirl the sling in circles at high speed. It lets out an ear-piercing wave of sound.

Each creature in a 30-foot cone takes `4d6` sonic damage (DC 21 basic Fortitude save). Any creature that fails is [deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 round, or 1 hour on a critical failure.
