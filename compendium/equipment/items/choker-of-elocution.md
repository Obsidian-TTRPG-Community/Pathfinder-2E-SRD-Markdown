This platinum choker bears characters from a language's alphabet, and it gives knowledge of that language and the associated culture's customs. You gain a +1 item bonus to [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) checks and the ability to understand, speak, and write the chosen language.

Your excellent elocution reduces the DC of the flat check to perform an auditory action while [deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened) from 5 to 3.
