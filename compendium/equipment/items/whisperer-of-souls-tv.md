# Whisperer of Souls *Item 28*  
[artifact](rules/traits/artifact-gmg.md "Artifact Item Trait")  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [unique](rules/traits/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** held in 2 hands

This +4 major striking greater brilliant [keen](compendium/equipment/items/keen.md) [glaive](compendium/equipment/items/glaive.md) binds the souls of powerful creatures it slays. The soul can't be returned to life by any means while imprisoned within the glaive and can be freed only by a deed of great benevolence or selflessness. While using the glaive as a weapon, whenever you reduce a sapient creature of 18th level or higher to 0 Hit Points or roll a critical success with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against such a target, the creature must attempt a DC 50 Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** No additional effect.
> - **Success** The glaive siphons the creature's essence, rendering it [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained). If the creature dies from the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or while [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) in this way, the creature's soul is bound in the glaive.
> - **Failure** As success, but the creature is [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained).
> - **Critical Failure** As success, but the creature is [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained).
>
>    The glaive also has the following activations.

title: **Activate** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") envision

- **Trigger**: You [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the Whisperer of Souls

**Effect** You choose whether the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) deals lethal or nonlethal damage. If the glaive has a reason for doing so, such as slaying a creature whose soul the glaive can absorb, it can defy your choice if you fail a DC 50 Will save.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") envision

- **Trigger**: You attempt an [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) check to [Decipher Writing](rules/actions/decipher-writing.md), [Identify Magic](rules/actions/identify-magic.md), [Learn a Spell](rules/actions/learn-a-spell.md), or [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md)

**Effect** You listen to eldritch secrets the weapon whispers, gaining a +4 item bonus to the triggering check.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") command, envision, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per week

**Effect** Attempt an [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) check as if you cast the legend lore ritual about a subject. If you roll a success or critical success, you can repeat what the Whisperer of Souls relates to you about the subject. On a critical failure, you and the glaive are drawn into a murmuring void of cold, where your mind is assaulted by strange visions for an entire week. At the end of this time, you reappear and must attempt a DC 50 Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** When you return, you can retrain one of your skills into a [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill about evil creatures or places, as if you had spent 1 week retraining.
> - **Failure** As success, but you are [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 week.
> - **Critical Failure** As success, but your alignment moves one step toward evil and you must retrain one of your skills into a [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) about evil creatures or places. You become obsessed with increasing your forbidden knowledge, turning to wicked forces that offer such secrets and compromising your morals further if you must.
>
>    Destruction If the Whisperer of Souls is used to slay [Shelyn](compendium/setting/deities/shelyn.md)'s herald, it disintegrates, bringing about great evil in its wake.
