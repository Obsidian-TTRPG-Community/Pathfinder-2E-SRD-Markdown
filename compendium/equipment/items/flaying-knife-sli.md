This long, thin +1 striking wounding dagger has a smooth edge on one side and a serrated edge on the other. Its [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) comes from slicing away long strips of the target's flesh, and it deals `1d8` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) on a hit instead of `1d6`. A creature takes a â€“2 status penalty to saving throws against diseases for as long as it has [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from this knife.
