# Blindpepper Bolt *Item 3*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 10 gp
- **Ammunition** [bolt](compendium/equipment/items/bolt.md)
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

The head of this bolt is a vented container that smells strongly of caustic pepper. When an activated blindpepper bolt hits a target, it deals no damage; instead the creature must attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save. If the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) was a critical success, the target takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to its Fortitude save. At the GM's discretion, a creature with no eyes or olfactory organs might not be affected by this item.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until the end of your next turn. It can end the effect early if it spends an action, which has the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") trait, to wipe down its eyes.
> - **Failure** The target is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) until the end of your next turn and [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute.
