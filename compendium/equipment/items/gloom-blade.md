As black as coal, this blade grows more potent in darkness. While in bright light, it functions as a +1 shortsword and doesn't appear to radiate a magic aura to detect magic or similar spells unless the spells are 4th level or higher.

In dim light or darkness, the gloom blade becomes a +2 striking shortsword. Whenever you use the gloom blade to attack a creature you're [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by, you deal `1d6` additional precision damage.

To upgrade the gloom blade's fundamental runes, start with the base +1 shortsword, but if you improve it beyond a +2 striking shortsword, the runes apply in dim light or darkness as well.
