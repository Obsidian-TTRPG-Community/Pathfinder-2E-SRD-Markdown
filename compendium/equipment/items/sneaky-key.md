# Sneaky Key *Item 5*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 22 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md); **Requirements** You are an expert in [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery).

This small silver skeleton key can be pinned to armor or a sleeve. When you turn the key to activate it, for the next minute, if the outcome of any your attempts to [Pick a Lock](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md) is a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
