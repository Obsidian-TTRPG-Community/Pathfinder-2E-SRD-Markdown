This sharp-taloned spiked gauntlet appears to have been crafted from dragon scales, with claws built from iron. In addition to the typical weapon traits, a _Cinderclaw gauntlet_ has the [versatile <s>](rules/traits/versatile-s.md "Versatile Weapon Trait") trait.

On a critical hit, the _Cinderclaw gauntlet_ deals an additional `1d6` fire damage.
