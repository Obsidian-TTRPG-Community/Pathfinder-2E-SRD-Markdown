# Gourd Home *Item 9*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [extradimensional](rules/traits/extradimensional.md "Extradimensional Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [structure](rules/traits/structure.md "Structure General Trait")  

- **Price** 650 gp
- **Bulk** L (when not activated)

This dried gourd seems entirely nondescript, as it is hollow and has a sturdy cord wrapped around its neck for easy carrying. Closer inspection reveals the gourd has grown in the rough shape of a hut or similar small dwelling.

You place the _gourd home_ on the ground (in an open area large enough to contain it) and cause it to expand in size to a 30-foot-square structure with one door. The interior of the gourd is a single large room that can hold 10 Small or Medium creatures with moderate comfort.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Requirements**: The _gourd home_ must be expanded into its house form atop earth or soil.

**Effect** By rapping on the door from either outside or inside, you cause the _gourd home_ to shrink back into its normal size and appear to be a non-magical gourd sitting on the ground. For the following 8 hours, the interior of the _gourd home_ becomes an extradimensional space whose size appears unchanged to those within.

If anyone outside picks up or damages the gourd, or if anyone inside the _gourd home_ attempts to exit, all creatures within the _gourd home_ immediately reappear in the area surrounding the gourd, and the _gourd home_ becomes inactive for 24 hours.
