This exquisite fiddle is perfectly carved and balanced to produce the purest sound while granting its player perfect balance and poise. It grants a +2 item bonus to [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks. If you're a master in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance), while playing it you also gain a +1 status bonus to Reflex saves and a +1 item bonus to Dexterity-based skill checks. If you're legendary in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance), the bonuses are +2.

When you [Perform](rules/actions/perform.md) with the fiddle, you can choose to create a harsh and discordant note. You critically fail the [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check, shred the strings of the fiddle, and create an 8th-level [sound burst](compendium/spells/sound-burst.md), with a 40-foot emanation around you instead of a 10-foot burst. The fiddle can't be played again until the strings are replaced at a cost of 200 gp.
