# Headband of Inspired Wisdom *Item 17*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [apex](rules/traits/apex.md "Apex Item Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 15000 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** worn circlet

This simple cloth headband remains pristine and clean at all times, no matter the circumstances. When you invest the headband, you either increase your Wisdom score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.

title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") envision

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** When you are considering a course of action, you get a gut feeling about whether it's a good idea. You gain the effects of an [augury](compendium/spells/augury.md) spell, except that you receive the result from your own instincts rather than an external source.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") envision ([fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md))

- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger**: You fail a saving throw against an effect that makes you [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused), [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), or [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied)

**Effect** The headband of inspired wisdom clears your mind. You can reroll the saving throw and use the better result.
