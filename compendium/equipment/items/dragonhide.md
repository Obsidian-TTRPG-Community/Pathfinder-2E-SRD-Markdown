# Dragonhide *Item 8+*  
[precious](rules/traits/precious.md "Precious Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Category** Material

The hide and scales of a dragon can be used to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) any item normally made of ordinary leather or hide. Dragonhide varies in color from blue to glittering gold, depending on the dragon it came from. Due to the scales' resiliency, it can also be used to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) armor usually made out of metal plates (such as a breastplate, half plate, and full plate), allowing such armor to be made without metal. Dragonhide objects are immune to one damage type, depending on the type of dragon (see the table below).

| Dragon Type | Resistance |
|-------------|------------|
| Black or copper | Acid |
| Blue or bronze | Electricity |
| Brass, gold, or red | Fire |
| Green | Poison |
| Silver or white | Cold |
