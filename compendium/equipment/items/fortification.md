# Fortification *Item 12+*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Usage** etched onto medium or heavy armor

A fortification rune wards against the most deadly attacks.

Each time you're critically hit while wearing the etched armor, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. This property thickens the armor, increasing its Bulk by 1 and the Strength required to reduce its penalties by 2.
