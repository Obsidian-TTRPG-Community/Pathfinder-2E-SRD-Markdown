Each of these unassuming sacks contains enough rotting fruit to provide a fungus leshy with 1 week's worth of rations, along with clusters of stones to help press out the fruit's juices. When you [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) a creature with a sack of rotten fruit, the sack is consumed while the creature takes `1d4` bludgeoning damage and must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened). The range increment of a thrown sack of rotten fruit is 20 feet.
