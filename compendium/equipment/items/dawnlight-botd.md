[divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Craft Requirements** You have a spellcasting class feature with the divine tradition.
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This shining symbol of [Sarenrae](compendium/setting/deities/sarenrae.md) depicts the goddess with her arms held wide. In the center of the symbol is a crystal reliquary with a perfect feather floating inside, glowing bright as a candle with the light of the goddess.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** The dawnlight casts 1st-level [disrupt undead](compendium/spells/disrupt-undead.md) or light. The dawnlight's spell attack roll and counteract modifier are +7, and any spell with the [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait") trait is treated as though its counteract level were 1 higher for counteracting darkness.

### Variants

#### dawnlight *Item 3*

- **Price**: 60 gp

#### greater *Item 7*

- **Price**: 320 gp

Whenever you successfully counteract magical darkness while holding this symbol, the clash of magic unleashes a momentary flash of light. Creatures with darkvision in the area of the [light](compendium/spells/light.md) spell or targeted by it must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round. Those with light blindness are also exposed to bright light.

Change the list of spells to 3rd-level versions of disrupt undead, light, and searing light. The spell attack roll and counteract modifier are +13.

#### major *Item 11*

- **Price**: 1300 gp

A major dawnlight creates a flash of light like a greater dawnlight, but the DC is 28. Change the list of spells to 5th-level versions of disrupt undead and light, and 4th-level versions of searing light and vital beacon. The spell attack roll and counteract modifier are +18.
