This lockpick houses a small compartment containing many smaller picks and other miniature tools. The lockpick itself is surprisingly malleable, belying the components within. An almost-impossible number of other tools are [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) in the compartment, including an entire set of infiltrator thieves' tools and any replacement picks, an elite disguise kit and any replacement cosmetics, and an extreme climber's kit, all while still somehow remaining only light Bulk. This makes the encompassing lockpick a favorite discreet option for rogues infiltrating high society events, as formal wear generally has few pockets and only allows a character to wear a single tool kit of light Bulk.
