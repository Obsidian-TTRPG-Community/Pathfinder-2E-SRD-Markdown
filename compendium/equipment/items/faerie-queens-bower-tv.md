A suit of autumn's embrace armor (page 14) can gain sapience when lovingly crafted by a fae monarch of sufficient power; a suit of faerie queen's bower is one such example. The armor is happy to give you and your companions counsel, hoping to guide you on a path of benevolence and aid you in battles against forces that seek to cause harm to the natural world. It refuses access to its magic to anyone who causes undue harm to plants or animals. In addition to the features and activation of autumn's embrace, faerie queen's bower has the following activation.

The armor casts 4th-level [safe passage](compendium/spells/safe-passage-apg.md) (Advanced Player's Guide 224), with the protected area beginning from your square and extending to a place of relative safety.
