A small glass orb on the head of a gambler's staff holds a pair of six-sided dice that shift and roll within. Spellcasters who make their living via games of chance use gamblers' staves to encourage the odds in their favor. Most gambling dens ban players they discover using such magic items. A gambler's staff grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to [Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md) from gambling (typically using [Games Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore)). To get this benefit, the staff must be on your person during all the downtime you spend gambling.
