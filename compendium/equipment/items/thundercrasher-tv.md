While looking straight down the barrel of this +1 striking blunderbussG&G, the spark gun's magical core is visible amid several reflectors. All damage dealt by a thundercrasher is sonic damage. On a critical hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 minute.

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** You overload the thundercrasher to emit chaotic sonic frequencies that soften earth and stone. When you next fire the thundercrasher it also partially liquefies any natural earth or stone surfaces within range of its [scatter](rules/traits/scatter-g-g.md "Scatter Weapon Trait") trait, making the area difficult terrain.
