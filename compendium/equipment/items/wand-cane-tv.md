# Wand Cane *Item 4*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [wand](rules/traits/wand.md "Wand Item Trait")  

- **Price** 100 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

Though it appears to be a basic cane, the inner workings of the wand cane are an intricate network of lenses and magical circuits, with a slot at the top to insert a wand. The wand cane then spends 1 minute attuning to the wand, after which the wand can be used through the cane.
