A gravemist taper is a conical candle with symbols of terror and death carved into the wax. The taper can be used as a catalyst when casting an [obscuring mist](compendium/spells/obscuring-mist.md) spell, burning the taper away, coloring the mist gray, and filling the mist with ghastly, shadowy shapes. The flat check to overcome the [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) state from the mist rises to 7, and a creature who fails such a check becomes [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened). This aspect of the spell has the emotion, [fear](rules/traits/fear.md), and [mental](rules/traits/mental.md) traits.
