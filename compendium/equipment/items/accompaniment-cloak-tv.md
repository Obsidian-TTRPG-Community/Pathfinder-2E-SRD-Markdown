This lush velvet capelet is embroidered with images of musicians playing a wide variety of instruments. The images animate when you make art, remaining embroidered, but smoothly unknitting and reknitting in time with your performance. The figures play music that perfectly accompanies your instrument, voice, or movements, granting you a +2 item bonus to [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks.

The crowd looks like the musicians on the garment and continues to accompany your [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks. You can Sustain this effect as described in the spell.
