# Sprite Apple *Item 3+*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

A sparkling candy coating covers a sprite apple. For 10 minutes after consuming a sprite apple, you shed bright light in a 20-foot emanation (and dim light for the next 20 feet). While shedding this light, you can't be [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) if you're visible, and if you're [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), you're [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) instead rather than being [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected). The light matches the vibrant color of the apple's candy coating. Creatures in the bright light are subject to another effect, depending on the type of apple.
