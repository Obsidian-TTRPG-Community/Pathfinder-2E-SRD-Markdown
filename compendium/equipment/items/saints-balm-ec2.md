This luminescent paste is made from the powdered bones of a long-forgotten saint, mixed with herbs and blessed by a priest. It typically comes in a tightly sealed, palmsized dish etched with holy symbols. Applying saints' balm to yourself or a creature within reach restores `3d8+10` Hit Points to the creature to which it's applied.
