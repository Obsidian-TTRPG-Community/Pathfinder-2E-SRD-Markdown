This steel shield contains a smoldering core of magma that never cools. Whenever the _reforging shield_'s current Hit Points are below its Break Threshold, the shield recovers 5 Hit Points at the start of its wielder's turn each round until it is no longer [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken). Each time a character [Repairs](rules/actions/repair.md) the shield, the shield recovers double the number of Hit Points. The shield has Hardness 15, HP 120, and BT 60.
