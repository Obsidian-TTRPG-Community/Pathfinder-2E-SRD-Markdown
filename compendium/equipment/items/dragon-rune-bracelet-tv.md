A dragon rune bracelet is a gold bangle formed around the scale of a famous dragon. The bracelet is etched with esoteric symbols or words in Draconic that indicate kinship with dragons. As many types of dragon rune bracelet exist as there are types of dragons, though bracelets associated with uncommon or rare dragons have the same rarity as the dragon.

While wearing a dragon rune bracelet, you gain a +2 item bonus to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks while interacting with dragons of the same type as the bracelet's scale (such as red dragons or cloud dragons). You also gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effects from any kind of dragon.
