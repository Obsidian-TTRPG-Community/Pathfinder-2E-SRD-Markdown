# Wind-up Wings *Item 3+*  
[clockwork](rules/traits/clockwork-g-g.md "Clockwork  Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Usage** attached <to a thrown weapon>
- **Category** Weapon

These delicate clockwork wings enable thrown weapons to soar through the air at high speeds, performing turns and other aerial maneuvers midflight. Wind-up wings also have different types of special effects depending on the type.

Wind-up wings must be attached to a thrown weapon and wound to function. A thrown weapon with an attached set of wind-up wings can't have anything else attached to it, or the wings cease to function.

Attaching or detaching a pair of wind-up wings to a thrown weapon requires a [repair kit](compendium/equipment/items/repair-kit.md), and the process takes 10 minutes. Winding an attached pair of wind-up wings takes three [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions. There are a variety of wind-up wings, with different effects.

### Variants

#### flutterback wind-up wings *Item 3*

- **Price**: 50 gp

When you make a thrown [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the weapon to which a pair of flutterback wind-up wings are attached, and the wings are wound, the wings fly the weapon back to your hand after the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) is complete. If your hands are full when the weapon returns, the wings hover in place three feet above the ground. At the end of your turn, the wings are wound down; they don't function again until wound. If you aren't holding the weapon when the flutterback wind-up wings become wound down, the weapon falls to the ground.

#### homing wind-up wings *Item 12*

- **Price**: 1800 gp

When you make a thrown [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the weapon to which a pair of homing wind-up wings are attached, and the wings are wound, the wings seek out your target, flying through cover and avoiding obstacles. You ignore the target's [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition and reduce the target's cover by one step (lesser cover to no cover, standard cover to lesser cover, or greater cover to standard cover). After the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) is complete, the wings are wound down; they don't function again until wound.
