A flingflenser is a goblin-designed weapon ending in an ovoid tube with a hatch and handle on the narrow end. A cluster of circular blades held together and attached to a black powder packet with a thin leather strap serves as ammunition and is loaded through the hatch before being fired with a flintlock or other external ignition mechanism. The flingflenser's sturdy design also places it among the more reliable goblin weapons.
