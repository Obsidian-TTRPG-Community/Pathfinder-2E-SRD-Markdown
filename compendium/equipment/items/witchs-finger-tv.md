Shaped like a pointed, gnarled finger on a stick, witch's finger is a frozen treat imbued with berries that lend it a blood-red hue. A popular tale claims Irriseni winter witches created this dessert, but the story is apocryphal; an enterprising ice cream shop owner in New Stetven invented the treat and, as a marketing ploy, the myth surrounding it. Taking a bite makes you feel warm. For 1 hour, you have cold resistance 3, and for 8 hours, the treat negates the damage you would take from severe environmental cold and reduces the damage you take from extreme cold to that of severe cold.
