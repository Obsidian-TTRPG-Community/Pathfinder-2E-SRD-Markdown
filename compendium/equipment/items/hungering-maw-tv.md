# Hungering Maw *Item 17*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 2200 gp
- **Bulk** —; **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** command; **Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a [possession](rules/traits/possession.md "Possession Effect Trait") effect; **Requirements** You are a master in Will saves.

A shining onyx gemstone clutched in a pair of black steel jaws, this pendant is a potent defense against [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) spirits and other beings who commandeer the bodies of others. When you Activate it, you gain a +4 item bonus to your saving throw against the triggering effect. If your result prevents you from being possessed, the creature that attempted to possess you is subject to a DC 37 [bind soul](compendium/spells/bind-soul.md) spell, which can trap it in the talisman as if it had recently died. The talisman's magic is exhausted after use, but a soul trapped this way remains imprisoned inside, as detailed in the spell description. Starting at the end of its next turn, the trapped creature gets a new save to end the effect at the end of each of its turns.
