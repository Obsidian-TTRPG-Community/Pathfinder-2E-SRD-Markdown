# Survey Map *Item 3*  
[uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** L
- **Hands** 1

Maps are uncommon. Most maps you can find are simple and functional. A survey map details a single location in excellent detail. One of these maps gives you a +1 item bonus to [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) checks and any skill checks to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), provided the checks are related to the location detailed on the map. The GM determines what maps are available in any location.

### Variants

#### Survey Map *Item 0*

- **Price**: 10 gp

#### Survey Map Atlas *Item 3*

- **Price**: 50 gp

Maps sometimes come in atlases, containing a number of maps of the same quality, often on similar topics. An atlas costs five times as much as a single map and requires both hands to use.
