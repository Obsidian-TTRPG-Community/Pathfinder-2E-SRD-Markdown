# Skittering Mask *Item 2+*  
[invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** worn mask

A skittering mask is a hand-carved, wooden, full-head mask that sports several holes along each side of the face. The first time each day that you begin your turn [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and within 25 feet of an enemy, skittering metallic insect legs emerge from the holes in the mask and [Step](rules/actions/step.md) 5 feet away from the nearest enemy, dragging your body along with the mask.

If more than one enemy is equidistant, the mask Steps away from one of them at random. The mask possesses no special senses and does not react to [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) or [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) enemies, nor can it distinguish that a creature not acting openly [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) is an enemy.

### Variants

#### skittering mask *Item 2*

- **Price**: 30 gp

#### greater skittering mask *Item 8*

- **Price**: 500 gp

The mask Steps 15 feet instead of 5 feet, and for 1 minute, each time you begin your turn [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and within 25 feet of an enemy, the mask Steps 15 feet away from the nearest enemy again. An ally can signal the mask with a single action, which has the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") and [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") traits. If the mask hears the signal, it attempts to move you towards that ally when it Steps away from the nearest enemy.
