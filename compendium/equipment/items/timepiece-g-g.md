# Timepiece *Item 1+*  
[clockwork](rules/traits/clockwork-g-g.md "Clockwork  Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  


Clockwork timepieces come in a variety of sizes and aesthetic styles, but they're all designed to display the accurate time of day down to the second.

Clockwork timepieces have a 24-hour activation cycle, after which they must wound in a process that takes 1 minute to complete.

### Variants

#### desktop clock *Item 1*

- **Price**: 10 gp

Desktop clocks have been designed to be small enough to only take up a quarter of a typical writing desk's surface area, but they're still too bulky and heavy to be lugged around casually.

#### grand clock *Item 3*

- **Price**: 50 gp

These towering, ten-foot-tall clocks have been painstakingly handcrafted by skilled artisans and feature loud chimes that can be heard hourly throughout a manor. Owners of grand clocks usually tend to display them prominently in a study, lounge area, or foyer.
