Granted by Katapesh's Pactmasters to influential merchants, exceptional Zephyr Guards, and favorite retainers, a pactmaster's grace is a crystal-studded blue platinum ring that sharpens the wearer's urban instincts. While invested, the ring grants a +2 item bonus to saving throws while you are in an urban setting, and this increases to a +3 item bonus if you have legendary proficiency in [Guild Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), [Katapesh Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), [Mercantile Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), or [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society). You also gain a +3 item bonus to [Mercantile Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) checks while wearing the ring, and you can attempt checks that require a proficiency rank of master in [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society).
