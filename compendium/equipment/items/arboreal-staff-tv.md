Rather than passing on when they feel their death approaching, a rare few elderly arboreals undergo a ritual of preservation. This rite fuses the arboreal's consciousness into a branch, allowing their spirit to live on within the object. The branch functions as a greater verdant staff, though the arboreal spirit allows only partners willing to safeguard nature to use the staff's spells. An arboreal who decides to become an arboreal staff is more connected to shorter-lived species than others of their kind. Most choose to endure to share their knowledge with future generations, but they take a long view in ways that can be frustrating to their wielders.

In addition to the activation and spells of a greater verdant staff, an arboreal staff can cast the spells it holds as if it were the staff's wielder, though it usually does so only to benefit a partner. The staff also has earthbind available as a 3rd-level spell.
