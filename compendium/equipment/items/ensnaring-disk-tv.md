This coin-sized metal disk is inscribed with arcane symbols and mounted on the inner surface of a shield. When you Activate the disk, the triggering weapon momentarily sticks to your shield, allowing you to attempt to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) it from its wielder with a +2 item bonus. If you roll a critical failure on this check, you get a failure instead.
