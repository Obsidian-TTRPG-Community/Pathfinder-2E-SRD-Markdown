# Net Launcher *Item 1*  
[rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 16 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 2 hands

This wide, hollow tube is two to three feet long and fires an unattached net at much greater range than one can be thrown.

A net launcher can be wielded while propped up on your shoulder or cradled under your arm. A net must be carefully folded to be launched without tangling. Properly loading a net into a net launcher takes 1 minute. A net fired with a net launcher can target a Medium or smaller creature within 40 feet, rather than 20 feet.
