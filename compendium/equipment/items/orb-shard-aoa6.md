# Orb Shard *Item 20*  
[artifact](rules/traits/artifact-gmg.md "Artifact Item Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** â€“; **Usage** held in 1 hand

A shard of the _Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ resembles a pointed length of crystal about the size and shape of a shortsword without a hilt. It functions as a shortsword that deals `2d6` extra damage to dragons.

Each _orb shard_ within 60 feet of the flawed orb of Gold Dragonkind increases the save DC against the orb by 1; thus, if all 13 remaining _orb shards_ are in this area, the save DC against the flawed orb increases from DC 30 to DC 43. A talented spellcaster or crafter can integrate an _orb shard_ back into the flawed orb to make this DC increase permanent.
