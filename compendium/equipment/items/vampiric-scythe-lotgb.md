- **Price** 3000 gp
- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** held in 2 hands

The blade of this +2 greater striking wounding scythe is sharp enough to produce a whistling sound when swung through the air. The shaft is made of ebony wood with a sickly shine to it, much like the shine of infected wounds and contaminated water.

- **Trigger**: An enemy critically succeeds at an attempt to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) you

If the triggering creature becomes [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained), you gain temporary Hit Points equal to the triggering creature's level. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.
