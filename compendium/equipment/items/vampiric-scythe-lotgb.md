- **Trigger**: An enemy critically succeeds at an attempt to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) you

**Effect** As the scythe leaves your hand, it drinks the triggering creature's blood. The creature must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or become [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) ([drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) on a critical failure). If the triggering creature becomes [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained), you gain temporary Hit Points equal to the triggering creature's level. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.

The scythe drains life essence from your opponent into you. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half the slashing damage the scythe dealt to the foe. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.
