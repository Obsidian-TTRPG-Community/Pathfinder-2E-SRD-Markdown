Originally formulated as a means of dissolving sovereign glue, this powerful solvent can break almost any adhesive's grip.

As universal solvent is particularly effective against sovereign glue, it automatically dissolves sovereign glue. It attempts to counteract any other adhesives, such as tanglefoot bags, with a counteract modifier depending on the type.
