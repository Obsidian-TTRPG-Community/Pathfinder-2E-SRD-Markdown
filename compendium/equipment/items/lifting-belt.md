# Lifting Belt *Item 4*  
[invested](rules/traits/invested.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Price** 80 gp
- **Usage** worn belt; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Worn

This wide leather belt grants you a +1 item bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks and increases the amount you can easily carry. You can carry Bulk equal to 6 + your Strength modifier before becoming [encumbered](rules/conditions.md#Encumbered), and you can hold and carry a total Bulk up to 11 + your Strength modifier.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You lift an object of up to 8 Bulk as though it were weightless. This requires two hands, and if the object is locked or otherwise held in place, you can attempt to [Force it Open](rules/actions/force-open.md) using [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) as part of this activation. The object still has its full weight and Bulk for all other purposesâ€”you just ignore that weight. The effect lasts until the end of your next turn.
