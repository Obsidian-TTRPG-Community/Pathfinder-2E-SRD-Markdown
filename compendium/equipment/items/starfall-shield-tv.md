You [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) up to three times. This movement doesn't trigger reactions and ignores difficult terrain. At the end of your movement, you deal `6d10` bludgeoning damage in a 10-foot emanation and `14d6` fire damage in a 40-foot emanation (DC 40 basic Reflex save, with the results applying to both the bludgeoning and fire damage). The space where you end your movement and all adjacent spaces become difficult terrain for 1 minute, and the shield glows red-hot for 10 minutes, during which it gains the effect of the greater flaming property rune.
