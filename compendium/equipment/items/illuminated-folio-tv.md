The pages of this part-spellbook, part-bestiary are illustrated with all manner of creatures, magical and mundane. The illustrations shift and move around the page when examined.

If your next action is to cast a conjuration spell prepared from this grimoire that summons one or more creatures, you summon creatures from the illuminated folio rather than their usual source. These summoned creatures appear as living illustrations, granting them resistance to physical damage equal to half their level and weakness 5 to fire and to any ability with the [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") trait.

They can also fold themselves up to pass through spaces only an inch or so wide as part of their movement.
