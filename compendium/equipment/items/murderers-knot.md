# Murderer's Knot *Item 7*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 66 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to a weapon
- **Activate** command; **Trigger** You damage a [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) creature with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) using the affixed weapon; **Requirements** You are an expert with the affixed weapon.

This black strand of leather is tied to look like a peace knot when the weapon is stowed, but it doesn't hamper drawing the weapon. When you activate the knot, the creature you damaged takes `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

If you have the Twist the Knife feat, the talisman instead deals [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to your sneak attack damage.
