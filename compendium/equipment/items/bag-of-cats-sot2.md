title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You shake the bag to produce a single cat. You cast a 3rd-level [summon animal](compendium/spells/summon-animal.md) to produce a leopard (Bestiary 52).

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You pull the bag over your head and it covers you completely. You then exit the bag in the form of a large cat.

You gain the effects of 3rd-level [animal form](compendium/spells/animal-form.md) but must use the cat battle form.
