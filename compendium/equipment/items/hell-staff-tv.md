A hell staff is a tall, pointed staff forged of red-tinted steel with Infernal inscriptions that march neatly down its sides. At its top sits an inverted ruby pyramid divided into nine sections.

Found mostly in Cheliax or other lands where diabolic influences hold sway, when used as a weapon the staff is a +3 greater striking axiomatic unholy staff. When you prepare this staff, if you're chaotic or good, you become [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) until your next daily preparations.

The staff's [summon lesser servitor](compendium/spells/summon-lesser-servitor-som.md) spell can be used only to summon animals with the [fiend](rules/traits/fiend.md) trait, devils, or hell hounds (at 4th level). Its [summon fiend](compendium/spells/summon-fiend.md) spell can summon only devils or hell hounds.
