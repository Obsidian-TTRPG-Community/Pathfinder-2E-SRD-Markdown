# Wig Of Holding *Item 3*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [extradimensional](rules/traits/extradimensional.md "Extradimensional Effect Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 45 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn headwear

Wigs of holding are created from planar fibers and contain small extradimensional spaces accessible within the hair.

They can hold up to four items of light Bulk inside them, and Bulk held within the wig of holding doesn't increase the Bulk of the wig itself. You can [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) with a wig of holding to put items inside or remove items from it, and you can do so more easily than with a mundane container. It only takes a single [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to withdraw these items, like a worn item, rather than taking two [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions, like a stowed item.
