# Wildwood Ink *Item 4+*  
[invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [tattoo](rules/traits/tattoo-lowg.md "Tattoo Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** tattooed on the body

These curving, delicate designs resemble leaves, vines, or creepers, most often wrapped around a limb, ear, or throat, or curled around specific muscles. They help you blend in among plants. You gain a +1 item bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks, which increases to +2 in forests.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger**: A creature would detect you by Seeking
- **Requirements**: You're in a forest or similar natural area

**Effect** The tattoo casts tree shape on you before you can be noticed. The duration of this spell is 10 minutes.

If you've already Activated the tattoo, you can supply a separate casting of tree shape to recharge the tattoo instead of having the spell's normal effect. This allows you to Activate the tattoo again in the same day. You can do so multiple times each day, but only as many times as you continue to cast [tree shape](compendium/spells/tree-shape.md) to recharge the tattoo after each use.
