# Reinforced Wheels *Item 0*  

- **Price** 5 sp
- **Category** Wheelchair Upgrade

The chair's wheels have been reinforced with tough, metal rims or a metal cap. While in the chair, you gain a wheel [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). Your wheel deals `1d4` bludgeoning damage and has the agile, [attached](rules/traits/attached.md "Attached Weapon Trait"), and [free-hand](rules/traits/free-hand.md "Free-Hand Weapon Trait") traits. A reinforced wheel is a simple melee weapon in the club weapon group. You can etch weapon runes onto reinforced wheels. A wheelchair can only have one attached weapon.
