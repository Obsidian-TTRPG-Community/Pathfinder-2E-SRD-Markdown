This stone figurine of a chariot pulled by two horses was used by Tekritanin adults during strategy game competitions. Sometimes, though, mischievous adolescents snatched pieces like this one for joyriding.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You place the figurine on the ground and roll it forward. As the chariot begins to move, it rapidly expands to the size of a Large heavy chariot pulled by two animated stone war horses. You can board the chariot and drive it up to 80 feet in a straight line. You can move through spaces occupied by creatures of size Medium or smaller, dealing `4d8+10` bludgeoning damage to those creatures. Affected creatures must attempt a DC 28 basic Reflex save; on a failure, a creature is knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone). The chariot returns to its figurine form once it stops moving.
