# Javelin of Lightning *Item 9*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 110 gp
- **Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of lightning bolt (4th level).
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

This item looks like a normal javelin carved with lightning-bolt motifs. If thrown without being activated, it wobbles in the air and fails to strike true. When you **Activate** the javelin, your command makes the carvings crackle with electricity. You then hurl the javelin. It shatters immediately after leaving your hand and unleashes its magic as a 4th-level [lightning bolt](compendium/spells/lightning-bolt.md) originating from your space. The bolt deals `5d12` electricity damage and has a Reflex save DC of 25.
