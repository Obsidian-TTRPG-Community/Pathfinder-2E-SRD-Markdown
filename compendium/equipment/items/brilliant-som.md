# Brilliant *Item 12+*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Usage** etched onto a weapon

This rune causes a weapon to transform into pure, brilliant energy. The weapon deals an additional `1d4` fire damage on a successful [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), as well as `1d4` good damage to fiends and `1d4` positive damage to undead.

On a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or be [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") command ([light](rules/traits/light.md))


You plunge your weapon into darkness to return the light. Attempt a counteract check with a counteract level of 5 and a +19 counteract modifier to end a magical [darkness](rules/traits/darkness.md "Darkness Effect Trait") effect whose area is within reach of the weapon.
