A Lesser Cube of Nex acts as a cube of force, but the effect lasts until you press the sixth face to [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) it, and the activation can be used once per hour. You must first [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) any previous activation before you use it again. Additionally, each Lesser Cube of Nex is attuned to a single school of magic. Within 5 feet of the Lesser Cube, all magic from that school is suppressed or impossible to cast, with the effects of a 10th-level [antimagic field](compendium/spells/antimagic-field.md) spell. While there are eight Lesser Cubes of Nex, each of the artifacts is unique, as there's only one Lesser Cube of Nex for each school of magic.
