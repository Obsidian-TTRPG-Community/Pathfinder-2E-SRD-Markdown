# Energizing *Item 6*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 250 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a weapon

A weapon with this rune can absorb energy damage to empower it.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") envision

- **Trigger**: You take acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage

**Effect** The weapon becomes imbued with the triggering energy type. It deals an additional `1d8` damage of the triggering type until the end of your next turn. As normal, if you use this reaction again during the duration, the damage doesn't combine; instead, change the `1d8` damage to the new triggering type of damage and change the duration to the end of your next turn.
