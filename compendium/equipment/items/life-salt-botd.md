# Life Salt *Item 5*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [positive](rules/traits/positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Price** 25 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)

This crystal vial contains salts blessed by channeling life-giving energies into waters purified by holy fire.

You can activate this vial by throwing it as a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). It's a simple thrown ranged weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") trait to the attack made with it. On a hit against an undead, life salt deals 1 [persistent positive damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and the undead must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be unable to attack you as long as it continues taking the [persistent positive damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

If you use a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action against any undead, this second effect ends, and the undead can attack you normally.
