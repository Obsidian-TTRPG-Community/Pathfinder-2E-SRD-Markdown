# Winder's Ring *Item 7*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 360 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** worn

This ring contains dozens of minute, interlocking bronze gears that buzz incessantly. The ring grants you a +1 item bonus to all [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) checks to construct or repair clockworks.

The winder's ring extends a winding key that fits any clockwork contraption or creature, allowing you to fully wind a clockwork device or creature in half the usual time. When you activate a winder's ring in this way, attempt a DC 16 flat check.

On a failure, the winder's ring exhausts itself, and you can't activate it again until the next time you make your daily preparations.

title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** The winder's ring transforms into a clockwork spy (Pathfinder Bestiary 3 48) that doesn't require winding and obeys your spoken commands for up to 1 hour. In this form, the winder's ring has the [minion](rules/traits/minion.md "Minion Creature Trait") trait. You can use this action again to return the clockwork spy to winder's ring form as long as you're adjacent to the clockwork spy. If the clockwork spy is slain, it reverts to its ring shape, and the winder's ring can't be activated again until 1 week has passed.
