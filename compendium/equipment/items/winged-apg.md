- **Usage** etched onto armor

This rune is a swirling glyph on the front of the armor. A large pair of transparent, ephemeral wings floats out from the back of the armor.

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** You trace the rune on the front of the breastplate and the armor's ephemeral wings grow tangible, granting you a fly Speed of 25 feet or your land Speed, whichever is slower. This effect lasts for 5 minutes or until you [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) it. Once the effect ends, the wings disappear completely, reappearing in their ephemeral form 1 hour later.
