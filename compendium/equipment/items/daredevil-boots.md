# Daredevil Boots *Item 10+*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn shoes

These brightly colored, soft-soled boots motivate you to perform risky stunts and grant you the agility to succeed. The boots grant you a +2 item bonus to [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) checks and a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [Tumble Through](rules/actions/tumble-through.md) an enemy's space.

The boots can grip solid surfaces and help you avoid a fall, allowing you to use the [Grab an Edge](rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md) reaction even if your hands aren't free. You treat falls as 10 feet shorter or, if you have the Cat Fall feat, treat your proficiency rank in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) as one degree better to determine the benefits of that feat. If you have Cat Fall and are already legendary in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics), you can choose the speed of your fall, from 60 feet per round up to normal falling speed.
