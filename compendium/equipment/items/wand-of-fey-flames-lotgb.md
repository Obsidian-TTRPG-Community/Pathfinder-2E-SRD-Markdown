title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day, plus overcharge

**Effect** You cast [faerie fire](compendium/spells/faerie-fire.md). For the duration of the spell, you can use the limning flames as a source for your magic. Creatures affected by your faerie fire must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or take a â€“2 status penalty to their Will saves against enchantment and illusions spells as long as they are affected by faerie fire.

You can cast an enchantment or illusion spell on such a creature up to a distance twice the spell's normal range. If the spell has a range of touch, or doesn't have a range, it is unaffected by the increase in range from the faerie fire.
