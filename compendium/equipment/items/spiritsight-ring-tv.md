# Spiritsight Ring *Item 6*  
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 225 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** worn

The opal set in the intricately carved ivory spiritsight ring eventually becomes translucent and tickles your finger whenever an incorporeal creature is nearby. When in the presence of a nearby incorporeal creature, even if it's within a solid object, you eventually detect the creature, though you might not do so instantly, and you can't pinpoint the location.

This acts as a vague sense, like humans' sense of smell. An incorporeal creature trying to hide its presence from this sense attempts a [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check against your [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC to hide from your vague sense, as normal for attempting to foil special senses. You gain a +2 item bonus when using the [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) action to find [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) or [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) incorporeal creatures within 30 feet of you.
