# Saurian Spike *Item 9+*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [spellheart](rules/traits/spellheart-som.md "Spellheart Equipment Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to armor or a weapon

This jagged, bony growth narrows to a sharp, pointed tip. Deep groves from some former battle scar its surface. The bearer of a saurian spike often feels a sudden surge in power and confidence.

- Armor You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet.
- Weapon (auditory, emotion, fear, visual) When you cast a polymorph spell by activating the spike, your battle form is exceptionally fearsome. Each enemy in a 30-foot emanation must succeed at a DC 27 Will saving throw or become [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) ([frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical failure).
