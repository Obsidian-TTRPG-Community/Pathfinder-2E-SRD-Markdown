# Handcuffs *Item 3+*  
[uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Held

Developed in Absalom and rarely used except by police forces in major cities due to their significant cost, handcuffs possess a ratcheting lock system in each cuff that allows them to be quickly cinched down on a captive's limbs, even if they're actively resisting.

To apply handcuffs, you must first grab or restrain your opponent, then attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check against the opponent's Fortitude DC. On a success, you lock one of the cuffs around your opponent's wrist. You can lock the other cuff to yourself or a stationary object within reach as an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action; to lock it to another creature (either the same opponent you just cuffed or a separate creature altogether), you must first grab or restrain that creature, as before, and then make an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check against its Fortitude DC. The DC to make the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check against your own wrist is 5, or 10 for an unattended object.

If you bind a creature to itself, it takes the same penalties as those imposed by manacles (Core Rulebook 290). If you bind a creature to another creature (including yourself), the two creatures are locked together and must remain in adjacent spaces, and both creatures gain the [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) condition as long as they are handcuffed. If you lock a creature to an immobile object, such as a bar or tree, the creature is [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized). (For creatures with an unusual physiology such as more or fewer limbs, the GM determines what effects handcuffs have, if any.) Handcuffs are unlocked via a key and are easier to slip out of than ordinary manacles. The chain between handcuffs can be [Broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) Open with a single [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check.
