This +1 striking flaming scimitar is always warm to the touch, nearly unbearably so. Lines of crackling flame radiate from carnelians affixed to its curved and blackened blade, and its pommel ends in a brilliant tassel of phoenix feathers. While you have a status bonus to at least one of your Speeds, your [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) with this scimitar that deal fire damage gain a +2 status bonus to their fire damage. The status bonus increases to +3 if the weapon has a greater striking rune and +4 for major striking.
