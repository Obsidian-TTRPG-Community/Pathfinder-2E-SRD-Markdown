# Stalker Bane Snare *Item 4*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [snare](rules/traits/snare.md "Snare Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 15 gp

This snare explodes in a burst of cloying powder that can cling to a creature stepping into its square. A creature that enters the square of a stalker bane snare must attempt a DC 20 Reflex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** Powder sticks to the target, causing it to leave behind telltale footprints. Being [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) makes the target [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden), rather than [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected), to creatures that could see it if it weren't [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible).
> - **Failure** Powder clumps on the target, constantly flaking away. Being [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) makes the target [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed), rather than [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) or [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected), to creatures that could see it if it weren't [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible).
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) until the end of its next turn.
