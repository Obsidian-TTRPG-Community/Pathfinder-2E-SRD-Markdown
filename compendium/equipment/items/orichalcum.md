# Orichalcum *Item 17+*  
[precious](rules/traits/precious.md "Precious Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  


The most rare and valuable skymetal, orichalcum is coveted for its incredible time-related magical properties. This dull, coppery metal isn't as physically sturdy as adamantine, but orichalcum's time-bending properties protect it, granting it greater Hardness and Hit Points. If an orichalcum item takes damage but isn't destroyed, it repairs itself completely 24 hours later.
