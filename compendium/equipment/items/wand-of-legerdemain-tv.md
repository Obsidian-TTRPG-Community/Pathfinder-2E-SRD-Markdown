[emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Requirements**: The last action you took this turn was to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from the wand

**Effect** You make yourself the center of attention. An illusory spotlight shines bright light upon your space as you pull inane objects from the wand's tip, such as confetti, silk flowers, streamers, or a long string of colorful kerchiefs knotted end to end. Each enemy within 30 feet must attempt a Will save against your spell DC, receiving a +4 circumstance bonus to the save if you or any of your allies recently threatened it or used [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) actions against it. On a failure, the creature becomes [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) with you until the end of your next turn. The fascination ends if the target is subject to a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) act, or if another creature succeeds at a [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) or [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check against it.

The spotlight follows you wherever you move. You can't be [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) while in the spotlight. The effect ends if you become [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), attempt a [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check, or [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the activation.

You can Sustain this Activation for up to 1 minute. Since you need to keep performing tricks, [Sustain an Activation](rules/actions/sustain-an-activation.md) has the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") trait. Sustaining extends the spotlight, and keeps [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) creatures [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), but doesn't cause creatures not already [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) to become [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated).
