This knife is a +1 striking returning dagger with a wide blade and thick wooden handle. A prayer for protection from evil magic is carved into the handle in tiny script, running around the handle in a spiral. The grooves of the carved prayer provide a good grip on the knife and make it easy to catch when it returns to your hand.

The dagger casts a 4th-level [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) targeting the most powerful spell effect affecting the creature you critically hit. The counteract check is +15.
