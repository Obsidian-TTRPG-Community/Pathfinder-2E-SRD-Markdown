# Leopard's Armor *Item 9*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 700 gp
- **Bulk** 2; **Usage** worn armor

Made of cobalt-colored steel rings that flow down the entire length of the garment, this +1 resilient chain mail includes an armored face covering. The armor is said to be based on the same armor once worn by Azure Leopard, one of Old-Mage Jatembe's magic warriors.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, envision

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You call upon the ferocity and grace of the leopard. The armor's rings flatten out to become a solid piece of flexible armor. You gain a +2 item bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks and [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks to [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md), but take a â€“2 penalty to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) and [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) checks.

This lasts for 1 hour, but you can Activate the armor again to revert it back to its original form.
```
