Bralani breath is a species of mint with small, green flowers, said to grow on battlefields where the opposing sides were equally matched. Sprigs of the flowers blow gently in a breeze of their own creation. If you cast [mage armor](compendium/spells/mage-armor.md) using bralani breath, you release a small blast of concussive air in an emanation of a size that depends on the catalyst's type.

Some unattended objects are pushed away from you. Large or smaller creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save equal to your spell save DC or be pushed the same distance away from you.
