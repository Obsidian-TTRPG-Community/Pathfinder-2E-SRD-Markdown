A growth gun is a +1 striking hand cannon made from the regenerative flesh of a hydra, troll, or other similar creature. It has an attached flesh sac that slowly replenishes one shot each round and can be loaded like a normal round of ammunition. It fires regenerating gobbets of flesh, bone, or teeth, determined by the damage type selected for its [modular](rules/traits/modular-logm.md "Modular Weapon Trait") trait. A growth gun can be fired underwater, though it's still limited by the selected damage type as normal.

- **Frequency**: once per minute

**Effect** Make a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). On a hit, the creature becomes covered in a mass of flesh that continues to grow on the target for a brief time. The creature becomes [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 round, after which the growth withers and falls off.
