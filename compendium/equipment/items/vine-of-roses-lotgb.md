# Vine Of Roses *Item 9*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [good](rules/traits/good.md "Good Alignment Trait")  [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 600 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 2 hands

This +1 striking disrupting spiked chain comes in a rich, green color with rose petals painted on the handle in varying shades of red and pink. The chain seems to banish nearby shadows.

You hold the chain out before you, and the weapon glows as bright as a torch. You can suppress this light by [Activating](rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) the weapon again.

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger**: You critically succeed at a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a fiend or undead

**Effect** The weapon unleashes its light in an attempt to destroy the target. The vine of roses casts a 3rd-level [searing light](compendium/spells/searing-light.md) spell with the triggering creature as the target. In place of a spell attack roll, make a weapon attack roll with the vine of roses using the same multiple attack penalty as the triggering [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).
