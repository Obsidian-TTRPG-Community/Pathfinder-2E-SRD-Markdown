Though the body of this +2 striking impactfulSoM boomerang (page 30) is riddled with glowing hairline cracks, the weapon feels reassuringly solid in the hand. If you damage a target that has been struck by a rime foil within the last round, you bruise its chilled body, and the target takes a –5-foot penalty to all its Speeds, or a –10-foot penalty on a critical hit.

Special The shattered plan pairs with the rime foil.
