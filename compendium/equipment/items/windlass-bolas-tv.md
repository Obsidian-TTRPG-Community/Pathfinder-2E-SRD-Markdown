```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

The cord of the bola snakes out as you throw it, allowing the weapon to wrap around a group of enemies. You use the bolas to attempt a ranged [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) against all creatures in a 5-foot radius burst within the weapon's first range increment. Roll a separate [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check for each target. Each attempt counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you have made all the attempts.
