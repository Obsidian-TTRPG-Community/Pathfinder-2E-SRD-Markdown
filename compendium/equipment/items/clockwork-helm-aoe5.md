# Clockwork Helm *Item 17*  
[clockwork](rules/traits/clockwork-g-g.md "Clockwork  Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 13000 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn headwear

Rotating gears cover the outside of this imposing helmet. In order to function, the device must be wound for 10 minutes once every 24 hours. The clockwork helm has a calming and focusing effect on the mind. If you're affected by a detrimental condition caused by a [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") or [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effect, each round at the beginning of your turn, the gears of the helmet unwind and reduce the value of the condition by 1.

This effect works only if the condition's value can normally be reduced by simply waiting; otherwise the helmet has no effect.

title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") envision

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Requirements**: You've wound the clockwork helm for 10 minutes within the last 24 hours

**Effect** You fire a beam of withering heat from the helmet's eye slits at a target. Make a spell or ranged attack roll (your choice) to affect the target. On a hit, the target takes `10d8` fire damage and is [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained).
