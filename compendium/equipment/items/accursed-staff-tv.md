# Accursed Staff *Item 6+*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [staff](rules/traits/staff.md "Staff Item Trait")  

- **Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

Iron strips line the body of an accursed staff, capping the bottom and folding into an intricate knot at the top. While wielding an accursed staff, you're empowered by the curses you inflict. If an enemy fails a saving throw against a spell you cast that has the [curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait") trait, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to double that spell's level. These temporary Hit Points last 10 minutes. The enemy must be a significant threat and can't have been a willing subject of the curse.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)


You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
