The bones of small animals decorate the cover of this tome, creating a pattern that resembles a gross perversion of [Pharasma](compendium/setting/deities/pharasma.md)'s holy symbol.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") command

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger**: An undead minion you summoned or created using a spell prepared from this grimoire takes damage that would bring it to 0 Hit Points

**Effect** You call out and demand the undead to remain, reaching out with tendrils of negative energy that preserves your minion so it might continue to serve you. Expend a spell slot in which you've prepared a [harm](compendium/spells/harm.md) spell to restore `1d8` Hit Points to your undead minion per level of the expended spell slot, before applying the damage. If this prevents the minion from being reduced to 0 Hit Points, it isn't destroyed.
