This jaunty cap can take the form and color of any type of hat you wish upon investing the item, but it always has a peacock feather jutting out from one side. You gain a +2 item bonus to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) and [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks while wearing the cap.

When you invest the cap, you either increase your Charisma score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.
