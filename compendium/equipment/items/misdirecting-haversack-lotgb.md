Documents inside the haversack become magically disguised as documents of a similar type but with misleading information. Anyone inspecting a document notices the disguise with a successful DC 20 [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check, but determining the actual text requires a successful DC 20 [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) check to [Decipher Writing](rules/actions/decipher-writing.md). This lasts until you use this activation again, which ends the effect for all previously disguised documents; until you use the second activation to end the effect for a single document; or until a document in the haversack remains outside the haversack for at least 1 hour, ending the effect for that document.

You revert one of the documents back to its original state.
