title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") Single Action ([>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") or more) [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per minute

**Effect** A ram-shaped blast of force slams into one foe that you can see within 60 feet. The number of actions you spend to [Activate this Item](rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) (from 1 to 3) determines the intensity of the force. The blow deals `2d6` force damage per action spent and pushes the target 5 feet per action spent. The target must attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes half damage and is pushed half the distance.
> - **Failure** The target takes full damage and is pushed the full distance.
> - **Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is pushed twice the distance.

- **Price**: 2700 gp

The ring deals `3d6` force damage per action spent, and the save DC is 32. When you activate the ring using 3 actions, you can disperse the force into multiple magical rams, targeting all creatures in a 30-foot cone instead of one target within 60 feet.
