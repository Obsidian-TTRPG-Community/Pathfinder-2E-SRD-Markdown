This heavy iron ring is shaped to look like the head of a ram, with curling horns.

title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

A ram-shaped blast of force slams into one foe that you can see within 60 feet. The number of actions you spend to [Activate this Item](rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) (from 1 to 3) determines the intensity of the force. The blow deals `2d6` force damage per action spent and pushes the target 5 feet per action spent. The target must attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes half damage and is pushed half the distance.
> - **Failure** The target takes full damage and is pushed the full distance.
> - **Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is pushed twice the distance.
