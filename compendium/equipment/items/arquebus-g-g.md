This is a long rifle that offers more range than the average firearm, though the long barrel and ferocious kickback make the weapon particularly unsteady unless a tripod or other stand is used to stabilize it. The arquebus is one of the most commonly used long guns among the soldiers of Dongun Hold and Alkenstar.
