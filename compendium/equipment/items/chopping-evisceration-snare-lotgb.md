[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [snare](rules/traits/snare.md "Snare Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 700 gp

An almost-impossible number of axes spring out at a target with lethal force. When a creature enters the snare's square, it's nearly buried beneath a storm of sharpened metal, which deals `16d8` slashing damage (DC 33 basic Reflex).
