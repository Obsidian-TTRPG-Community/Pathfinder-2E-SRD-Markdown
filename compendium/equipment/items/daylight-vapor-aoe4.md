This heavier-than-air mist emits a soft glow. While this poison lasts, it causes its victims to shine from within with agonizing, brilliant radiance. This effect has the [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait") trait (although the poison itself doesn't, so only the [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait") effect can be counteracted by [darkness](rules/traits/darkness.md "Darkness Effect Trait") effects). The [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition from daylight vapor can't be removed while the poison lasts, and when the victim enters an area of magical darkness, the poison attempts to counteract the darkness with a counteract modifier of +21. If the poison fails, it can't attempt to counteract the same darkness again.
