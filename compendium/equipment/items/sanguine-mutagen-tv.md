You gain greatly increased blood production, filtering out contagions and boosting your endurance but causing your body to bloat with blood.

Benefit You gain an item bonus to Fortitude and Reflex saves. This bonus improves when you attempt a save against an effect that has the [disease](rules/traits/disease.md "Disease Effect Trait") trait, [poison](rules/traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait") trait, or would give you the [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) condition.

Drawback Whenever you take piercing or slashing damage, you take `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
