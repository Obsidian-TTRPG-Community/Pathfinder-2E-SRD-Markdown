This prosthetic eye resembles that of a bird of prey. Along with the abilities of the magical prosthetic eye, it allows you to strike foes at greater range and with impressive accuracy.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") envision

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** You become keenly aware of your foes, even those seemingly out of reach. For 1 minute, you can close your eyes as a free action to see through a ranged weapon you're wielding, which reduces the penalty for firing into your weapon's second range increment from â€“2 to 0. This effect doesn't negate the [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) condition.
