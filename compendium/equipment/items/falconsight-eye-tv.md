This prosthetic eye resembles that of a bird of prey. Along with the abilities of the magical prosthetic eye, it allows you to strike foes at greater range and with impressive accuracy.

You become keenly aware of your foes, even those seemingly out of reach. For 1 minute, you can close your eyes as a free action to see through a ranged weapon you're wielding, which reduces the penalty for firing into your weapon's second range increment from â€“2 to 0. This effect doesn't negate the [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) condition.
