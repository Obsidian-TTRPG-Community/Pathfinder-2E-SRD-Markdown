# Sneezing Powder *Item 2*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [inhaled](rules/traits/inhaled.md "Inhaled Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 7 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 2 hands
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

You can toss sneezing powder at an adjacent creature as an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action. The target must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid sneezing. On a failed save, the creature sneezes uncontrollably, becoming [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is instead [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for 3 rounds.
