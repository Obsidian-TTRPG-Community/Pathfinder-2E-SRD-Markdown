A spiked glove is attached to the front of this buckler (Hardness 6, HP 24, BT 12), functioning as +1 striking shield spikes. Perforations and slits line the defensive side, shining bright light through them when the item's magic is activated.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You activate the shield's inner light. Attempt a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the duelist's beacon. On a hit, the target must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target uses the result one degree of success worse than it rolled for its Fortitude save.
