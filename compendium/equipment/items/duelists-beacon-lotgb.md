# Duelist's Beacon *Item 8*  
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 450 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in one hand

A spiked glove is attached to the front of this buckler (Hardness 6, HP 24, BT 12), functioning as +1 striking shield spikes. Perforations and slits line the defensive side, shining bright light through them when the item's magic is activated.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") envision

- **Frequency**: once per hour

**Effect** You activate the shield's inner light. Attempt a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the duelist's beacon. On a hit, the target must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target uses the result one degree of success worse than it rolled for its Fortitude save.
