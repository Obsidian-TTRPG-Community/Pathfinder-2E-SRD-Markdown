This bottle of delicately sweet ice wine has the properties of alcohol (Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide 120). Made exclusively from grapes frozen in the Mana Wastes' erratic surge storms, Alkenstar ice wine finds a ready market among Geb, though undead are still immune to the drug's listed effects.

The listed price is for a mediocre vintage, but finer vintages are higher level and commensurately more expensive.
