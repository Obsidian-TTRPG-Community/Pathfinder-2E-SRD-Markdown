### Variants

#### Arbiter *Item 3*

- **Price**: 7 gp

This coin has small wings like an arbiter, the messenger and diplomat aeon. When you activate the coin, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check, which increases to a +3 circumstance bonus to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on a lawful creature.

#### Bythos *Item 10*

- **Price**: 200 gp

This cog-like coin bears an hourglass on one side and the four-armed silhouette of a bythos—aeons that steward over time—on the other. When activated, you catch a glimpse of your body moving on one of its potential timelines in response to danger and you follow those movements to dodge. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the attack, and after resolving the attack, you can [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) up to 10 feet without triggering reactions. If you have the Nimble Roll feat and the attack misses, you can [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) up to 20 feet instead.
