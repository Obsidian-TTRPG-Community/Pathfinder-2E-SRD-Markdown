# Firedrake *Item 8*  
[huge](rules/traits/huge-b1.md "Huge Size Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 1000 gp
- **Usage** mounted (black powder)

This alchemical black powder hybrid siege weapon uses a blast of black powder to spray alchemical fire from a long metal nozzle, often sculpted or painted with designs resembling a dragon's neck and head. The nozzle turns on a ratcheted, rotating disc with a reservoir in the center to hold a barrel full of combustible alchemical liquid, using black powder to propel the fire. This main structure is atop a wheeled cart to allow it to be easily moved. Unlike most mounted siege weapons, a firedrake is intended to be wheeled out into the thick of a skirmish rather than shooting from a distance.
