# Aeon Stone (Clear Quartz Octagon) *Item 4*  
[invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 90 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** worn

This clear quartz stone appears to have been smashed and then repaired by pouring molten copper into the cracks and fitting the shards back together using the copper as a sort of mortar. When a non-magical item in your possession with a value of 90 gp or less and a Bulk of 1 Bulk or less would become [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken), this aeon stone automatically activates, preventing the item from breaking by restoring the item's current Hit Points to the item's maximum Hit Points. The stone then turns permanently into a dull gray aeon stone. The stone's resonant power allows you to cast 1st-level [mending](compendium/spells/mending.md) as a divine innate spell once per day.
