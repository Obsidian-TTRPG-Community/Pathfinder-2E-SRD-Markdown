While those who appreciate bagpipes may like the sound of this gray reed and black leather instrument, its real purpose is to sow turmoil against a performer's enemies, spreading discord with each note. While playing the bagpipes, you gain a +1 item bonus to [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks and to [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks made to [Demoralize](rules/actions/demoralize.md).
