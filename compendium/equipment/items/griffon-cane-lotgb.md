A griffon cane's splayed foot enables it to stand upright by itself. A griffon cane deals `1d6` bludgeoning damage, has the [backswing](rules/traits/backswing.md "Backswing Weapon Trait") and [two-hand <d10>](rules/traits/two-hand-d10.md "Two-Hand Weapon Trait") traits, and is a martial melee weapon in the club weapon group.
