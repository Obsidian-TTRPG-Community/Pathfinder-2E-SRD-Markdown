The serrated blade of this +1 striking dagger has a greenish tinge, and the hilt is sculpted to look like the head of a serpent about to strike. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with the dagger of venom, the target becomes [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) unless it succeeds at a DC 19 Fortitude save. This is a [poison](rules/traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait") effect. In addition, you can activate the dagger to poison a creature with a more potent poison.
