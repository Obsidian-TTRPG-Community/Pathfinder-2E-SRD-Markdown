# Unholy Water *Item 1*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [evil](rules/traits/evil.md "Evil Alignment Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait")  

- **Price** 3 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)

An evil deity's malice lies within this vial of water. You activate a vial of unholy water by throwing it as a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). It's a simple thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") trait to the attack made with it.

Unholy water deals `1d6` evil damage and 1 evil [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage.

It damages only celestials and creatures that have a weakness to evil damage.
