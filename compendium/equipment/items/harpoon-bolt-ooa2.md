# Harpoon Bolt *Item 4*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 15 gp
- **Ammunition** round

This iron spike can be fitted into the barrel of a two-handed firearm that doesn't have the scatter property with an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action. The spike is attached to a 50-foot-long coil of rope held in a simple spool that can be attached to a weapon's barrel. The weight and awkward balance of the bolt and its spool reduce the range of the weapon by 10 feet when fired. A creature hit by a harpoon bolt takes normal damage from the shot and must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save. On a failure, the harpoon bolt becomes lodged in its body.

Once a harpoon bolt is lodged, a creature can remove the harpoon bolt with a DC 18 check to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) or [Force Open](rules/actions/force-open.md), but on a failure, the creature takes `1d4` piercing damage. As long as the harpoon bolt remains lodged, the creature can't move more than 50 feet away from you. You can attempt to [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) a creature by tugging on the rope attached to the harpoon bolt, even if it isn't within your reach, but if you fail this attempt, the bolt rips free, causing `1d4` piercing damage to the target but releasing it from the bolt. If you reload, drop, or fire the firearm again, the creature is no longer limited in its movement. Once a harpoon bolt is removed from a creature, the bolt, its rope, and the spool all decay away, consumed by the same magic that empowers the unusual ammunition to function in the first place.
