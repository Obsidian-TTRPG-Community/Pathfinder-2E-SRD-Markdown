# Glue Bullet *Item 4*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 16 gp

- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

These cartridges are filled with sticky clear glue. When a glue bullet hits, a syrupy webbing coats the target and sticks to the ground or a nearby surface, hindering their movement. The target takes a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for `2d4` rounds, or until it Escapes against a DC of 18. On a critical hit, the target is also [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) until it Escapes.
