# Vine Arrow *Item 3*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 10 gp
- **Ammunition** [arrow](compendium/equipment/items/arrow.md)
- **Activate** command

Leafy stalks protrude from the shaft of this rustic arrow. When an activated vine arrow hits a target, the arrow's shaft splits and grows, wrapping the target in vines. The target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for `2d4` rounds, or until it [Escapes](rules/actions/escape.md) against a DC of 19. On a critical hit, the target is also [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) until it [Escapes](rules/actions/escape.md).
