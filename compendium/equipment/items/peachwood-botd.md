# Peachwood *Item 8+*  
[precious](rules/traits/precious.md "Precious Item Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  


Peachwood, often cultivated by Pharasmin priests, can ward against undeadâ€”even incorporeal ones. However, the wood loses its magical properties when it comes in contact with metal, requiring advanced carpentry to make full use of it.
