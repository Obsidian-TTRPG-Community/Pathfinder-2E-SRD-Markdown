# Fake Blood Pack *Item 0*  
[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  

- **Price** 1 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn under light armor or clothes

Adventurers have found a number of uses for these animal bloodâ€“filled bladders, which were originally used in theatrical productions. Whenever you take slashing or piercing damage with the fake blood pack under your clothes or armor, roll a DC 11 flat check. On a success, the blood pack is punctured.

You or an ally can puncture the [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) pack intentionally.

When faking an injury, the blood pack grants a +2 item bonus to relevant [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks, such as to [Lie](rules/actions/lie.md) about being injured. Abilities that trigger when a creature deals bleed damage, determine if a creature is bleeding, or are otherwise based on bleed damage don't trigger or apply for blood from a fake blood pack, which might mean creatures with such abilities automatically realize the ruse.
