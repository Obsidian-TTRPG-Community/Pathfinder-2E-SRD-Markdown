# Armor of the Holy Warrior *Item 16*  
[divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [good](rules/traits/good.md "Good Alignment Trait")  [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 9000 gp
- **Bulk** 3; **Usage** worn armor

Based on the armors used by the holy warriors who served under General Arnisant in the Shining Crusade, this well-polished +2 greater resilient half plate is decorated with religious motifs and carved with sacred scripture.

While wearing armor of the holy warrior, your item bonus from the greater resilient rune increases from +2 to +3; if you upgrade to a major resilient rune, the item bonus instead increases from +3 to +4. An undead that critically fails an unarmed attack against you while you wear this armor takes `1d6` positive damage.

If you are evil, you're [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) while wearing the armor. If you're undead, you also take `2d6` positive damage each round that you wear the armor.
