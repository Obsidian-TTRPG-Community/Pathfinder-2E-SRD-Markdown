Hendrid Pratchett himself designed this custom skull-topped +1 striking exquisite sword cane and had it gilded in high-quality gold. Its first victim was the very smith whom Pratchett commissioned to craft the weapon, so the means of its construction are a secret known only to Pratchett. The magic of the Reaper's Lancet applies to both the blade and the sheath, making them each effectively a +1 striking weapon, but only if both are wielded by the same creatureâ€”if the two components are shared between creatures, only the blade retains the rune's magic.

Reaper's Lancet has a [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) reservoir inside the skull that automatically applies a new dose of poison to the blade after the previous dose was expended with a successful [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). The reservoir must be filled manually (a process requiring 1 minute) and is large enough to hold only 3 doses at a time. Any sort of injury-delivered poison can be placed in it, though all doses must be of the same poison. The Price of the poison is not reflected in this weapon's listed Price.
