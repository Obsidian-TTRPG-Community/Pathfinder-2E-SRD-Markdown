# Impossible *Item 20*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 70000 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a weapon
- **Category** Rune

This rune makes a weapon capable of impossible offense and defense. The etched weapon is immune to dispel magic and similar effects that could counteract its magic. If it's a ranged weapon or thrown weapon, its range increment is doubled.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")
[teleportation](rules/traits/teleportation.md "Teleportation Effect Trait")  

You and the weapon flash to a perfect attacking position, then return to where you started. Make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the etched weapon against one creature you can see, even if the target is beyond the weapon's reach or range. On this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), ignore any circumstance penalty, status penalty, and range increment penalty.
