# Scope Of Limning *Item 10*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 900 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** attached <to firearm (scope)>
- **Category** Scope

The dwarven gunsmiths of Dongun Hold originally created these scopes to help them clear out vermin in underground areas. This scope captures the sound that echoes off a creature hit by the firearm and transforms it into light, illuminating the target for all to see.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) ([auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md), [light](rules/traits/light.md), [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md))


If your next [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) from the weapon to which the scope is attached hits a creature, the sound of the impact transforms into light, causing the creature to glow until the end of your next turn. A visible creature can't be [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) while they glow. If a creature is [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), they're [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) while glowing, rather than being [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected). Because the effect requires a solid impact, incorporeal creatures are unaffected unless the bullet can deal force damage or has the effects of the [ghost touch](compendium/equipment/items/ghost-touch.md) property rune.
