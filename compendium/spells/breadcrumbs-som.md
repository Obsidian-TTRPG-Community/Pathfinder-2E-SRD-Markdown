# Breadcrumbs *Spell 1*   
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** 1 minute 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 willing creature
- **Duration**1 hour

You protect your target from going astray in [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) territory by tracking where it's already been, helping it deduce where it still needs to go. The target leaves a glittering trail behind it that lasts for the spell's duration.

This trail doesn't denote the direction or the order of its pathâ€”it merely indicates where the target has moved during the spell's duration.

**Heightened (2nd)** The duration increases to 8 hours.

**Heightened (3rd)** The duration increases to last until your next daily preparations.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
