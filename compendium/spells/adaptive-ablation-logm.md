# Adaptive Ablation *Focus 4*   
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  

- **Domains** [change](compendium/setting/domains.md#Change)
- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**: You take acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage.
- 
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You shift yourself to adapt to the mystical wavelengths of the energy damage, protecting yourself from further harm. You gain resistance 5 to the triggering energy type; you gain this resistance after you take the triggering damage, so it applies only to future damage you take during the duration.

**Heightened (+ 2)** Increase the resistance by 5.
