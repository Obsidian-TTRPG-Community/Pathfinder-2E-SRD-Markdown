A small ball of flame appears in the palm of your hand, and you lash out with it either in melee or at range. Make a spell attack roll against your target's AC. This is normally a ranged attack, but you can also make a melee attack against a creature in your unarmed reach. On a success, you deal `1d4` fire damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On a critical success, the target takes double damage and `1d4` [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the damage by `1d4` and the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) on a critical hit by `1d4`.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
