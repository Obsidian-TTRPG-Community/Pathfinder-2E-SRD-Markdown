# Sudden Blight *Spell 2*   
[necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Area**: 20-foot burst
- **Saving Throw**:  basic Fortitude

You accelerate the processes of decay in the area. Each living creature in the area takes `2d10` negative damage (basic Fortitude save). A creature afflicted by a disease takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to this save.

You can also direct the blight to rot all Small and Tiny non-creature plants in the area, eliminating non-magical undergrowth and any resulting difficult terrain, cover, and concealment. Sudden blight attempts to counteract any [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") effect on the plants before withering them.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d10`.
