- **Domains**: [cold](compendium/setting/domains.md#Cold)

- **Area**15-foot emanation centered on you

You supercool the nearby air, forming a cloud of dancing ice crystals in an emanation around you. A creature other than you that enters the area or ends its turn within the area takes `2d6` cold damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. The crystals scatter and refract light; if a [light](rules/traits/light.md) effect enters diamond dust's area, any creatures that effect goes on to affect gain a +2 status bonus to AC and saves against it.

You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) this spell.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
