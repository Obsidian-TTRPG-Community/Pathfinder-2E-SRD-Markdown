# Weapon Surge *Focus 1*   
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Domains** [zeal](compendium/setting/domains.md#Zeal)
- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 weapon you're wielding

Holding your weapon aloft, you fill it with divine energy. On your next [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with that weapon before the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to the attack roll and the weapon deals an additional die of damage. If the weapon has a striking rune, this instead increases the number of dice from the striking rune by 1 (to a maximum of 3 extra weapon dice)

If the target weapon leaves your possession, weapon surge immediately ends.
