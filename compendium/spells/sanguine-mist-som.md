# Sanguine Mist *Spell 4*   
[death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 60 foot
- **Area**: 10-foot burst
- **Saving Throw**:  basic Fortitude
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

You unleash a cloud of foul, blood-sucking fog that drains the vitality from the living to bolster your own. Each living creature in the area when you [Cast the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), aside from you, takes `6d6` negative damage with a basic Fortitude save. Creatures in the area are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed), and all creatures outside the cloud become [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to creatures within it.

The first time each round you Sustain this Spell on subsequent turns, living creatures in the area take an additional `2d6` negative damage with another basic Fortitude save. You also gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage a single creature took when you Sustained the spell this turn; calculate these temporary Hit Points using the creature that took the most damage. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The initial damage increases by `2d6` and the secondary damage increases by `1d6`.
