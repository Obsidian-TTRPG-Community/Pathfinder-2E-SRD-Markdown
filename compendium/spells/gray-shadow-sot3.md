# Gray Shadow *Spell 6*   
[necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [shadow](rules/traits/shadow.md "Shadow General Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) creature
- **Duration**: sustained

You pray over a [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) creature, drawing its shadow into your service as long as its owner is stooped at death's door. You summon a greater shadow in a space adjacent to the [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) creature. The greater shadow has its usual stats (Pathfinder Bestiary 289), with the following modifications:

- The greater shadow's shadow hand [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) deals an additional `1d8` poison damage.
- When you [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), you can use the greater shadow's location as the origin point instead of your own location. Upon doing so, the greater shadow immediately disappears. If the [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) creature targeted by this spell dies or regains consciousness, the greater shadow disappears and this spell ends.
