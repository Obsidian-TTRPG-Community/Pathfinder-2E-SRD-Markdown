# Organsight *Spell 3*   
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md)  [revelation](rules/traits/revelation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 living or undead creature that has organs
- **Duration**1 minute

You see the target as though it's dissected and arrayed before you. For the duration, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) checks against the target that depend on its organs, but a â€“2 circumstance penalty on [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) checks depending on seeing its skin.

When you [Cast the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), attempt a special [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) check using [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) to spot and discern a vital organ. If you have a [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill appropriate to the creature, you can use that skill instead of [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine). If you succeed, the next time you deal piercing or slashing damage to the target with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or spell, you deal `4d6` additional precision damage. Once on each of your subsequent turns, you can use a single action to attempt the special [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) check again. The extra damage isn't cumulative, so making the check more than once before a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or spell has no extra benefit.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The precision damage increases by `1d6`.
