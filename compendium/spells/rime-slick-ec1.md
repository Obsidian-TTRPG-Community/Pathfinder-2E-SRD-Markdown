- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")

You call down a chill wind. When you Cast this Spell, you deal `2d4` cold damage to each creature in the area (basic Reflex save). If a creature in the area critically fails its Reflex save and was standing, it also falls [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).

You also create a layer of ice on all surfaces in the area, which become difficult terrain. Unattended objects in the area become slick with ice, and picking them up requires a successful Reflex save or [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check against your spell DC. The ice melts on any object that takes fire damage as well as in any square included in the area of a higher-level spell or effect with the [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait") trait.

**Heightened (5th)** The damage increases to `8d4` cold damage and the area is a 30-foot burst.

**Heightened (8th)** The damage increases to `14d4` cold damage and the area is a 60-foot burst.
