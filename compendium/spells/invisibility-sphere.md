# Invisibility Sphere *Spell 3*   
[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**: 10-foot emanation
- **Targets**: you and any number of creatures in range
- **Duration**: 10 minutes

You and all targets are [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) except to each other as long as you remain within the spell's area. If a creature made [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) by this spell leaves the spell's area, it becomes visible and remains so even if it returns to the spell's area. If any creature made [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) by this spell uses a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action, the spell ends after the [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action is completed.

While exploring, it's easy to move together slowly and remain [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible). This is untenable in a battle, however. Once an encounter begins, creatures remain [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) until at most the end of the first round, at which point the spell ends.

**Heightened (5th)** The duration increases to 1 hour.
