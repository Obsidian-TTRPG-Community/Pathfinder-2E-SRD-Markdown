# Dancing Shield *Spell 2*   
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 60 foot
- **Targets**: 1 touched shield and 1 willing creature
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

You levitate the touched shield and orbit it around a nearby ally. When you [Cast the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) and [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), the shield uses the [Raise a Shield](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md) action to protect the target creature.

**Heightened (4th)** If you have the Shield Block reaction, you can use your reaction to have the target shield use Shield Block when the target creature would take damage from a physical attack, in addition to the usual trigger. In this case, Shield Block protects the target creature, rather than you. Since the shield is using Shield Block and not you, additional effects or abilities that normally apply when you Shield Block don't apply.
