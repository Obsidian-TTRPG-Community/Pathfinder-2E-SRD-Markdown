You unleash a beam of divine energy. Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity or if your deity is true neutral. Make a ranged spell attack roll against the target's AC. On a hit, the target takes damage of the chosen alignment type equal to `1d4` + your spellcasting ability modifier (double damage on a critical hit). The spell gains the trait of the alignment you chose.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d4`.
