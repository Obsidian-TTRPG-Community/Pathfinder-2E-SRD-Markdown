# Healing Plaster *Cantrip 1*   
[cantrip](rules/traits/cantrip.md "Cantrip Spell Trait")  [earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: 5 foot
- **Targets**: a handful of dirt or mud
- **Duration**: 10 minutes

You purify some dirt or mud into a pliable, claylike plaster that can aid in clotting and healing. This restorative substance can be used in lieu of healer's tools for [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) checks to [Administer First Aid](rules/actions/administer-first-aid.md) or [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md). If the plaster isn't used within the spell's duration, or if you [Cast the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) again before using the plaster, it reverts to being normal non-magical earth.

**Heightened (3rd)** The plaster grants anyone using it to [Administer First Aid](rules/actions/administer-first-aid.md) or [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md) a +1 item bonus to the [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
