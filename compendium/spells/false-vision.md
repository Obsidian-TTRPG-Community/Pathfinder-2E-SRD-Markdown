# False Vision *Spell 5*   
[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** 10 minutes 
- **Range**: touch
- **Area**: 100-foot burst
- **Duration**: until the next time you make your daily preparations

You create a false image that fools any attempts to scry on an area. Any [scrying](compendium/spells/scrying.md) spell sees, hears, smells, and otherwise detects whatever you wish within the area, rather than what is actually in the area. You can [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) each round to change the illusion as you desire, including playing out a complex scene. If the [scrying](compendium/spells/scrying.md) spell is of a higher level than false vision, the scryer can attempt a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check to 0, though even if they're successful, they can't learn what's truly going on in the area.
