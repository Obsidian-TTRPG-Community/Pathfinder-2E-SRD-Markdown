# Deity's Strike *Spell 7*   
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  [force](rules/traits/force.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](rules/traits/divine.md)
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Requirements**You have a deity.
- **Range**500 foot
- **Targets**1 creature (see text)

A manifested version of your deity's favored weapon appears in the air above and attacks the target, using your spell attack roll. On a hit, the weapon deals `7d12` force damage, or double damage on a critical hit.

After the attack, whether it succeeds or fails, divine energy bursts from the weapon in a shock wave. It emits in a 10-foot-wide, 30-foot-long line starting from the target and continuing in a direction you choose. Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful)

Your target and any other creatures within the area of the spell take `5d6` damage of the chosen alignment type, with a basic Reflex save. The spell gains the trait of the alignment you choose. If your deity is true neutral, the weapon doesn't create a shock wave.

**Heightened (9th)** The force damage increases by `1d12` and the alignment damage increases by `1d6`.
