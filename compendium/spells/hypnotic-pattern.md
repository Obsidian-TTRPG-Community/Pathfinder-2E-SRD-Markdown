[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot

- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You create a pattern of shifting colors that hovers in the air in a geometric cloud. Creatures are [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) while inside the pattern. In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, when it enters the pattern, when it ends its turn within the pattern, or if it uses a [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) or [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action on the pattern. A creature currently [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) by the pattern doesn't attempt new saves.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The target is [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) by the pattern.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) by the pattern. While it remains [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), it can't use reactions.
