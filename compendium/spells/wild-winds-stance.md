[air](rules/traits/air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  [stance](rules/traits/stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- 
- **Duration**: until you leave the stance

You take on the stance of the flowing winds, sending out waves of energy at a distance. You can make wind crash unarmed [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) as ranged [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) against targets within 30 feet. These deal `1d6` bludgeoning damage, use the brawling group, and have the agile, nonlethal, [propulsive](rules/traits/propulsive.md "Propulsive Weapon Trait"), and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits. Wind crash [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) ignore concealment and all cover.

While in wild winds stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks.
