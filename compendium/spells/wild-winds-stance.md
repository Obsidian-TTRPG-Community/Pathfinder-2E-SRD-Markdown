- **Duration**until you leave the stance

You take on the stance of the flowing winds, sending out waves of energy at a distance. You can make wind crash unarmed [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) as ranged [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) against targets within 30 feet. These deal `1d6` bludgeoning damage, use the brawling group, and have the agile, nonlethal, [propulsive](rules/traits/propulsive.md), and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits. Wind crash [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) ignore concealment and all cover.

While in wild winds stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks.
