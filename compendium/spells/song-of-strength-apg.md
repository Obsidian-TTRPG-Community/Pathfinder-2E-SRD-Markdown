- **Area**: 60-foot emanation
- **Duration**: 1 round

You bolster your allies' physical strength with a hearty exhortation. You and your allies gain a +1 status bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks and to their DCs against [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill actions such as [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md), [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md), and [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md).

Special If you have the [inspire heroics](compendium/spells/inspire-heroics.md) composition spell, you can use that composition to improve the bonus granted by song of strength in the same way as inspire courage or inspire defense.
