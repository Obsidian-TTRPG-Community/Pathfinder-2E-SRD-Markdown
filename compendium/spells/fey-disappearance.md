[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md "Sorcerer Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer

- 
- **Duration**: until the end of your next turn

You become [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) and ignore natural difficult terrain (such as underbrush). Any [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action you use ends this invisibility, but you still ignore natural difficult terrain.

**Heightened (5th)** If you use a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action, the invisibility doesn't end.
