# Illusory Disguise *Spell 1*   
[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 hour

You create an illusion that causes you to appear as another creature of the same body shape, and with roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds), as yourself. The disguise is typically good enough to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell doesn't change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You can change the appearance of your clothing and worn items, such as making your armor look like a dress. Held items are unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true appearance.

Casting illusory disguise counts as setting up a disguise for the [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) use of [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception); it ignores any circumstance penalties you might take for disguising yourself as a dissimilar creature, it gives you a +4 status bonus to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks to prevent others from seeing through your disguise, and you add your level even if you're untrained. You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) this spell.

**Heightened (2nd)** The spell also disguises your voice and [scent](rules/abilities/scent.md), and it gains the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") and [olfactory](rules/traits/olfactory-b1.md "Olfactory Effect Trait") traits.

**Heightened (3rd)** You can appear as any creature of the same size, even a specific individual. You must have seen an individual to take on their appearance. The spell also disguises your voice and [scent](rules/abilities/scent.md), and it gains the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") trait.
