# Medusa's Wrath *Focus 8*   
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- 

You make an attack filled with a medusa's petrifying power.

Make an unarmed [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the following additional effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait") trait. On a failed save, the [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) condition increases by 1 (2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) condition from medusa's wrath, it is [petrified](rules/conditions.md#Petrified) permanently. The spell ends if the creature is [petrified](rules/conditions.md#Petrified) or the [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) condition is removed.
> - **Success** As critical success, but the target is initially [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed).
