# Draw The Lightning *Spell 4*   
[electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature that is either taller than you or higher in the air than you
- **Saving Throw**: Reflex
- **Duration**: 1 minute

Calling out to the skies, you summon a bolt of lightning to strike through a foe above you and down into your weapon or your body, charging it with electrical power.

You must hold your weapon or an empty hand aloft as part of this spell's somatic component. When you do, a bolt of lightning descends from a storm cloud in the air above your and through the target, dealing `3d12` electricity damage with a basic Reflex save. For the rest of the spell's duration, your first [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) each round with the weapon you held aloft (or with your unarmed attacks if you held an empty hand aloft) deals an additional `1d12` electricity damage.

The spell creates its own storm cloud if necessary, so you can cast [draw the lightning](compendium/spells/draw-the-lightning-som.md) anywhere, even underground.

If draw the lightning is cast outside under a cloudy or stormy sky, increase the bolt's damage by `2d12`.

**Heightened (8th)** The damage dealt to the initial target increases by `4d12`, and the additional damage dealt on the first [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) each turn increases by `1d12`.
