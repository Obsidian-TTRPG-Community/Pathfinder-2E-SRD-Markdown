# Freedom Of Movement *Spell 4*   
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")

You repel effects that would hinder a creature or slow its movement. While under this spell's effect, the target ignores effects that would give them a circumstance penalty to Speed. When they attempt to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) an effect that has them [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained), they automatically succeed unless the effect is magical and of a higher level than the [freedom of movement](compendium/spells/freedom-of-movement.md) spell.
