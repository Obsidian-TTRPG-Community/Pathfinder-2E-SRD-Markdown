You lance the target with energy. You deal `1d6` positive damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier. The target must attempt a basic Fortitude save. If the creature critically fails the save, it is also [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 round.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
