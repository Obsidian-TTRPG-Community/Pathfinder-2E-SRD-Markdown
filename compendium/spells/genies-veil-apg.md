# Genie's Veil *Focus 1*   
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**A creature within range is attacked.
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 willing creature

With a flourish, you fulfill a creature's wish for protection, bending reality to keep them from harm. The target vanishes in a burst of brightly colored smoke and sparkles, reappearing an instant later. They become [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) against the triggering attack and until the end of the current creature's turn.
