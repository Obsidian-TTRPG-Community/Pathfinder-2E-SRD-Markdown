You surround yourself in holy light that restores the living and rebuffs undead. You glow with bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light to the next 30 feet. Living creatures that begin their turn adjacent to you recover `2d4` Hit Points. Undead creatures that begin their turn adjacent to you take `4d4` positive damage.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The healing increases by `1d4`, and the damage to undead increases by `2d4`.
