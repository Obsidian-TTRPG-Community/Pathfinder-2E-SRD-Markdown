You probe the target's mind to glean knowledge. This deals `1d8` mental damage with a basic Will save. If the target fails the save, you sort through the stolen memories to attempt a single check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md). Choose a skill that has the [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) action, and use the target's skill modifier for the check.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The mental damage increases by `1d8`.
