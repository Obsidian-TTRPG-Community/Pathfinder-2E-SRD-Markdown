# Foresee the Path *Cantrip 5*   
[cantrip](rules/traits/cantrip.md "Cantrip Spell Trait")  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [psychic](rules/traits/psychic-da.md "Psychic Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: 60 foot
- **Targets**: 1 ally and 1 enemy
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

You see just a split second into the future and glean how an enemy will move, making it easier for your allies to strike it mid-action. Make a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check against the target enemy's Will DC or [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) DC, whichever is higher. The GM may judge a different DC is more appropriate if it's higher; for instance, using the [Warfare Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) DC of a military captain. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target ally gains a reaction that lets it make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the target enemy, triggered if the enemy leaves a square within the ally's reach. If the ally already has an ability that lets it make melee [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) as a reaction, such as [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md), the ally can forgo gaining the temporary reaction to instead gain a +2 status bonus to melee [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) it makes as reactions.
> - **Success** As critical success, but the status bonus an ally gets if it forgoes the reaction is +1.
> - **Failure** The spell has no effect.

## Amp

The spell has the same result on a failure as on a success (but still no effect on a critical failure). Each time you [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), you can choose an additional ally to target, granting them the same benefit as the initial target ally.
