As you challenge an enemy, you take some of its attention away from your allies. The target takes a –1 status penalty to attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks against creatures other than you, and you take a –1 status penalty to attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks against creatures other than the target. Each time a creature other than you uses a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action that affects the challenged enemy, the enemy can attempt a Will save. On a success, the enemy no longer takes the penalty against that creature. You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell, and it ends automatically if you or the target is defeated.
