You encircle yourself in an aura of protective flames.

Each creature that hits you with an unarmed attack, Grapples you, or otherwise touches you takes 3 fire damage. When you [Cast the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) and the first time you sustain it each round, each creature in the area takes `3d6` fire damage (basic Reflex save).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage caused by touching you increases by 1, and the fire damage when you [Cast the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) or sustain it increases by `1d6`.
