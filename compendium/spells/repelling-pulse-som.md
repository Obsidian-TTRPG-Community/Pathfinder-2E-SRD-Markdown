# Repelling Pulse *Spell 5*   
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [force](rules/traits/force.md "Force Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**30-foot emanation
- **Saving Throw** Reflex

You unleash a powerful pulse of telekinetic power, and the pulse violently hurls creatures away from you. Each creature in the area takes `7d10` force damage depending on its Reflex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage. The creature is pushed 20 feet away from you and is then knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).

**Heightened (+ 2)** The force damage increases by `2d10`, and the distance the target is moved on a failure and critical failure increases by 5 feet.
