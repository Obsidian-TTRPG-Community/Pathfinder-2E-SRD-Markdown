You afflict the target with a curse that causes it to emit ridiculous noises as it moves. Furthermore, the target's hands and feet become awkward and uncoordinated, as though it were wearing oversized gloves and shoes.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** For 1 round, the target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting an [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics), [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth), or [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check. If the target rolls a failure at an [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics), [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth), or [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check, it gets a critical failure instead.
> - **Failure** As success, but the effect is 1 hour.
> - **Critical Failure** As success, except the effect is permanent.
