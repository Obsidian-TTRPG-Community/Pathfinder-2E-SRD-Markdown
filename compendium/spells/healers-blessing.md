# Healer's Blessing *Focus 1*   
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Domains** [healing](compendium/setting/domains.md#Healing)
- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 willing living creature
- **Duration**: 1 minute

Your words bless a creature with an enhanced connection to positive energy. When the target regains Hit Points from a healing spell, it regains 2 additional Hit Point.

The target regains additional Hit Points from healer's blessing only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The additional healing increases by 2 HP.
