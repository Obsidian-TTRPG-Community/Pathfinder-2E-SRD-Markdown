# Sun Blade *Focus 2*   
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait")  [positive](rules/traits/positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 60 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature

You fire a ray of burning sunlight from your weapon. You must be wielding a sword or spear to cast [sun blade](compendium/spells/sun-blade-locg.md), and you perform this spell's somatic component with the weapon. Make a spell attack roll. The ray deals `1d4` fire damage. If the target is evil, the ray deals an additional `1d4` good damage, and if the target is undead, the ray deals an additional `1d4` positive damage (both effects apply against creatures that are both evil and undead). If you are in an area of bright natural sunlight, increase the die size of each damage die by one step (from d4 to d6).

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The ray deals double damage.
> - **Success** The ray deals full damage.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d4` fire, `1d4` good, and `1d4` positive (or `1d6` of each type of damage in bright natural sunlight).
