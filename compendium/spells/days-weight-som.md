# Day's Weight *Spell 3*   
[transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**1 living creature
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude
- **Duration**1 minute

You fast-forward time for a single creature, burdening it with the aches and pain of an entire day and making it temporarily tired and weak. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save.

> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) and [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The target is [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) and [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for the duration.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) and [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for the duration. The [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) condition doesn't end when the spell's duration does (but can still be removed with a night's rest or by similar means).

**Heightened (6th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
