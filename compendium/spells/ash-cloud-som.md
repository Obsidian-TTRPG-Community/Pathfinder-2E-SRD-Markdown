You summon a tumultuous cloud of ash and smoke. The cloud is difficult terrain for flying creatures, and creatures in the cloud can't detect anything using their sense of smell. Creatures that start their turn within the cloud take `2d4` fire damage as their lungs fill with the hot, acrid smoke, with a Fortitude save.
