# Claim Undead *Focus 6*   
[cursebound](rules/traits/cursebound-apg.md "Cursebound Spell Trait")  [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md "Oracle Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Mystery** Oracle
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 undead creature
- **Saving Throw**: Will
- **Duration**: 10 minutes

You attempt to wrest control of a target undead or force it to recognize you as its master. If the target is [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by another creature, that controller attempts a Will saving throw to retain control; otherwise, the target must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) as it fights off your commands.
> - **Failure** The target becomes [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by you and follows your orders. It (or the creature previously controlling it) can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and the spell ends on a success. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target (or the creature previously controlling it) receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature.
