- **Area**15-foot emanation

You become intensely entrancing, and creatures are distracted by you as long as they remain within the area. You can exclude any creatures you choose from the effects.

When a creature enters the area for the first time, it must attempt a Will saving throw. If a creature leaves and reenters, it uses the results of its original save.

> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) with you, and its attitude toward you improves by one step.
