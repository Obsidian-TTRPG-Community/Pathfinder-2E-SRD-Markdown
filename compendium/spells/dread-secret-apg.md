# Dread Secret *Focus 6*   
[cursebound](rules/traits/cursebound-apg.md "Cursebound Spell Trait")  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md "Oracle Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Mystery** Oracle
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 60 foot
- **Targets**: up to 6 creatures
- **Saving Throw**: Will
- **Duration**: until the start of your next turn

You utter a powerful secret at odds with the fundamental nature of the target creatures. Choose a specific resistance or weakness that you believe one or more of the targets have due to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) or previous experience with the targets, such as resistance to fire or weakness to silver. If the information is incorrect for a given target, the spell has no effect on that target. Affected targets must attempt a Will saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes 1 damage of the type of weakness you chose (thus triggering the creature's weakness), or loses its resistance until the end of your next turn if you chose a resistance.
> - **Failure** As success, and the creature becomes [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) from the revelation of its dread secret.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, except the creature is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
