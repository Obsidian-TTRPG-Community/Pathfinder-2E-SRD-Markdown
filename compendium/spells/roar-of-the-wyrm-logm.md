# Roar Of The Wyrm *Focus 4*   
[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md)  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md)  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Domains**: [wyrmkin](compendium/setting/domains.md#Wyrmkin)
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**30-foot emanation
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**varies

You channel the might of dragons into your voice, letting out a roar that engenders respect in dragonkind but that instills fear in most other creatures. The impressive roar grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks for 10 minutes against dragons that were in the area at the time of casting.

All enemies within the area other than dragons must attempt a Will save; to these enemies, roar of the wyrm is a [fear](rules/traits/fear.md) effect.

Roar of the wyrm affects non-dragon creatures with deep ties to dragonkind (such as a barbarian with the draconic instinct, a sorcerer with the draconic bloodline, or a member of a culture that reveres dragons) as if they had the [dragon](rules/traits/dragon.md) trait. The GM decides if a creature is aligned enough with dragonkind to be affected in this way. Champions, clerics, and other faithful employ a variety of holy (and unholy) instruments to demonstrate the majesty of their deity and triumphantly vanquish the foes of their faith.
