- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**15-foot cone
- **Saving Throw**  basic Will

You telepathically assail the minds of your foes. You deal mental damage equal to `2d4` plus your spellcasting ability modifier to all enemies in the area, with a basic Will save.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d4`.

## Amp

You increase the area of the spell to your choice of a 30-foot cone or 60-foot cone, and the damage dice for the spell change to d10s. Creatures that fail are [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) until the start of your next turn (or [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) on a critical failure).
