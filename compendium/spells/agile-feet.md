The blessings of your god make your feet faster and your movements more fluid. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed and ignore difficult terrain. As part of casting agile feet, you can [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) or [Step](rules/actions/step.md); you can instead [Burrow](rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md), [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) if you have the appropriate Speed.
