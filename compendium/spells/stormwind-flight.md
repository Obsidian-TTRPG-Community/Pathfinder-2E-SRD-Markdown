# Stormwind Flight *Focus 4*   
[air](rules/traits/air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait")  [druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- 
- **Duration**: 1 minute

Powerful winds carry you smoothly through the air, giving you a fly Speed equal to your Speed. When this spell's duration would end, if you're still flying, you float to the ground, as feather fall.

**Heightened (6th)** When you fly using stormwind flight, you don't count flying against the wind as difficult terrain.
