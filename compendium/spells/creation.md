# Creation *Spell 4*   
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** 1 minute 
- **Range**0 feet
- **Duration**1 hour

You conjure a temporary object from eldritch energy. It must be of vegetable matter (such as wood or paper) and 5 cubic feet or smaller. It can't rely on intricate artistry or complex moving parts, never fulfills a cost or the like, and can't be made of precious materials or materials with a rarity of uncommon or higher. It is obviously temporarily conjured, and thus can't be sold or passed off as a genuine item.

**Heightened (5th)** The item is metal and can include common minerals, like feldspar or quartz.
