# Isolation *Focus 4*   
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Domains** [darkness (apocryphal)](compendium/setting/domains.md#Darkness)
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Saving Throw**: Will
- **Duration**: 3 rounds

You summon a tangible manifestation of loneliness to cloak the target from view as surely as if it were wreathed in darkness. The target attempts a Will saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target becomes [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), but only to its allies. Any creature not allied with the target can see it normally. Effects such as [see invisibility](compendium/spells/see-invisibility.md) enable an ally to see the target. The target's allies still know the target is present and can still see all the effects of the target's actions.
> - **Failure** As success, except the target also becomes inaudible to its allies and imperceptible to them through any other senses.
