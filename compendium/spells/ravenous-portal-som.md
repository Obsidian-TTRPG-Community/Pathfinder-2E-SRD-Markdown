# Ravenous Portal *Spell 4*   
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 door no more than 10 feet tall and 5 feet wide
- **Duration**1 hour

You place a ward upon the door that triggers when a creature attempts to open, unlock, or destroy the door.

When that happens, the door transforms into a mimic that can't move and is [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) to all creatures. When [Casting the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), you designate yourself and up to 10 other creatures of your choice; these creatures don't trigger the ward, and the mimic is [helpful](rules/conditions.md#Helpful) to them instead of [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile). No effect can move the mimic unless it's also capable of moving the entire door. Once the door transforms into a mimic, it attacks creatures in its reach for up to 1 minute, and then the spell ends. If the mimic is killed before that time, the spell ends and the door returns to its normal form.

While turned into a mimic, the door can't be opened, unlocked, or bypassedâ€”not even by the designated creatures. It's a creature, not a door, during that time. When the spell ends, the door returns to the state it was in before the ward was triggered.
