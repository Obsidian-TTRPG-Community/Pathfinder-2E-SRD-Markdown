You sing a fierce prayer, low and growling, and awaken the ancient spirit of a Terwa beast to guide and strengthen the target's unarmed blows. The target's claw attack gains the versatile (piercing) trait, and deals `1d6` slashing damage. If the target's claw attack already deals `1d6` slashing damage, it deals `1d8` instead. If its claw attack already had the versatile (piercing) trait, it gains the deadly `1d8` trait.

**Heightened (4th)** The spell can affect up to 6 willing creatures with unarmed claw [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md).
