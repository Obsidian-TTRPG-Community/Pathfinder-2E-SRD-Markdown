You call upon the power of the planes to transform into a Medium elemental battle form. When you cast this spell, choose air, earth, fire, or water. While in this form, you gain the corresponding trait and the [elemental](rules/traits/elemental.md "Elemental Creature Type Trait") trait. You have hands in this battle form and can take manipulate actions.

You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

- AC = 19 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 10 temporary Hit Points.
- [Darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md).
- One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +18, and your damage bonus is +9. These are Dexterity based ([air](rules/traits/air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait") or [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")) or Strength based ([earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait") or [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait")). If your corresponding unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- **Acrobatics** ([air](rules/traits/air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait") or [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")) or [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) (earth or water) modifier of +20; ignore this change if your own modifier is higher. You also gain specific abilities based on the type of elemental you choose:

- **Water** Speed 20 feet, swim Speed 60 feet; fire resistance 5; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") wave, **Damage** `1d12` bludgeoning, and you can spend an action immediately after a hit to push the target 5 feet with the effects of a successful [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md).
