Your magic dredges up a corpse or skeleton and fills it with necromantic life, and you force the dead to fight at your command. You summon a common creature that has the [undead](rules/traits/undead.md "Undead Creature Type Trait") trait and whose level is â€“1; this creature gains the [summoned](rules/traits/summoned.md "Summoned Creature Trait") trait.
