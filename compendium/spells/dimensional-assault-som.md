# Dimensional Assault *Focus 1*   
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md "Magus Class Trait")  [teleportation](rules/traits/teleportation.md "Teleportation Effect Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: half your Speed

You tumble through space, making a short dimensional hop to better position yourself for an attack. Teleport to any square in range that's within reach of a creature, and then make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against one creature within your reach.
