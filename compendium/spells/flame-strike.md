# Flame Strike *Spell 5*   
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Area**: 10-foot radius, 40-foot-tall cylinder
- **Saving Throw**:  basic Reflex

You call a rain of divine fire that plummets down from above, dealing `8d6` fire damage. Because the flame is infused with divine energy, creatures in the area apply only half their usual fire resistance. Creatures that are immune to fire, instead of gaining the usual benefit of immunity, treat the results of their saving throws as one degree of success better.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d6`.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
