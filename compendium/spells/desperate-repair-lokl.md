# Desperate Repair *Spell 5*   
[transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**A shield within range would be reduced to 0 Hit Points by a damaging effect
- **Requirements**The triggering shield had more than 1 Hit Point before taking damage.
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**1 shield

You hold a shield together with the power of your magic, forcing wood and steel to fuse back together. The shield remains at 1 Hit Point and isn't destroyed. Its construction is weakened until someone takes the time to repair it, preventing desperate repair or a similar ability from saving the same shield until your next daily preparations.
