# Soothing Blossoms *Spell 3*   
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [plant](rules/traits/plant.md "Plant Creature Type Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Area**: 10-foot burst
- **Duration**: 10 minutes

Blossoms grow from the ground in a small area, soothing away afflictions and persistent pains and harm. When any creature in that area rolls a successful save against a [poison](rules/traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait") or [disease](rules/traits/disease.md "Disease Effect Trait") effect, it gets a critical success instead.

The blossoms grant assisted recovery to everyone in the area to end their [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), both when the spell is cast and at the start of each of your turns.

Once the duration ends, the flowers lose their [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") effect, but a few of them might survive in the area as long as they can naturally. This spell doesn't give a benefit on a save against an affliction unless the stage lasts 10 minutes or less.
