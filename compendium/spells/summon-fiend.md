# Summon Fiend *Spell 5*   
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](rules/traits/divine.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You conjure a fiend to fight on your behalf. This works like [summon animal](compendium/spells/summon-animal.md), except you summon a common creature that has the [fiend](rules/traits/fiend.md) trait and whose level is 5 or lower. You can't summon a creature unless its alignment is one of your deity's preferred alignments (or, if you don't have a deity, is within one step of your alignment). At the GM's discretion, some deities might restrict specific types of fiends, even if their alignments match.

**Heightened (7th)** Level 9.

**Heightened (8th)** Level 11.

**Heightened (9th)** Level 13.

**Heightened (10th)** Level 15.
