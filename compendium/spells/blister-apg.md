# Blister *Spell 5*   
[necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 60 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Saving Throw**: Fortitude
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You point at a target in range, and its skin grows searing blisters filled with caustic fluid. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target grows one blister. You can spend a single action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait, to pop a blister. The target and each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from the target takes `7d6` acid damage (basic Fortitude save). You choose the direction of the cone, which can't include the target. When no blisters are left, the spell ends.
> - **Failure** As success, but the target grows two blisters.
> - **Critical Failure** As success, but the target grows four blisters.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage of a popped blister increases by `1d6`.
