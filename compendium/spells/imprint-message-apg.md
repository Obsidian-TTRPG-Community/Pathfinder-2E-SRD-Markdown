# Imprint Message *Spell 1*   
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 object

You project psychic vibrations onto the target object, imprinting it with a short message or emotional theme of your design. This imprinted sensation is revealed to a creature who casts [object reading](compendium/spells/object-reading-apg.md) on the target object, replacing any emotional events the item was present for. If the object is in the area of a [retrocognition](compendium/spells/retrocognition.md) spell, the imprinted messages appear as major events in the timeline, but they don't interfere with any other visions.

If the object is targeted with [read aura](compendium/spells/read-aura.md) of a higher spell level than _imprint message_, the caster learns that the object has been magically modified. When you [Cast this Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), any prior vibrations placed on an object by previous castings of _imprint message_ fade.
