- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")

- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 creature or object
- **Duration**: unlimited (see below)

You harmlessly place your unique magical sigil, which is about 1 square inch in size, on the targeted creature or object. The mark can be visible or [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), and you can change it from one state to another by using an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to touch the target. The mark can be scrubbed or scraped off with 5 minutes of work. If it's on a creature, it fades naturally over the course of a week. The time before the mark fades increases depending on your heightened level.

**Heightened (3rd)** The sigil instead fades after 1 month.

**Heightened (5th)** The sigil instead fades after 1 year.

**Heightened (7th)** The sigil never fades.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
