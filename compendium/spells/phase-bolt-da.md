You point your finger and project a bolt of magical energy that stutters in and out of phase until it reaches the target. Make a ranged spell attack roll against your target's AC; if the target has any circumstance bonuses to AC (such as from a shield or cover), reduce that bonus by 2 for this attack. On a success, you deal `1d4` piercing damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On a critical success, the target takes double damage.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The bolt's damage increases by `1d4`.
