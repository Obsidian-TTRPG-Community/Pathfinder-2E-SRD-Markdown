# Battlefield Persistence *Focus 3*   
[cursebound](rules/traits/cursebound-apg.md)  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md)  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md)  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Mystery** Oracle
- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**You are about to attempt a saving throw, but you haven't rolled yet.

You're difficult to remove from battle. You gain a +2 status bonus to the triggering save, and if the triggering save is against an [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md) effect, it treats you as if you were 2 levels higher.
