# Liberating Command *Spell 1*   
[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions** [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: 60 foot

You call out a liberating cry, urging an ally to break free of an effect that holds them in place. If the target is [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained), it can immediately use a reaction to attempt to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md).
