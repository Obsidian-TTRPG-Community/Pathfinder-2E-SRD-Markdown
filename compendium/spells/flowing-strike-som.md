A wave of flowing water rushes behind you like an elegant river, pushing you across the battlefield with fluid grace.

You [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) up to 50 feet. This movement doesn't trigger reactions. You can make a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) at any point during your [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md). If your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) hits, the wave flows after you to batter the target of your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) as well, dealing `2d10` bludgeoning damage and pushing it 10 feet in a direction of your choice.
