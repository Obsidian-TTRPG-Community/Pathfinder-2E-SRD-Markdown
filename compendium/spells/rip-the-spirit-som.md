[death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") to [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 living creature
- **Saving Throw**:  basic Fortitude

You supernaturally rip the spirit from a living creature's body, dooming the target to pain and death. The target takes `5d6` negative damage, depending on its basic Fortitude save, and is [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) if it fails its save. The spell's effect is based on how many actions you spend when [Casting the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md).

**[>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") (somatic)** The spell targets one living creature in range.

**[>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") (somatic, verbal)** The spell targets one living creature in range and the damage is `10d6` negative instead of `5d6`.

**[>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") (material, somatic, verbal)** The spell targets all living creatures in a 30-foot emanation.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The amount of damage increases by `1d6`, or by `2d6` for the 2-action version.
