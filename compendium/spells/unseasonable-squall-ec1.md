You issue a blast of sudden wind that ripples outward from the center of the burst. The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, scatters objects of light Bulk or less, and pushes unsecured objects of 1 Bulk or less 5 feet away from the spell's origin point. Each Medium or smaller creature in the area when you [Cast the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) or that moves into spell's area must attempt a Fortitude saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature is knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone). If the creature was Flying, it gets a critical failure instead.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 30 feet away from the center of the burst, is knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone), and takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage.
