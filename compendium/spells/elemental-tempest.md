# Elemental Tempest *Focus 4*   
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md "Wizard Class Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 

Your spellcasting surrounds you in a storm of elemental energy.

If the next action you take is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) from your wizard spell slots that's an evocation spell dealing acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, a 10-foot emanation of energy surrounds you as you cast the spell. Foes in the area take `1d6` damage per spell level of the spell you just cast of the same damage type the spell deals (choose one if it deals multiple types). Combine the damage from both elemental tempest and the other spell against foes who take damage from both before applying bonuses, penalties, resistance, weakness, and the like.
