# Shifting Sand *Spell 3*   
[earth](rules/traits/earth.md)  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Area**a horizontal earthen or sandy surface within a 20-foot burst
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You cause the surface to heave. The area becomes difficult terrain and any tracks in the area are destroyed by the churning ground. Creatures standing in the area take a –1 status penalty to [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) checks to [Balance](rules/actions/balance.md) and [Tumble Through](rules/actions/tumble-through.md) and [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to [High Jump](rules/actions/high-jump.md) and [Long Jump](rules/actions/long-jump.md). The first time each round you [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), you can move the churning area up to 10 feet in any direction. Creatures [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) by the spell are carried along with the shifting sand in the same direction, if possible; this movement is forced movement. Creatures that enter or begin their turn standing in the shifting sand must attempt a Reflex save.
