You conjure an arrow of acid that continues corroding the target after it hits. Make a spell attack against the target.

On a hit, you deal `3d8` acid damage plus `1d6` [persistent acid damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). On a critical hit, double the initial damage, but not the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 2)** The initial damage increases by 2d8, and the [persistent acid damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by 1d6.
