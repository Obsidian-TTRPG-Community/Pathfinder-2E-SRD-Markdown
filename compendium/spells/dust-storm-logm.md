You call forth a swirling storm of dust. The dust storm obscures vision, with the effect of obscuring mist. The dust also makes the air unbreathable; creatures in the area must hold their breath (Core Rulebook 478), though wearing a scarf or similar clothing over the mouth increases the time the creature can hold its breath to 5 rounds. Creatures entering or starting their turn in the dust storm take `1d6` slashing damage. Creatures that have the [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") trait or that are made primarily of liquid take double damage.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
