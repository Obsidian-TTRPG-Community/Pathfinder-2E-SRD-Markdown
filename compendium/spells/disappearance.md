# Disappearance *Spell 8*   
[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Duration**: 10 minutes

You shroud a creature from others' senses. The target becomes [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected), not just to sight but to all senses, allowing the target to count as [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) no matter what precise and imprecise senses an observer might have. It's still possible for a creature to find the target by Seeking, looking for disturbed dust, hearing gaps in the sound spectrum, or finding some other way to discover the presence of an otherwise-undetectable creature.
