# Dinosaur Form *Spell 4*   
[polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- 
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You channel the primal forces of nature to transform into a Large animal battle form, specifically that of a powerful and terrifying dinosaur. You must have space to expand or the spell is lost.

When you cast this spell, choose ankylosaurus, brontosaurus, deinonychus, stegosaurus, triceratops, or tyrannosaurus. You can decide the specific type of animal, but this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the [animal](rules/traits/animal.md "Animal Creature Type Trait") and [dinosaur](rules/traits/dinosaur.md "Dinosaur Creature Trait") traits. You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

- AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 15 temporary Hit Points.
- [Low-light vision](rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md) and imprecise [scent](rules/abilities/scent.md) 30 feet.
- One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +16, and your damage bonus is +9. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) modifier of +18, unless your own modifier is higher. You also gain specific abilities based on the form you choose:
- **Ankylosaurus** Speed 25 feet; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") tail ([backswing](rules/traits/backswing.md "Backswing Weapon Trait"), [reach <10 feet>](rules/traits/reach-10-feet.md "Reach Weapon Trait")), **Damage** `2d6` bludgeoning; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") foot, **Damage** `2d6` bludgeoning.
