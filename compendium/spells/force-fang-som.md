# Force Fang *Focus 1*   
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [force](rules/traits/force.md "Force Energy & Element Trait")  [magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md "Magus Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: varies
- **Targets**: 1 creature

You briefly turn your attack into pure force to bypass your opponent's defenses. Choose a target within your reach, or within the reach of a melee weapon you're wielding.

If you can use [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) with a ranged weapon (with the starlit span hybrid study, for example), you can target a creature in the first range increment of your ranged weapon. For an instant, you transform your weapon or unarmed attack into a spike of pure force, replacing all its normal statistics and abilities. The force fang automatically deals `1d4+1` force damage to the target.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `1d4+1`.
