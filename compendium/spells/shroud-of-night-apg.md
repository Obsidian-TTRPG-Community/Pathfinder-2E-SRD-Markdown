# Shroud Of Night *Cantrip 1*   
[cantrip](rules/traits/cantrip.md "Cantrip Spell Trait")  [darkness](rules/traits/darkness.md "Darkness Effect Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [hex](rules/traits/hex-apg.md "Hex Combat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  [witch](rules/traits/witch-apg.md "Witch Class Trait")  

- **Patron** Witch
- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Saving Throw**: Will
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

Drawing your hand in a sweeping gesture, you shroud the target in a veil of night. The target's eyes are blanketed in darkness. If you cast this hex on a willing ally (for instance, one with light blindness), the ally can choose which result it gets without rolling. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The target is shrouded in murky darkness. Unless the target has [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md), other creatures are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to it.
