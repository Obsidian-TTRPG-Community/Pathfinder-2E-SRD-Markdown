- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

Devil horns grow from your skull, and your skin takes on features of the devil responsible for your diabolic bloodline.

You gain resistance 5 to evil, fire, and poison, and resistance 1 to physical damage (except silver). You can take good damage, even if you aren't evil, and you gain weakness 5 to good damage.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The resistance to evil, fire, and poison increases by 5, the resistance to physical damage (except silver) by 2, and the weakness to good damage by 5.
