# Mask Of Terror *Spell 7*   
[emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait")  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Duration**1 minute

The target appears to be a gruesome and terrifying creature.

The effect is unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target might see a demon with bloody fangs, but a demon observing the target might see a glowing angelic visage.

When any creature attempts a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action against the target, the creature must attempt a Will save. It is then temporarily immune until the end of its next turn.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature becomes [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) before using its action.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature becomes [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened), and its action fails and is wasted.

**Heightened (8th)** You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature uses a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action or reaction that affects multiple targets simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save against mask of terror.
