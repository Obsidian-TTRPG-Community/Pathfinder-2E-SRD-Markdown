# Pillar Of Water *Spell 3*   
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You create a large, self-contained cylinder of still fresh water.

The pillar has a maximum radius of 15 feet and a maximum height of 60 feet. Creatures inside the pillar can swim through the water as normal ([Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) DC 10), or, if the spell was cast on solid ground, walk along the bottom (which is difficult terrain)

Any creature that exits the pillar falls or lands accordingly.
