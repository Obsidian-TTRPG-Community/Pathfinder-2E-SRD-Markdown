You call forth a divine cataclysm from your deity, destroying living and undead creatures in the area alike. Creatures in the area take `10d6` negative damage and `10d6` alignment damage (good, evil, lawful, or chaotic), chosen from among the alignments your deity has. If your deity is true neutral, increase the negative damage by `4d6` instead of dealing alignment damage. A creature harmed by positive damage, such as one with negative healing, takes positive damage instead of negative damage from this spell.

You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity. This spell gains the trait corresponding to the alignment damage dealt.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d6` negative damage, `1d6` alignment damage, and `1d6` additional negative and positive damage for a true neutral deity.
