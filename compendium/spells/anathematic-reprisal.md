# Anathematic Reprisal *Spell 4*   
[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](rules/traits/divine.md)
- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**A creature performs an act anathema to your deity.
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**the triggering creature
- **Saving Throw** Will

You punish a creature that transgresses against your deity, drawing upon the anguish you feel upon seeing one of your deity's anathema committed.

You can cast this spell only when a creature actively commits a unique act of anathema. For example, if creating undead were anathema to your deity, you could use anathematic reprisal on a necromancer who had just created undead in front of you, but not on an undead creature just for existing.

You deal `4d6` mental damage to the target, but a basic Will save can reduce this damage. If it fails, it is also [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 round. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by 1d6.
