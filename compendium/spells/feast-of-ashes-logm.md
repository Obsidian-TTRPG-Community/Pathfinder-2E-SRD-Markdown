> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 1 hour.
> - **Success** The creature is [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The creature is immediately afflicted by hunger as if it hadn't eaten food in days. It becomes [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) and takes `1d4` damage each day that can't be healed until it sates its hunger. No amount of eating can sate the creature's hunger during the spell's duration. After the spell's duration, the creature takes damage from starvation as described on page 500 of the Core Rulebook.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure but the creature takes `2d4` damage each day, twice as much as usual for hunger.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The hunger becomes more unbearable, increasing the damage each day by `1d4`, or by `2d4` on a critical failure.
