# Infectious Melody *Spell 4*   
[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions** [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**: 15-foot emanation
- **Targets**: enemies in the area
- **Saving Throw**: Will
- **Duration**: varies

You call forth the chords of a tune so catchy that foes hearing it can't help but sing along, making it harder for them to communicate. Each target must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** For 1 round, the creature can communicate only by singing along to the melody. It can speak only on its turn, and it must take the [Perform](rules/actions/perform.md) action when it does. The result of the [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check determines how well it sang, but it stills communicate the information regardless of the result, which has no further mechanical impact than the time spent to take the action. A single [Perform](rules/actions/perform.md) check is sufficient for any amount of speaking on the creature's turn. This effect might interfere with verbal components of spells or other linguistic abilities that rely on precise speech; in order to use such an ability successfully, the creature must succeed at a DC 5 flat check. In addition, the creature takes a â€“2 status penalty on linguistic [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) checks, as singing its threats saps away some of the menace. The creature's constant humming of the tune also makes it nearly impossible for the creature to remain [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected).
> - **Failure** As success, but the duration is 3 rounds.
> - **Critical Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 hour.
