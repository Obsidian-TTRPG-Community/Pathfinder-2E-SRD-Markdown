# Chromatic Wall *Spell 5*   
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Duration**10 minutes

You create an opaque wall of light in a single vibrant color.

The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet long and 30 feet high. If the wall would pass through a creature, the spell is lost. The wall sheds bright light for 20 feet on each side, and dim light for the next 20 feet. You can ignore the wall's effects.

Roll `1d4` to determine the color of the wall. Each color has a particular effect on items, effects, or creatures that attempt to pass through. Chromatic wall can't be counteracted normally; rather, each color is automatically counteracted when targeted by a specific spell, even if that spell's level is lower than that of chromatic wall.

- **Red** The wall destroys ranged weapon ammunition (such as arrows and crossbow bolts) that would pass through, and it deals 20 fire damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. [Cone of cold](compendium/spells/cone-of-cold.md) can counteract a red chromatic wall.
- **Orange** The wall destroys thrown weapons that would pass through, and it deals 25 acid damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. [Gust of wind](compendium/spells/gust-of-wind.md) can counteract an orange chromatic wall.
- **Yellow** The wall stops [acid](rules/traits/acid.md "Acid Energy & Element Trait"), [cold](rules/traits/cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait"), [electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait"), [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait"), [force](rules/traits/force.md "Force Energy & Element Trait"), [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait"), [positive](rules/traits/positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait"), and [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait") effects from passing through, and it deals 30 electricity damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. [Disintegrate](compendium/spells/disintegrate.md) can counteract a yellow chromatic wall.
- **Green** The wall stops toxins, gases, and breath weapons from passing through. It deals 10 poison damage to anyone passing through and makes them [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 minute. A basic Fortitude save reduces the damage and negates the [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition on a success. [Passwall](compendium/spells/passwall.md) can counteract a green chromatic wall.

**Heightened (7th)** The spell's duration increases to 1 hour. Roll `1d8` to determine the wall's color; the results for 5–8 are below. A red, orange, yellow, or green wall deals an extra 10 damage.

- 5. **Blue** The wall stops [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait"), petrification, [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait"), and [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") effects from passing through, and creatures passing through are subject to the effects of [flesh to stone](compendium/spells/flesh-to-stone.md). [Magic missile](compendium/spells/magic-missile.md) can counteract a blue chromatic wall.
- 6. **Indigo** The wall stops [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait") and [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effects from passing through, and those passing through are subject to the effects of [warp mind](compendium/spells/warp-mind.md). [Searing light](compendium/spells/searing-light.md) can counteract an indigo chromatic wall.
- 7. **Violet** The wall prevents spells from targeting the other side (area effects still cross as normal). Creatures passing through must succeed at a Will save or they are [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 minute; on a critical failure, the creature is instead sent to another plane, with the effect of [plane shift](compendium/spells/plane-shift.md). [Dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) can counteract a violet chromatic wall.
- 8. Reroll, and creatures that pass through the wall take a –2 circumstance penalty to their saves.
