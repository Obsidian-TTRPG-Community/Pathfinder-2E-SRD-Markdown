# Spirit Object *Cantrip 1*   
[cantrip](rules/traits/cantrip.md "Cantrip Spell Trait")  [hex](rules/traits/hex-apg.md "Hex Combat Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [witch](rules/traits/witch-apg.md "Witch Class Trait")  

- **Patron** Witch
- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") or [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 unattended object up to 1 Bulk

Using a sliver of Baba Yaga's power, you briefly bring an object to life. The object gains a means of locomotion, such as sprouting chicken legs, and [Strides](rules/actions/stride.md) up to 25 feet to a space you decide within range. If you spent 2 actions [Casting the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), the object then attacks one creature of your choice adjacent to its new space. Make a melee spell attack roll against the creature. On a success, the creature takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (as appropriate for the object) equal to `1d4` plus your spellcasting ability modifier, and on a critical success, it takes double damage.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the maximum Bulk of the target by 1 and the damage by `1d4`.
