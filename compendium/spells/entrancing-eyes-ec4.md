> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected and becomes immune to this particular casting of the spell. Success The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** Until the end of its next turn, the target is [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) and [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated).
> - **Critical Failure** Until the end of its next turn, the target is [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied), [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated), and can't take reactions. In addition, all creatures and objects other than you are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) from the target. During any round you [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), you can use a single action, which has the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait, to focus your entrancing eyes on a single creature you can see within 30 feet. This creature must immediately make a Will save against the spell as if it were ending its turn in the emanation. If the creature was already [fascinated](rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) by your entrancing eyes before its save, a failed save causes it to be [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 round. You can't use this action to focus on the same creature more than once per round.
