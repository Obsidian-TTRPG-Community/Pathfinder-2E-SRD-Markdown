You draw forth a hag's innate jealousy to deny a target its greatest attribute. The target gains an adverse condition depending on its highest ability modifier: Strength ([enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled)); Dexterity ([clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy)); Constitution ([drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained)); or Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma ([stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied)). On a tie, the creature decides which of the conditions associated with the tied ability modifiers to take. The target must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The condition's value is 1.
> - **Critical Failure** The condition's value is 2. At the start of each of your turns, the target can attempt another Will save, ending the effect on a success.
