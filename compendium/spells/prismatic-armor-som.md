# Prismatic Armor *Spell 7*

- **Range**touch

You wrap the target in armor made of multicolored light.

It functions as [chromatic armor](compendium/spells/chromatic-armor-som.md) that is all colors (granting resistance 5 to acid, electricity, fire, force, mental, poison, and sonic). An attacker that critically fails on its saving throw against the spell is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) rather than [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled).

**Heightened (9th)** The resistances increase to 10 each.
