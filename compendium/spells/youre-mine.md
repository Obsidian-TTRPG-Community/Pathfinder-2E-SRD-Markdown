- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Saving Throw**: Will
- **Duration**: 1 round

You manipulate the target's emotions, potentially allowing you to control it for a brief instant. The target must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
> - **Failure** On the target's next turn, it's [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) and you partially control it, causing it to take a single action of your choice. If it has actions left, it can act normally.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) for 1 round.

**Heightened (7th)** On a failure, the target is [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) for 1 round. On a critical failure, the target is [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) for up to 1 minute; it receives a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and on a success, the spell ends.
