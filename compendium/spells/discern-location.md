# Discern Location *Spell 8*   
[detection](rules/traits/detection.md "Detection Effect Trait")  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** 10 minutes 
- **Range**unlimited
- **Targets**1 creature or object

You learn the name of the target's exact location (including the building, community, and country) and plane of existence.

You can target a creature only if you've seen it in person, have one of its significant belongings, or have a piece of its body. To target an object, you must have touched it or have a fragment of it. Discern location automatically overcomes protections against detection and divination of lower level than this spell, even if they would normally have a chance to block it.
