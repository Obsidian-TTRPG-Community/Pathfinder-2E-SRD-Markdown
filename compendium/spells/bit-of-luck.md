- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 willing creature
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You tilt the scales of luck slightly to protect a creature from disaster. When the target would attempt a saving throw, it can roll twice and use the better result. Once it does this, the spell ends.

If you cast [bit of luck](compendium/spells/bit-of-luck.md) again, any previous bit of luck you cast that's still in effect ends. After a creature has been targeted with bit of luck, it becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
