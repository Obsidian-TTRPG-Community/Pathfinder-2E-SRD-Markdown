- **Mystery** Oracle
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Area**: up to two 5-foot bursts that don't overlap
- **Saving Throw**:  basic Reflex

You call forth a storm of whirling flames, engulfing all creatures in that area and dealing `5d6` fire damage with a basic Reflex save.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `3d6`, and you can add another nonoverlapping 5-foot burst to the area.
