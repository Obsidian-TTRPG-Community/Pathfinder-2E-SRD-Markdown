# Veil Of Confidence *Focus 1*   
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Domains** [confidence](compendium/setting/domains.md#Confidence)
- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- 
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You surround yourself in a veil of confidence. You reduce your current [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition by 1, and whenever you would become [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) during the duration, reduce the amount by 1. If you critically fail a save against fear, veil of confidence ends immediately, and you increase any [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition you gain from the critical failure by 1 instead of decreasing it.
