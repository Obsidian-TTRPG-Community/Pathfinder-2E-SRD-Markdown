# Lose The Path *Spell 1*   
[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions** [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**: A creature in range [Strides](rules/actions/stride.md).
- **Range**: 60 foot
- **Targets**: the triggering creature
- **Saving Throw**: Will

You surround a moving creature with lifelike illusions, shifting their perception of the terrain to subtly lead them off course. The target must attempt a Will save.

Regardless of the result, the creature is immune to lose the path for 1 hour.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature treats all squares as difficult terrain for its [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md).
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, except that you determine where the target moves during the [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), though you can't move it into hazardous terrain or to a place it can't stand.
