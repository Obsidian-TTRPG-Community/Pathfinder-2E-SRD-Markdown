It explodes in an enormous burst that deals `3d6` bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area from the cascade of water. The water deals an additional `6d6` positive damage to undead and `6d6` good damage to fiends.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The bludgeoning damage increases by `1d6`, and the additional positive and good damage each increase by `2d6`.
