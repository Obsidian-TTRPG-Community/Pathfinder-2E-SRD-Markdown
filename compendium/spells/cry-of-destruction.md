Your voice booms, smashing what's in front of you. Each creature and unattended object in the area takes `1d8` sonic damage. If you already dealt damage to an enemy this turn with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or spell, increase the damage dice from this spell to d12s.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d8`.
