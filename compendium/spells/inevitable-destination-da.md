You twist the paths of the target, ensuring that each one leads to you. The target attempts a Will saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** As failure, plus the target is pulled 10 feet closer to you and falls [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone), tripping in its haste to move toward you.
> - **Success** Your pull hampers the target's footsteps. It takes a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the end of its next turn.
> - **Failure** The target can't move any farther from you than it was when you [Cast the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), though it can move in such a way that it maintains an equal distance. If you move farther away from the target than the initial distance, the spell ends. The targeted foe can attempt to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) against your spell DC. If it succeeds, the spell ends.
