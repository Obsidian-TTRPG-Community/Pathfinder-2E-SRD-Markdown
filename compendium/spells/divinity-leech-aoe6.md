> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** Each target of the divine spell has an outcome one degree of success better than the result it rolled.
> - **Failure** The divine spell is lost and target is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for 1 round.
