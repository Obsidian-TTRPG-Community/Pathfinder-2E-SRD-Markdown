# Breath Of Life *Spell 5*   
[healing](rules/traits/healing.md "Healing Effect Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [positive](rules/traits/positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**: A living creature within range would die.
- **Range**: 60 foot
- **Targets**: the triggering creature

Your blessing revives a creature at the moment of its death.

You prevent the target from [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) and restore Hit Points to the target equal to `4d8` plus your spellcasting ability modifier. You can't use breath of life if the triggering effect was [disintegrate](compendium/spells/disintegrate.md) or a [death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait") effect.
