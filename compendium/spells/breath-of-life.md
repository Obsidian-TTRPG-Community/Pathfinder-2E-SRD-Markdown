Your blessing revives a creature at the moment of its death.

You prevent the target from [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) and restore Hit Points to the target equal to `4d8` plus your spellcasting ability modifier. You can't use breath of life if the triggering effect was [disintegrate](compendium/spells/disintegrate.md) or a [death](rules/traits/death.md) effect.
