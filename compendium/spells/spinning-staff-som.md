# Spinning Staff *Focus 1*   
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md "Magus Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a staff.
- 

You spin your staff with a twirling flourish, attacking two foes and transforming the momentum into magical energy to charge for your next [Spellstrike](rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md). Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with your staff against one foe and then a second melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with your staff against a different foe. Your multiple attack penalty applies to both of these attacks as normal.
