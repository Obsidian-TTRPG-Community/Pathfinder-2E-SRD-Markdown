# Shooting Star *Focus 1*   
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md)  [magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Requirements**You're wielding a ranged weapon or a thrown weapon.

You let loose a projectile that flies true and leaves the blazing trail of a meteor behind it. Make a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), ignoring the target's concealment and reducing the target's cover by one degree for this [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) only (greater to standard, standard to lesser, and lesser to none). If the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) hits, the meteor trail hangs in the air. This gives the benefits of concealment negation and cover reduction to any attacks made against the creature (by anyone) until the start of your next turn.
