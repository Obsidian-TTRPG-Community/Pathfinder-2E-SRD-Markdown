# Plant Form *Spell 5*   
[plant](rules/traits/plant.md "Plant Creature Type Trait")  [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

Taking inspiration from verdant creatures, you transform into a Large plant battle form. You must have space to expand into or the spell is lost. When you cast this spell, choose arboreal, flytrap, or shambler. You can substitute a similar specific plant to turn into (such as a pitcher plant instead of a flytrap), but this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the [plant](rules/traits/plant.md "Plant Creature Type Trait") trait. You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

- AC = 19 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 12 temporary Hit Points.
- Resistance 10 to poison.
- Low-light vision.
- One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +17, and your damage bonus is +11. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) modifier of +19, unless your own modifier is higher. You also gain specific abilities based on the type of plant you choose:
- **Arboreal** Speed 30 feet; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") branch (reach <15 feet>), **Damage** `2d10` bludgeoning; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") foot, **Damage** `2d8` bludgeoning; you can speak in this form, but you still can't [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) or supply verbal components.
- **Flytrap** Speed 15 feet; resistance 10 to acid; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") leaf (reach <10 feet>), **Damage** `2d8` piercing, and you can spend an action after a hit to Grab the target.
- **Shambler** Speed 20 feet, swim Speed 20 feet; resistance 10 to electricity; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") vine (reach <15 feet>), **Damage** `2d8` slashing.

**Heightened (6th)** Your battle form is Huge, and the reach of your attacks increases by 5 feet. You instead gain AC = 22 + your level, 24 temporary HP, attack modifier +21, damage bonus +16, and [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) +22.
