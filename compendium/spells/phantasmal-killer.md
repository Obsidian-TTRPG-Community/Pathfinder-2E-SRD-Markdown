# Phantasmal Killer *Spell 4*   
[death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait")  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait")  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Targets**: 1 living creature
- **Saving Throw**: Will

You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the target. Only the spell's target can see the killer, though you can see the vague shape of the illusion as it races forth to attack. The effect of the killer is based on the outcome of the target's Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes `4d6` mental damage and is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Failure** The target takes `8d6` mental damage and is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Critical Failure** The target is so afraid it might die. It must attempt a Fortitude save; if the target fails, it dies. On a successful Fortitude save, the target takes `12d6` mental damage, is [fleeing](rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) until the end of its next turn, and is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened). This effect has the [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait") trait.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d6` on a failure and by `3d6` on a critical failure.
