[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Domains** [pain](compendium/setting/domains.md#Pain)
- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Saving Throw**: Will

You inflict pain upon the target and revel in their anguish. This deals `1d4` mental damage and `1d4` [persistent mental damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage); the target must attempt a Will save. As long as the target is taking [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from this spell, you gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and skill checks against the target.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes half damage and no [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Failure** The target takes full initial and [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Critical Failure** The target takes double initial and [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The initial damage increases by `1d4` and the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by `1d4`.
