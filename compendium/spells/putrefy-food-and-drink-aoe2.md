Holy water, unholy water, and similar food and drink of significance are spoiled by this spell, unless they are associated with a deity of decay or putrefaction, but it has no effect on creatures of any type, potions, or alchemical elixirs. One cubic foot of liquid is roughly 8 gallons.

**Heightened (3rd)** You can target a potion or alchemical elixir with this spell, attempting a counteract check against it. If you succeed, the elixir or potion spoils and becomes a mundane item.
