From outside, the area looks like a bank of impenetrable black fog. Sensory stimuli (such as sounds, smells, and light) don't pass from inside the area to outside the area. [Scrying](compendium/spells/scrying.md) spells can't perceive any stimuli from the area, and mind-reading effects don't work in the area.
