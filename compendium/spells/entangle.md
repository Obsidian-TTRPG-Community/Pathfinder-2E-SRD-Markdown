# Entangle *Spell 2*   
[plant](rules/traits/plant.md "Plant Creature Type Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Area**: all squares in a 20-foot burst that contain plants or fungi
- **Duration**: 1 minute

Plants or fungi in the area entangle creatures. The area counts as difficult terrain. Each round that a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, it takes a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and on a critical failure, it is also [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) for 1 round. Creatures can attempt to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) at entangle's DC to remove these effects.
