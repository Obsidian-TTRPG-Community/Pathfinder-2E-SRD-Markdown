# Haunting Hymn *Cantrip 1*   
[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [cantrip](rules/traits/cantrip.md "Cantrip Spell Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait")

- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**: 15-foot cone
- **Saving Throw**: Fortitude

You echo a jarring hymn that only creatures in the area can hear. The hymn deals sonic damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, with a basic Fortitude save. If a target critically fails the save, it's also [deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
