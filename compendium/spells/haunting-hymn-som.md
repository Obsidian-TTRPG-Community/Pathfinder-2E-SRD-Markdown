# Haunting Hymn *Cantrip 1*   
[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md)  [cantrip](rules/traits/cantrip.md)  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**15-foot cone
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude

You echo a jarring hymn that only creatures in the area can hear. The hymn deals sonic damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, with a basic Fortitude save. If a target critically fails the save, it's also [deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
