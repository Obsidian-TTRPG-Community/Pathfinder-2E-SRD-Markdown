[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)

- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**10 minutes

Falsehoods pass your lips as smoothly as silk. You gain a +4 status bonus to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks to [Lie](rules/actions/lie.md) and against [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to discern if you are telling the truth, and you add your level even if you're untrained. If the implausibility of your lies prompts a circumstance penalty or a DC increase, reduce that penalty or increase by half.
