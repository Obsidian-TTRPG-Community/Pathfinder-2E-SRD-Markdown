# Fear the Sun *Spell 2*   
[transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Saving Throw**: Fortitude

You cause the creature's vision to become particularly sensitive. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The creature is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature gains light blindness (Pathfinder Bestiary 343) for 1 minute. If the creature is already exposed to bright light, it immediately becomes [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded), as it isn't acclimated to its newly acquired light blindness.

**Heightened (6th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
