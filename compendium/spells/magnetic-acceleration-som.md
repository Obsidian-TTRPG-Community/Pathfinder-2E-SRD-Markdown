# Magnetic Acceleration *Spell 3*   
[attack](rules/traits/attack.md "Attack Combat Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature or object

You magnetize a small metal object, such as a nail or coin, and launch it away from you at massive speed. Make a ranged spell attack roll; if the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll with magnetic acceleration. On a hit, the target takes `3d6` bludgeoning damage and `3d6` piercing damage, or double damage on a critical hit.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The bludgeoning and piercing damage each increase by `1d6`.
