# Knock *Spell 2*   
[transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 door, lock, or container
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You make the target easier to open. Knock grants a +4 status bonus to any creature that tries to open the target door, lock, or container with an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) or a [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check. You can attempt a [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check to open the target as part of casting knock, and you add your level even if you're untrained.

Knock counteracts lock.
