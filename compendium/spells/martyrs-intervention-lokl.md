# Martyr's Intervention *Spell 3*   
[healing](rules/traits/healing.md)  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**A creature within range would take damage that reduces it to 0 Hit Points
- **Requirements**You don't have the [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition.
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**1 living creature

You shield a creature in dire need with your own life force, taking the harm upon yourself to save their life. The target is reduced to 1 Hit Point instead of 0 Hit Points. All remaining damage that was prevented from harming the target creature is instead dealt to you. Both you and the target become [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded); targets who are already [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) increased their [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) value by 1.
