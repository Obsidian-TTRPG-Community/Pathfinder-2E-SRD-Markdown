# Thunderous Strike *Focus 1*   
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md "Magus Class Trait")  [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a melee weapon in two hands.
- 

You swing your massive weapon, creating a wave of sonic vibrations that topples creatures. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with your two-handed weapon. Each creature in a 15-foot cone from you must attempt a basic Fortitude save against your spell DC or take 2 sonic damage. On a critical failure, the creature is knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone). The target of your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) must be within the cone or the effect fails.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by 1.
