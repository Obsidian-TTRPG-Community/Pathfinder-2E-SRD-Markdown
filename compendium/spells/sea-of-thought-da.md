# Sea of Thought *Spell 3*   
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Area**15-foot burst
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude
- **Duration**1 minute

You cover the area in a sloshing torrent of semi-solidified thought, roughly ankle high. The area becomes difficult terrain, similarly to a shallow bog. Each round that a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Fortitude save against the shifting waves of thought. On a failure, it takes a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and on a critical failure, it is also knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The radius of the spell's area increases by 5 feet.
