# Worm's Repast *Spell 2*   
[necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Traditions** [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 corporeal creature
- **Saving Throw**: Fortitude
- **Duration**: see below

Gnawing worms materialize within the flesh of the target creature, dealing `4d6` piercing damage and `1d6` [persistent piercing damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). If the target is a non-skeletal corporeal undead creature, you deal an extra `2d6` [persistent piercing damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The worms writhe away harmlessly and the target takes no damage.
> - **Success** The target takes full initial damage but no [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and the spell ends immediately.
> - **Failure** The target takes full initial and [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) due to the pain for as long as it takes [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double the initial damage and is also [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) by the pain for as long as it takes [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 2)** : The initial and [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increase by `2d6` and `1d6`, respectively.
