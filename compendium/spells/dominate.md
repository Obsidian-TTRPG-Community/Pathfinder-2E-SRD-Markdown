# Dominate *Spell 6*   
[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**until the next time you make your daily preparations

You take command of the target, forcing it to obey your orders.

If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order. The effect depends on its Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) as it fights off your commands.
> - **Failure** The target follows your orders but can attempt a Will save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.
> - **Critical Failure** As a failure, but the target receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature, such as killing its allies.

**Heightened (10th)** The duration is unlimited.
