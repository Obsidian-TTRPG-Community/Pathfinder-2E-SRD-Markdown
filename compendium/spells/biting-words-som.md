# Biting Words *Spell 1*   
[attack](rules/traits/attack.md "Attack Combat Trait")  [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait")  [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Traditions** [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- 
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You entwine magic with your voice, causing your taunts and jibes to physically harm your enemies. You can attack with your words once when you finish [Casting the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), and can repeat the attack once on each of your subsequent turns by taking a single action, which has the attack, [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait"), and [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait") traits. After your third attack total, the spell ends.

When you attack with biting words, make a ranged spell attack roll against a creature within 30 feet, dealing `2d6` sonic damage if you hit (or double damage on a critical hit).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d6`.
