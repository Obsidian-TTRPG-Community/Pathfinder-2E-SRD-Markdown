# Monstrosity Form *Spell 8*   
[polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- 
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You transform into the shape of a legendary monster, assuming a Huge battle form. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. When you cast this spell, choose phoenix, purple worm, or sea serpent. While in this form, you gain the [beast](rules/traits/beast.md "Beast Creature Type Trait") trait (for phoenix) or the [animal](rules/traits/animal.md "Animal Creature Type Trait") trait (for purple worm or sea serpent). You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

- AC = 20 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 20 temporary Hit Points.
- [Darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md).
- One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +28, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) modifier of +30, unless your own modifier is higher. You also gain specific abilities based on the type of monster you choose:
- **Phoenix** Speed 30 feet, fly Speed 90 feet; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") beak (reach <15 feet>), **Damage** `2d6+12` piercing plus `2d4` fire and `2d4` [persistent fire](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage); **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") talon (agile, reach <15 feet>), **Damage** `2d8+12` slashing; Shroud of Flame (aura, evocation, fire, primal) 20 feet. You gain an aura of fire that extends out from you. A creature that enters or ends its turn within the aura takes `2d6` fire damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. You can use a single action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait, to activate or deactivate this aura.
- **Purple Worm** Speed 40 feet, burrow Speed 30 feet, swim Speed 20 feet; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") jaws (reach <10 feet>), **Damage** `2d12+20` piercing; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") stinger (agile, reach <10 feet>), **Damage** `2d8+15` piercing plus `2d6` [persistent poison](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage); **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") body (reach <10 feet>) **Damage** `2d8+20` bludgeoning; Inexorable You automatically recover from the [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed), and [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) conditions at the end of each of your turns. You're also immune to being [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) and ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain.
- **Sea Serpent** Speed 20 feet, swim Speed 90 feet; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") jaws (reach <15 feet>), **Damage** `2d12+20` piercing; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") tail (reach <25 feet>), **Damage** `2d8+20` bludgeoning; Spine Rake [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") ([move](rules/traits/move.md "Move Combat Trait")) You extend your spines and [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) or [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md). Each creature you're adjacent to at any point during your movement takes `4d8+10` slashing damage (basic Reflex against your spell DC).
