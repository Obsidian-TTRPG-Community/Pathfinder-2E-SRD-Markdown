# Debilitating Dichotomy *Focus 4*   
[cursebound](rules/traits/cursebound-apg.md "Cursebound Spell Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md "Oracle Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature other than you
- **Saving Throw**: Will

You reveal a glimpse of the impossible conflicts between the divine anathema behind your curse, forcing you to reckon with another's conflicts as well. You and the target each take `9d6` mental damage with a basic Will save, and the target is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) if it critically fails its save. You get a degree of success one better than you rolled for your saving throw.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `3d6`.
