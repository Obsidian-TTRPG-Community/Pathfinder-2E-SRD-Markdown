- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature other than you
- **Saving Throw** Will

You reveal a glimpse of the impossible conflicts between the divine anathema behind your curse, forcing you to reckon with another's conflicts as well. You and the target each take `9d6` mental damage with a basic Will save, and the target is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) if it critically fails its save. You get a degree of success one better than you rolled for your saving throw.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `3d6`.
