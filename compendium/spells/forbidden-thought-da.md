- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Saving Throw**: Will

You place a psychic lock in a foe's mind that prevents it from a specific action. Choose "[Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)," "[Stride](rules/actions/stride.md)," "[Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)," or a specific action you know the creature to have (such as "Breath Weapon" against a dragon). If the creature attempts that action on its next turn, it must surmount your lock to do so, causing it to take `1d6` mental damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier (with a basic Will save). The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d6`.

## Amp

Your telepathic push is particularly shocking to those who resist it. If the target fails its save, it's also [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
