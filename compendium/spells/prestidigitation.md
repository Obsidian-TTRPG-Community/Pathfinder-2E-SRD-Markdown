# Prestidigitation *Cantrip 1*   
[cantrip](rules/traits/cantrip.md "Cantrip Spell Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 10 foot
- **Targets**: 1 object (cook, lift, or tidy only)
- **Duration**: sustained

The simplest magic does your bidding. You can perform simple [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") effects for as long as you [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md). Each time you [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), you can choose one of four options.

- **Cook** Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
- **Lift** Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the ground.
- **Make** Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical substance. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragileâ€”it can't be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component.
- **Tidy** Color, clean, or soil an object of light Bulk or less

You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object a 1 minute per Bulk.

Prestidigitation can't deal damage or cause adverse conditions. Any actual change to an object (beyond what is noted above) persists only as long as you [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md).

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
