# Control Sand *Spell 7*   
[earth](rules/traits/earth.md)  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**5-foot emanation
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You whip up a small sandstorm around your body. When a creature starts its turn in the area or moves into the area, it must succeed at a Fortitude save or become [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for as long as it remains in the area; it is then temporarily immune to this dazzling effect for 10 minutes.

Choose one of the following additional effects when you cast this spell. On subsequent rounds, you can switch to a different effect once per round as a free action triggered by sustaining the spell.

- **Sand Shield** You create a magical shield made of sand. The sand shield provides no benefit to AC, but it does allow you to use the Shield Block reaction (Core Rulebook 266) and acts as a shield for this purpose. The sand shield has Hardness 14, 21 Hit Points, and no [Broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) Threshold; when the shield's HP are reduced to 0, you can't use its Shield Block reaction again until the next time you [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) and choose the sand shield effect.
- **Sandblast** You direct a jet of sand at a single target. One creature of your choice within 30 feet takes `8d6` slashing damage (basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, the creature is also [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute.
- **Sandstorm** The area of the spell expands to a 30-foot emanation, and any creature that starts its turn in the area or moves into the area takes `6d4` slashing damage (basic Reflex save) and must hold its breath or begin suffocating (Core Rulebook 478).

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the sand shield's Hardness by 2 and its Hit Points by 1, the sandblast damage by `1d6`, and the sandstorm damage by `1d4`.
