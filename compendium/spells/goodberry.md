# Goodberry *Focus 1*   
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  [healing](rules/traits/healing.md "Healing Effect Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 ripe berry
- **Duration**: 10 minutes

You imbue the target berry with the bounty of nature, turning it into a goodberry that can heal and sustain far beyond its normal capacity. A creature can eat the goodberry with an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to regain `1d6+4` Hit Points. A berry not consumed during the duration withers away. Every six goodberries consumed gives as much nourishment as one square meal for a typical human.

**Heightened (+ 1)** You can target an additional berry. A creature can consume any number of goodberries from the same casting with a single [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action.
