# Fearful Feast *Focus 4*   
[fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Domains**: [abomination](compendium/setting/domains.md#Abomination)
- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**A creature within range becomes [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**the triggering creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**varies

You open your mouth wide and inhale sharply; you draw in the bravery, self-confidence, and hope to which the [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) target clings and then strip away the target's false assumption that these fragile emotions can save them from the oblivion of terror.

You deal `6d4` mental damage to the creature, which must attempt a Will saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature's [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition increases by 1, and it takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature's [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition increases by 2, and it takes full damage; you regain Hit Points equal to half the damage the target takes.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature's [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition increases by 3 and it takes double damage; you regain Hit Points equal to half the damage the target takes.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d4`.
