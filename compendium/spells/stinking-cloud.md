You create a cloud of putrid mist in the area. The cloud functions as [obscuring mist](compendium/spells/obscuring-mist.md) except it sickens creatures that end their turns within the cloud. (The [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition is not a [poison](rules/traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait") effect.)

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
> - **Failure** The creature is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) while in the cloud.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) until it leaves the cloud.
