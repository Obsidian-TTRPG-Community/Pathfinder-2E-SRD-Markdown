With a surge of healing energy, you push back against an affliction threatening the target and grant a small amount of healing. The target recovers `3d8` Hit Points. You attempt to counteract any one affliction you are aware the target has, suspending its effects for 1 hour on a success rather than removing it. The target is then temporarily immune to delay affliction for 1 day. You don't need to have identified the name of the specific affliction, but you do need to be aware of it; for instance, you couldn't delay an ingested poison during its onset period unless you were aware of the poison.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The target recovers an additional `1d8` Hit Points and you can attempt to suspend an additional affliction.
