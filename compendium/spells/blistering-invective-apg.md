- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Saving Throw**: Will

A heap of insults and invectives spew from your mouth—words so devastating your foes burn from the intensity of your diatribe. Your words deal `2d6` [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and the target must attempt a Will save. If the target doesn't understand the language or you're not speaking a language, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes half the [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Failure** The target becomes [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) and takes the full [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Critical Failure** The target becomes [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) and takes double the [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 2)** You can target two additional creatures, and the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by `2d6`.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
