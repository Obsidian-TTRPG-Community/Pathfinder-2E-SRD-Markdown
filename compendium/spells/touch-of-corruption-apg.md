# Touch Of Corruption *Focus 1*   
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 willing undead creature or 1 living creature

You infuse the target with negative energy. If the target is living, this deals `1d6` negative damage (basic Fortitude save); on a failed save, the target also takes a â€“2 status penalty to AC for 1 round.

If the target is a willing undead creature, the target instead regains 6 Hit Points, and if you are the undead target, you also gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls for 1 round.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the damage dealt to a living creature by `1d6` or increase the Hit Points regained by undead by 6.
