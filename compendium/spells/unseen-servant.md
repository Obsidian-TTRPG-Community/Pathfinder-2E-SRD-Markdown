You summon an unseen servant, which you can command as part of [Sustaining the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md). It serves you until its Hit Points are reduced to 0, at which point the spell ends, or until you stop [Sustaining the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md). The unseen servant gains the [summoned](rules/traits/summoned.md) trait.
