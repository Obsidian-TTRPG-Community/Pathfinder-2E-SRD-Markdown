# Wall Of Thorns *Spell 3*   
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [plant](rules/traits/plant.md "Plant Creature Type Trait")  

- **Traditions** [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**: 60 foot
- **Duration**: 1 minute

Over the course of a minute, you cause a thick wall of thorny brambles to grow from the ground. You create a 5-footthick wall of brambles and thorns in a straight line up to 60 feet long and 10 feet high. You must create the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. The wall stands vertically. If you wish, the wall can be of a shorter length or height. Everything on each side of the wall has cover from creatures on the opposite side, and the wall's spaces are difficult terrain. For every move action a creature uses to enter at least one of the wall's spaces, that creature takes `3d4` piercing damage.

Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 20 Hit Points. It's immune to critical hits and precision damage. A destroyed section can be moved through freely.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The Hit Points of each section of the wall increase by 5, and the piercing damage increases by `1d4`.
