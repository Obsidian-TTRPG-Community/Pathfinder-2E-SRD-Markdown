# Cloak Of Colors *Spell 5*   
[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Duration**: 1 minute

A cloak of swirling colors shrouds the target. Creatures are [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) while adjacent to it, and attacking the target causes a brilliant flash of light. A creature that hits the target with a melee attack must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The attacker is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The attacker is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round.
> - **Critical Failure** The attacker is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for 1 round. The creature is temporarily immune until the end of its turn; this effect has the [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait") trait.
