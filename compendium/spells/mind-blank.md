# Mind Blank *Spell 8*   
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Duration**until the next time you make your daily preparations

Powerful wards hide a creature from divination magic. The target gains a +4 status bonus to saves against [mental](rules/traits/mental.md) effects.

Mind blank attempts to counteract any detection, [revelation](rules/traits/revelation.md), and [scrying](rules/traits/scrying.md) effects as if its spell level were 1 higher than its actual level. On a success, the [divination](rules/traits/divination.md) effect functions normally except that it detects nothing about the target and its possessions. For instance, detect magic would still detect other magic in the area, but not any magic on the target.
