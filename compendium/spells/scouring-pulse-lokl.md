# Scouring Pulse *Spell 5*   
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait")  [positive](rules/traits/positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Area**: 10-foot radius, 60-foot-tall cylinder
- **Saving Throw**: Reflex

You inundate the area with concentrated positive energy, which scours away the stain of undeath. Each creature in the area takes `6d8` positive damage and must attempt a basic Reflex save. Creatures that fail the save also take `1d8` [persistent positive damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). Creatures that take [persistent positive damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from scouring pulse are wreathed in a heatless halo of light. They emit bright light in a 5-foot radius preventing them from being [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed); if the creature is [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), they're [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) while affected by scouring pulse, rather than being [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected).

**Heightened (8th)** The positive damage increases to `9d8` damage, and the [persistent positive damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases to `2d8`. Creatures remain suffused in light for `1d4` additional rounds after removing the [persistent positive damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
