[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [cantrip](rules/traits/cantrip.md "Cantrip Spell Trait")  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- 
- **Duration**: 10 minutes

You amplify your voice, loud enough for you to be heard easily at a great distance. For the duration, your voice can be heard loudly and clearly by all listeners within 500 feet, even if other ambient noise would otherwise block the sound. Despite the volume, this doesn't make your voice jarring or distracting. This doesn't increase the range or area of other [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") or [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait") effects, and physical barriers such as walls and doors still block or muffle your voice as normal.

Your loud voice makes it easier to [Coerce](rules/actions/coerce.md) others, and the acoustics assist in Performing at a large venue. You gain a +1 status bonus to checks to [Coerce](rules/actions/coerce.md) and auditory [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks to [Perform](rules/actions/perform.md) at a large venue.

You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell.

**Heightened (5th)** Your voice can be heard clearly up to 1,200 feet away.

**Heightened (7th)** Your voice can be heard clearly up to 1 mile away.
