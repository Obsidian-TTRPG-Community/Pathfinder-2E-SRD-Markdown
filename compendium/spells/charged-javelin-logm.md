You fire a javelin of electricity that leaves a charged field around its target. Make a spell attack roll. The javelin deals `1d6` electricity damage and 1 [persistent electricity damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

> - **Critical Success** The javelin deals double damage, both initial and persistent.
> - **Success** The javelin deals full damage. As long as the target is taking [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from this spell, creatures gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls with metal weapons or [electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait") effects against the target, and the target takes a â€“1 status penalty to saves against [electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait") effects.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The initial damage increases by `1d6`, and the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by 1.
