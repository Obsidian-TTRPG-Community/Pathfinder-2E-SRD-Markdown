# Draconic Barrage *Focus 1*   
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Domains**: [wyrmkin](compendium/setting/domains.md#Wyrmkin)
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

You shape energy into one incorporeal tiny dragon (or serpentine creature) that flits around you. The specific dragon is random; roll `1d6` on the table below for each dragon evoked to determine which type of dragon you create. While the spell persists, you can command one of your dragons to spit a missile of energy at a creature within 60 feet by using a single action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait. This is a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) that uses your spell attack bonus and deals `1d6` damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier, with the damage type depending on the dragon. A dragon's breath [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. Once a dragon has used its breath [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), it winks out of existence; when you have no dragons remaining, the spell ends.

| `D6` | Dragon | Breath Strike Type |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| 1 | Copper or black | Acid |
| 2 | Silver or white | Cold |
| 3 | Bronze or blue | Electricity |
| 4 | Brass, gold, or red | Fire |
| 5 | Green | Poison |
| 6 | Your choice of dragon | As the dragon |


**Heightened (+ 1)** You shape 1 additional dragon, and the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) damage increases by `1d6`.
