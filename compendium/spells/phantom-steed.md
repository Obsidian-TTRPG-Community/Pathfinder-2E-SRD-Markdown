The horse is clearly phantasmal in nature, has 20 AC and 10 Hit Points, and automatically fails all saves. If it's reduced to 0 Hit Points, it disappears and the spell ends. The steed has a Speed of 40 feet and can hold its rider's body weight, plus 20 Bulk.

**Heightened (4th)** The steed has a Speed of 60 feet, can walk on water, and ignores areas of natural difficult terrain.

**Heightened (5th)** The steed has a Speed of 60 feet, can walk on water, and ignores areas of natural difficult terrain. It can also air walk but must end its turn on solid ground or fall.
