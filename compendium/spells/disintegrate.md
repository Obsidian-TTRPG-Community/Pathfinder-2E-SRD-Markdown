# Disintegrate *Spell 6*   
[attack](rules/traits/attack.md "Attack Combat Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**1 creature or unattended object
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude

You fire a green ray at your target. Make a spell attack. On a hit you deal `12d10` damage, and the target must attempt a basic Fortitude save. On a critical hit, treat the save result as one degree worse. A creature reduced to 0 HP is reduced to fine powder; its gear remains.

An object you hit is destroyed (no save), regardless of Hardness, unless it's an artifact or similarly hard to destroy.

A single casting can destroy no more than a 10-foot cube of matter. This automatically destroys any force construct, such as a wall of force.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d10`.
