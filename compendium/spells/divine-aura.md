# Divine Aura *Spell 8*   
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [aura](rules/traits/aura.md "Aura Combat Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**: 10-foot emanation
- **Targets**: allies in the area
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

Divine power wards the targets, granting each a +1 status bonus to AC and saves while in the area.

Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity or your deity is true neutral. This spell gains the trait of the alignment you chose. The bonuses granted by the spell increase to +2 against attacks by—and effects created by—creatures with an alignment opposite to the spell (lawful if you chose chaotic, evil if you chose good). These bonuses increase to +4 against effects created by such creatures that attempt to impose the [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) condition on a target of your divine aura, as well as against attacks made by creatures summoned by anything opposite in alignment to your divine aura.

When a creature of opposite alignment hits a target with a melee attack, the creature must succeed at a Will save or be [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 minute. It's then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

The first time you [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) each round, the divine aura's radius grows 10 feet.
