> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** Calming urges impose a â€“1 status penalty to the creature's attack rolls.
> - **Failure** Any [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effects that would affect the creature are suppressed and the creature can't use [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) actions. If the target is subject to hostility from any other creature, it ceases to be affected by calm emotions.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but hostility doesn't end the effect.
