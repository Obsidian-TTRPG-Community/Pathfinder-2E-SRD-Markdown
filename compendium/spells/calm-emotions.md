- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Area**: 10-foot burst
- **Saving Throw**: Will
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

You forcibly calm creatures in the area, soothing them into a nonviolent state; each creature must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** Calming urges impose a –1 status penalty to the creature's attack rolls.
> - **Failure** Any [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effects that would affect the creature are suppressed and the creature can't use [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) actions. If the target is subject to hostility from any other creature, it ceases to be affected by calm emotions.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but hostility doesn't end the effect.
