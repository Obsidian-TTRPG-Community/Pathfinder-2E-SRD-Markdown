You create an echo of a powerful poltergeist, temporarily anchoring it to the area to terrorize and harm any opponents foolish enough to remain in the area. Because the poltergeist is a manifestation and is not truly present, it can't be attacked or hurt; it remains [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) unless otherwise stated. When you [Cast the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), and the first time you Sustain it on subsequent rounds, the poltergeist creates your choice of one of the following effects.

- **Deathly Assault** ([negative](rules/traits/negative.md)) The poltergeist focuses on one creature in the area and flies through that creature's space, dealing `4d10` negative damage (basic Fortitude save).
- **Frighten** ([emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md), [fear](rules/traits/fear.md), [mental](rules/traits/mental.md)) The poltergeist becomes visible, appearing as a skeletal, ghostlike humanoid. Creatures in the area must attempt a Will save, becoming [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a failure.
- **Telekinetic Storm** ([force](rules/traits/force.md)) The poltergeist hurls debris and quasi-real objects around in the area. All creatures in the area take `4d8` force damage (basic Reflex save).

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage of the deathly assault effect increases by `1d10`, and the damage of the telekinetic storm effect increases by `1d8`.
