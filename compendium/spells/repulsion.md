# Repulsion *Spell 6*   
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [aura](rules/traits/aura.md)  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**40 foot
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**1 minute

You manifest an aura that prevents creatures from approaching you. When casting the spell, you can make the area any radius you choose, up to 40 feet. A creature must attempt a Will save if it's within the area when you cast the spell or as soon as it enters the area while the spell is in effect. Once a creature has attempted the save, it uses the same result for that casting of repulsion. Any restrictions on a creature's movement apply only if it voluntarily moves toward you. For example, if you move closer to a creature, it doesn't then need to move away.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature's movement is not restricted.
> - **Success** The creature treats each square in the area as difficult terrain when moving closer to you.
> - **Failure** The creature can't move closer to you within the area.
