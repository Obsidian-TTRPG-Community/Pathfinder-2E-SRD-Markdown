You stun the target with an arcane word of power. Once targeted, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. The effect of the spell depends on the target's level.

- **14thâ€“15th** The target is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for 1 round.
- **16th or Higher** The target is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The levels at which each outcome applies increase by 2.
