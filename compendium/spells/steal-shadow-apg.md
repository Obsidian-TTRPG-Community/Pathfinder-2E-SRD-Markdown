# Steal Shadow *Focus 3*   
[necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [shadow](rules/traits/shadow.md "Shadow General Trait")  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md "Sorcerer Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 60 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Saving Throw**: Fortitude
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

You steal a creature's shadow, leaving it weakened and vulnerable. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The target takes `3d4` negative damage and is [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for the spell's duration as you tear its shadow away, collecting it in your hand. On subsequent rounds, the first time each round you [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), you can throttle the shadow to deal `3d4` negative damage to the target (basic Fortitude save). Until the spell ends, the target doesn't cast a shadow.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage when the spell is cast and when it is sustained increases by `1d4`.
