# Ode To Ouroboros *Focus 5*   
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [composition](rules/traits/composition.md "Composition Spell Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**: A creature's [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition would reach the value at which they would die.
- **Range**: 60 foot
- **Targets**: the triggering creature

Your ode temporarily staves off death. The target's [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition remains 1 below the value at which it dies. This doesn't help prevent death from effects that kill the target without increasing its [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition, such as disintegrate and [death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait") effects.
