# Telepathy *Spell 4*   
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md)  [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md)  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**10 minutes

You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet. Once you establish a connection by communicating with a creature, the communication is two-way. You can communicate only with creatures that share a language with you.

**Heightened (6th)** Telepathy loses the [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md) trait. You can communicate telepathically with creatures using shared mental imagery even if you don't share a language.
