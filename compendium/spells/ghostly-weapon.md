# Ghostly Weapon *Spell 3*   
[transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 weapon that is either unattended or wielded by you or a willing ally
- **Duration**: 5 minutes

The target weapon becomes translucent and ghostly, and it can affect material and incorporeal creatures and objects. It can be wielded by a corporeal or incorporeal creature and gains the effects of the [ghost touch](compendium/equipment/items/ghost-touch.md) property rune.

If the weapon is magical and already has the maximum number of property runes, the wielder can choose one to suppress to gain [ghost touch](compendium/equipment/items/ghost-touch.md).
