- **Domains**: [healing](compendium/setting/domains.md#Healing)
- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") to [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Area**20-foot emanation
- **Targets**1 living creature per action spent to cast this spell

You snatch creatures from the jaws of death. You can spend 1 to 3 actions [Casting this Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), and you can target a number of creatures equal to the actions spent. Each target regains `3d6` Hit Points. If the target had the [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition, coming back from [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) due to this healing doesn't increase its [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the healing by `1d6`.
