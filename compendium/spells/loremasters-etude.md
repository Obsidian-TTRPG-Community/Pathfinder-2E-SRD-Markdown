- **Cast** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") 
- **Trigger**: You or an ally within range attempts a skill check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md)
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: you or the triggering ally

You call upon your muse's deep mysteries, granting the target a greater ability to think and recall information. Roll the triggering [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) skill check twice and use the better result.
