# Nettleskin *Spell 1*   
[plant](rules/traits/plant.md "Plant Creature Type Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

Thorns sprout from your body; they pass through and don't damage any clothing or armor you wear. Adjacent creatures that hit you with a melee or unarmed attack take `1d4` piercing damage as the nettles jab them and break off. Each time a creature takes damage in this way, nettleskin's duration decreases by 1 round.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d4`.
