- AC = 25 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 30 temporary Hit Points.

- One or more attacks specific to your deity's battle form, which are the only attacks you can [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +33, and you use the listed damage. Melee attacks are Strength based (for the purposes of the [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition, for example) unless they have the [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md) trait, and all ranged attacks are Dexterity based. Attacks that deal positive or negative damage don't heal creatures.
