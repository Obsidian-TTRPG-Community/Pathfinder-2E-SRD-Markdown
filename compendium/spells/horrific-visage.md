[emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait")  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md "Sorcerer Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**: 30-foot-radius emanation centered on you
- **Saving Throw**: Will

You briefly transform your features into the horrific visage of a hag, striking fear into your enemies. Foes in the area must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The foe is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The foe is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Critical Failure** The foe is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened).

**Heightened (5th)** Foes in the area are [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a success, [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a failure, and [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) and [fleeing](rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) for 1 round on a critical failure. They are still unaffected on a critical success.
