# Zeal For Battle *Focus 4*   
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Domains** [zeal](compendium/setting/domains.md#Zeal)
- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**: You and at least 1 ally are about to roll initiative.
- **Range**: 10 foot
- **Targets**: you and the triggering ally

You stoke the righteous anger within yourself and an ally. You and the target ally each roll a d20 and use the higher result for both your initiative rolls. You each still use your own [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) modifier or other statistic to determine your results.
