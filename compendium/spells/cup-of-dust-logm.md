> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 1 hour.
> - **Success** The creature is [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The creature is immediately afflicted by thirst as if it hadn't had a drink in days. It becomes [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) and takes `1d4` damage each hour that can't be healed until it quenches its thirst. No amount of drinking can quench the creature's thirst during the spell's duration.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure but the creature takes `2d4` damage each hour, twice as much as usual for thirst.

**Heightened (+ 3)** The thirst becomes more unbearable, increasing the damage each hour by `1d4`, or by `2d4` on a critical failure.
