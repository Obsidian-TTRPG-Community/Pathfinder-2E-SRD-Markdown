You evoke life essence into the form of water and freeze it, then launch the icicle at a foe. Make a spell attack roll. On a success, the icicle deals `2d6` piercing damage and `1d6` cold damage, and if the target is undead, the icicle deals an additional `1d4` positive damage. On a critical success, the target takes double damage and takes a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round as the icicle lodges inside them before melting away.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The piercing damage and cold damage each increase by `1d6`. The positive damage increases by `1d4`.
