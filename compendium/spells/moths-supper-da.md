# Moth's Supper *Spell 3*   
[necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- 
- **Duration**: 1 hour

You sigh, and your breath transforms into delicate, black-winged butterflies and huge death's-head hawkmoths. They flutter about you briefly, and then range forth in search of sustenanceâ€”fresh-spilled blood, by preference, but rotting corpses, flowering plants, or even left-behind food will do in a pinch. They then return, perching on your hair or shoulders and whispering their secrets into your ears. This has three effects.

- You heal `2d4` Hit Points every 10 minutes.
- The first time during the duration when someone successfully Treats your Wounds, you regain an additional `4d4` Hit Points.
- You gain an imprecise sense out to 30 feet that senses only freshly spilled blood and rotten flesh.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The amount of Hit Points healed every 10 minutes increases by `1d4` and the amount of Hit Points regained from the first [Treat Wounds](rules/actions/treat-wounds.md) increases by `2d4`.
