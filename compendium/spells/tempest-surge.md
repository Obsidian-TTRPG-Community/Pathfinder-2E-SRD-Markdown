# Tempest Surge *Focus 1*   
[air](rules/traits/air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait")  [druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  [electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Saving Throw**: Reflex

You surround a foe in a swirling storm of violent winds, roiling clouds, and crackling lightning. The storm deals `1d12` electricity damage. The target must attempt a basic Reflex save. On a failure, the target also is [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 round and takes 1 [persistent electricity damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The initial damage increases by `1d12`, and the [persistent electricity damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) on a failure increases by 1.
