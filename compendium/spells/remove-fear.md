# Remove Fear *Spell 2*   
[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 creature

With a touch, you ease a creature's fears. You can attempt to counteract a single [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effect that the target suffers from.

This frees only the target, not any other creatures under the [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effect.

**Heightened (6th)** The spell's range increases to 30 feet, and you can target up to 10 creatures.
