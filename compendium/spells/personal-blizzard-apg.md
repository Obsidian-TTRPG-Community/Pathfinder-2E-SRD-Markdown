> - **Failure** The target takes `1d6` cold damage and `1d6` [persistent cold damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). (The [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) automatically ends when the spell ends.) It is [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to other creatures, and other creatures are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to it.
