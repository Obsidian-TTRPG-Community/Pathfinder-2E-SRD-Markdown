# Volcanic Eruption *Spell 7*   
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Traditions** [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Area**: 5-foot radius, 80-foot-tall cylinder
- **Saving Throw**: Reflex

The ground opens up, spraying a column of lava high into the air in a vertical cylinder, dealing `14d6` fire damage to creatures in the area. The lava rapidly cools and encases creatures in the area. A creature encased in rock is [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speeds. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to a flying creature, and such creatures immediately descend 20 feet the moment they're encased, but they don't take damage from this fall. A creature encased in rock can attempt to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) against your spell DC to end the effect. Otherwise, the creature remains encased until it takes a total of 50 damage, freeing it from the rock.

Additionally, creatures in the area and those within 5 feet of the lava column automatically take `3d6` fire damage from the intense heat, regardless of the results of their saving throws.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is encased.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is encased.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage in the area increases by `2d6`, and the damage from the intense heat increases by `1d6`.
