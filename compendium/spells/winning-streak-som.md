# Winning Streak *Spell 4*   
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: 20 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Duration**: 1 round (see text)

The target is energized by its good fortune as it spreads to othersâ€”as long as they keep winning. It gains the [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) condition for 1 round. If the target or one of their allies within 20 feet gets a critical success on an attack roll against a significant foe, whoever got the critical success becomes [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) if they weren't already, and the duration of the winning streak is extended by another round. Creatures [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) by the spell can use the extra action to [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), [Step](rules/actions/step.md), or [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md). If a full round passes without the target or one their allies critically succeeding on an attack roll against a significant foe, the winning streak breaks and the spell ends.
