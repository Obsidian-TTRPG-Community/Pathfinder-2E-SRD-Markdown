You lash a target with tendrils of shadow that steal some of its substance, making it quasi-real. As long as it is quasireal, its [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) deal half damage, it can't critically succeed at any skill check, and creatures attempting saving throws against its spells and effects get a result one degree of success better than they rolled. The target must attempt a Will saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is quasi-real until the end of its next turn.
> - **Failure** The target is quasi-real for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt another Will save, ending the spell on a success.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is quasi-real for an unlimited duration.
