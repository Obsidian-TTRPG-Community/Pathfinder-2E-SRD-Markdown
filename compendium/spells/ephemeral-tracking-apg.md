# Ephemeral Tracking *Focus 3*   
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md)  [ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 hour

You can look at currents in the air and water and see tracks that you can follow just as you would on land. You can use [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) to [Track](rules/actions/track.md) through both air and water, noticing aerial or aquatic "tracks" of all creatures who passed nearby in the last hour. It's more difficult to [Track](rules/actions/track.md) in this way: the DC to [Track](rules/actions/track.md) through air or water is always at least 30, or higher after precipitation or wind (in the air) or heavy tides or currents (in the water). It's possible to [Cover Tracks](rules/actions/cover-tracks.md) against this spell, but creatures might not realize they need to do so.
