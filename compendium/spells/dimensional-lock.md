- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")

- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Area**: 60-foot burst
- **Duration**: until the next time you make your daily preparations

You create a shimmering barrier that attempts to counteract [teleportation](rules/traits/teleportation.md "Teleportation Effect Trait") effects and planar travel into or out of the area, including items that allow access to extradimensional spaces (such as a bag of holding). Dimensional lock tries to counteract any attempt to summon a creature into the area but doesn't stop the creature from departing when the summoning ends.
