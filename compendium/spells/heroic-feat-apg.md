- **Mystery** Oracle

You gain the ability to perform a specialized combat technique from the vast wealth of martial knowledge your mystery provides. When you [Cast this Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), you use the action granted by one common fighter feat from pages 144–153 of the Core Rulebook or pages 126–127 of this book (your GM might add feats to this list). If you [Cast this Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) using 2 actions, the granted action must be a single action, and if you [Cast this Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) using 3 actions, you can instead choose a feat that grants a 2-action activity. The chosen feat's level can be no higher than heroic feat's spell level. The feat can't have a Frequency entry, and you must meet its prerequisites and requirements in order to select it.
