You afflict the target with the curse of the roiling, unforgiving sea. The target must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target becomes [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened). Reducing its [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition to 0 ends the curse.
> - **Failure** The target becomes [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and can't reduce its [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition below 1 while the curse remains. The curse can be lifted by remove curse or similar magic. Whenever the target is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and on the water at least a mile from shore, it is also [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed).
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target becomes [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
