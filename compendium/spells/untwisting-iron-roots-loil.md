# Untwisting Iron Roots *Focus 5*   
[earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Area**: 10-foot emanation

You manipulate the earth beneath your feet to throw your enemies off balance, leaving chunks of rock and rubble behind. Creatures within range take `2d6` bludgeoning damage, with a basic Reflex save; on a failed save, they also fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone). The affected area becomes difficult terrain, but you can move through the difficult terrain normally.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
