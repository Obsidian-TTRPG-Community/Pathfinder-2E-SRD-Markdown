You create an area of bright light. Creatures with light blindness (Bestiary 343) that are [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by radiant field and remain in the area must attempt a Fortitude save at the start of their turns. On a failure, a creature remains [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round; this is an [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md) effect. This spell also suppresses magical darkness of your radiant field spell's level or lower.

**Heightened (4th)** Creatures seen through the area are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to creatures with light blindness, even those that are outside the area.
