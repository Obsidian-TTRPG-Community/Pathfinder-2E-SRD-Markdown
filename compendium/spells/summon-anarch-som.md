# Summon Anarch *Spell 5*   
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

You conjure a [chaotic](rules/traits/chaotic.md "Chaotic Alignment Trait") [celestial](rules/traits/celestial.md "Celestial Creature Type Trait"), [monitor](rules/traits/monitor.md "Monitor Creature Type Trait"), or [fiend](rules/traits/fiend.md "Fiend Creature Type Trait") to fight on your behalf. You summon a common chaotic creature that has the [celestial](rules/traits/celestial.md "Celestial Creature Type Trait"), [monitor](rules/traits/monitor.md "Monitor Creature Type Trait"), or [fiend](rules/traits/fiend.md "Fiend Creature Type Trait") trait and whose level is 5 or lower. You can't summon a creature unless its alignment is one of your deity's preferred alignments (or, if you don't have a deity, is within one step of your alignment). At the GM's discretion, some deities might restrict specific types of creatures, even if their alignments match. Heightening the spell increases the maximum level of creature you can summon.
