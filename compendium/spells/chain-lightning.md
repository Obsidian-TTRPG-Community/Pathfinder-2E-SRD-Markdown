# Chain Lightning *Spell 6*   
[electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**500 foot
- **Targets**1 creature, plus any number of additional creatures
- **Saving Throw** Reflex

You discharge a powerful bolt of lightning at the target, dealing `8d12` electricity damage. The target must attempt a basic Reflex save. The electricity arcs to another creature within 30 feet of the first target, jumps to another creature within 30 feet of that target, and so on. You can end the chain at any point. You can't target the same creature more than once, and you must have line of effect to all targets. Roll the damage only once, and apply it to each target (halving or doubling as appropriate for its saving throw outcome). The chain ends if any one of the targets critically succeeds at its save.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d12`.
