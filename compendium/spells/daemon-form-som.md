- **Duration**: 1 minute

You infuse yourself with the corrupting death and pure malevolence of Abaddon, transforming into a Large daemon battle form. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. When you cast this spell you choose either ceustodaemon, leukodaemon, meladaemon, or piscodaemon. The battle form is Medium if you choose ceustodaemon. While in this form, you gain the [daemon](rules/traits/daemon-b1.md "Daemon Creature Trait") and [fiend](rules/traits/fiend.md "Fiend Creature Type Trait") traits. You have hands in this battle form and can use manipulate actions. You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of the form that you choose:

- AC = 21 + your level. Ignore your armor check's penalty and Speed reduction.
- 15 temporary Hit Points and weakness 5 to good.
- A +2 status bonus to all saving throws against [death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait") effects.
- Resistance 10 to poison.
- [Darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md).
- One or more attacks specific to the battle form you use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +21, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) modifier of +23, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of Daemon you choose:

- **Ceustodaemon** Speed 25 feet; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") jaws (reach <10 feet>), **Damage** `2d10+10` piercing plus `1d6` evil; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") claw (agile, reach <10 feet>), **Damage** `2d6` slashing plus `1d6` evil; any successful jaws or claw [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) deals an additional `1d6` damage, and you take the same amount of damage.
- **Leukodaemon** Speed 25 feet, fly 40 feet; +2 status bonus to saves against diseases; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") jaws (reach <10 feet>), **Damage** `2d10+10` piercing plus `1d6` evil; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") claw (agile, reach <10 feet>), **Damage** `2d6` slashing plus `1d6` evil; **Ranged** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") composite longbow (deadly <d10>, range increment <100 feet>, volley), **Damage** `2d8` piercing plus `1d6` evil.
