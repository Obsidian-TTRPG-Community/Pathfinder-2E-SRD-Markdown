- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature that isn't on its home plane
- **Saving Throw**: Will

You send the target back to its home plane. The target must attempt a Will save. You can spend an extra action while [Casting this Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) and add a material component to give the creature a â€“2 circumstance penalty to its save. The component must be a specially gathered object that is anathema to the creature, and not from a spell component pouch. This spell fails if you aren't on your home plane when you cast it.

> [!success-degree]

> - **Failure** The target is banished.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is banished and can't return by any means to the plane it's banished from for 1 week.

**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to 10 creatures. The extra material component affects targets to which it is anathema.
