# Nature Incarnate *Spell 10*   
[polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- 
- **Duration**: 1 minute

The primal power of the world flows through you. You transform into an incarnation of nature, either a green man or a kaiju. Your battle form is Medium for a green man or Gargantuan (30-foot-by-30-foot space) for a kaiju. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. While in this form, you gain the [plant](rules/traits/plant.md "Plant Creature Type Trait") trait (for a green man) or the [beast](rules/traits/beast.md "Beast Creature Type Trait") trait (for a kaiju). You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

- AC = 25 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 30 temporary Hit Points.
- [Darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md).
- One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +34, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) modifier of +36, unless your own modifier is higher. You also gain specific abilities based on the type of incarnation you choose:
- **Green Man** Speed 40 feet, climb Speed 40 feet; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") vines ([reach <30 feet>](rules/traits/reach-30-feet.md "Reach Weapon Trait"), [versatile <P>](rules/traits/versatile-p.md "Versatile Weapon Trait")), **Damage** `6d8+12` bludgeoning; **Ranged** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") thorns (range <100 feet>), **Damage** `6d6+6` piercing; Green Caress (aura, primal, transmutation) 60 feet. Enemies other than plants must succeed at a Fortitude save against your spell DC or become [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 round ([clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) on a critical failure).
- **Kaiju** Speed 50 feet; resistance 5 to physical damage; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") jaws ([reach <30 feet>](rules/traits/reach-30-feet.md "Reach Weapon Trait")), **Damage** `6d10+10` piercing; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") claws (agile, reach <30 feet>), **Damage** `6d8+8` slashing; **Melee** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") foot (agile, reach <15 feet>), **Damage** `6d6+10` bludgeoning; Unstoppable You are immune to being [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) and ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain; Trample [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") You move up to double your Speed and move through the spaces of Huge or smaller creatures, trampling each creature whose space you enter. A trampled creature takes foot damage with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC.
