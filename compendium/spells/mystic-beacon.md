[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Domains**: [magic](compendium/setting/domains.md#Magic)

- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 willing creature
- **Duration**until the start of your next turn

The next damaging or healing spell the target casts before the start of your next turn deals damage or restores Hit Points as if the spell were heightened 1 level higher than its actual level. The spell otherwise functions at its actual level. Once the target casts the spell, mystic beacon ends.
