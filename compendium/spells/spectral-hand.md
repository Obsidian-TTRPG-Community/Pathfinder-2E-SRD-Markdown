# Spectral Hand *Spell 2*   
[necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You create a semicorporeal hand out of your essence that delivers touch spells for you. Whenever you [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with a range of touch, you can have the hand crawl to a target within range along the ground, touch it, and then crawl back to you.

When making a melee spell attack with the hand, you use your normal bonuses. The hand can move as far as it needs to within range. The hand has your AC and saves, but any damage to the hand destroys it and causes you to take `1d6` damage.
