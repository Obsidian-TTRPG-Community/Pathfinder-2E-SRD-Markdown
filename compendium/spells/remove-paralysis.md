# Remove Paralysis *Spell 2*   
[healing](rules/traits/healing.md "Healing Effect Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 creature

A surge of energy frees a [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) creature. You can attempt to counteract a single effect imposing the [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) condition on the target. This does not cure someone who is [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) from some natural state or effect, such as paralysis caused by non-magical wounds or toxins.

**Heightened (6th)** The spell's range increases to 30 feet, and you can target up to 10 creatures.
