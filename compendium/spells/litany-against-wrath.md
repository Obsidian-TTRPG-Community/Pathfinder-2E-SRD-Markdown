# Litany Against Wrath *Focus 3*   
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [good](rules/traits/good.md "Good Alignment Trait")  [litany](rules/traits/litany.md "Litany Spell Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 evil creature
- **Saving Throw**: Will
- **Duration**: 1 round

Your litany rails against the sin of wrath, punishing the target for attacking good creatures. The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly wrathful creature, such as a wrath demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. The target then becomes temporarily immune to all of your litanies for 1 minute.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The first time the target uses an action that deals damage to at least one good creature, the target takes `3d6` good damage.
> - **Failure** Each time the target uses an action that deals damage to at least one good creature, the target takes `3d6` good damage.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled). Each time it uses an action that deals damage to at least one good creature, the target takes `3d6` good damage.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
