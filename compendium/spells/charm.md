To the target, your words are honey and your visage seems bathed in a dreamy haze. It must attempt a Will save, with a +4 circumstance bonus if you or your allies recently threatened it or used [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) actions against it.

You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell. If you use [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) actions against the target, the spell ends. When the spell ends, the target doesn't necessarily realize it was charmed unless its friendship with you or the actions you convinced it to take clash with its expectations, meaning you could potentially convince the target to continue being your friend via mundane means.
