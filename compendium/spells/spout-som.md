Water blasts upward, coming out of the ground, rising from a pool, or even manifesting from thin air. Any creatures in the area take bludgeoning damage equal to `1d4` plus your spellcasting ability modifier, with a basic Reflex saving throw.

You can change this spell's area to a 5-foot burst, provided you center the burst in a body of water. This body of water can be as small as a pond or creek, but not as small as a puddle or bathtub.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d4`.
