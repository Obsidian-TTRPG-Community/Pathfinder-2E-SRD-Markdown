# Inner Radiance Torrent *Spell 2*   
[force](rules/traits/force.md "Force Energy & Element Trait")  [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") to 2 rounds 
- **Area**: line 60 feet or longer
- **Saving Throw**:  basic Reflex

You gradually manifest your spiritual energy into your cupped hands before firing off a storm of bolts and beams that deal `4d4` force damage to all creatures in a 60-foot line. Creatures in the area must attempt a basic Reflex save. On a critical failure, they're also [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round.

The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines the area. If the line passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, inner radiance torrent attempts to counteract the darkness.

**[>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") (somatic, verbal)** The line is 60 feet long.

**[>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") (material, somatic, verbal)** The line is 120 feet long.

**Two Rounds** The line is 120 feet long. If you spend 3 actions casting the spell, you can avoid finishing the spell and spend another 3 actions on your next turn to empower the spell even further. If you choose to do so, the damage dealt by this spell increases by `4d4`, and you enter a shining state for 1 minute, causing you to glow with light and deal 1 force damage to creatures that end their turn adjacent to you.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The initial damage, as well as the additional damage for the 2-round casting time, each increase by `4d4`, and the damage to adjacent creatures dealt while in your shining state increases by 1.
