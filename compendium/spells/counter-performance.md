# Counter Performance *Focus 1*   
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md)  [composition](rules/traits/composition.md)  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md)  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**You or an ally within 60 feet rolls a saving throw against an [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md) or [visual](rules/traits/visual.md) effect.
- **Area**60-foot emanation

Your performance protects you and your allies. Roll a [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check for a type you know: an auditory performance if the trigger was auditory, or a visual one for a visual trigger. You and allies in the area can use the better result between your [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check and the saving throw.
