# Counter Performance *Focus 1*   
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [composition](rules/traits/composition.md "Composition Spell Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**: You or an ally within 60 feet rolls a saving throw against an [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") or [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") effect.
- **Area**: 60-foot emanation

Your performance protects you and your allies. Roll a [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check for a type you know: an auditory performance if the trigger was auditory, or a visual one for a visual trigger. You and allies in the area can use the better result between your [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check and the saving throw.
