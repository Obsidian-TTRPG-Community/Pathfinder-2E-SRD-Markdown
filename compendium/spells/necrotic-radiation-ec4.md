You imbue the touched object or space with slow-acting necrotic radiation. If you cast the spell on an object, any creature ending its turn holding or carrying the object takes `2d6` negative damage. If you cast the spell on an area, any creature ending its turn in the area takes `2d6` negative damage. You can attempt to use this spell on an attended object by touching the object. If you do, the creature attempts a Reflex save to reduce the effect.

> - **Success** The creature pulls the object away quickly. The spell only lasts 1 minute.
> - **Failure** The creature manages to slightly protect the object. The spell lasts 10 minutes.
