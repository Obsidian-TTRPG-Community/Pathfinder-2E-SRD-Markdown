As you attack a foe, warding magic transforms your momentum into action and lifts your shield. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). You can then either [Raise your Shield](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md) if you're wielding one or cast [shield](compendium/spells/shield.md) if you have the spell.
