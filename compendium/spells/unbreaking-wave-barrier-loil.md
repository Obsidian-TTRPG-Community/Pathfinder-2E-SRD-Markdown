# Unbreaking Wave Barrier *Focus 7*   
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Area**: 5-foot emanation
- **Saving Throw**: Fortitude or Fortitude
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

You create a protective circle around yourself that repels your foes. You gain a +1 status bonus to AC. Any creature other than you within the area, or attempting to move into the area, must attempt a Fortitude saving throw; a creature needs to attempt the Fortitude saving throw only once each round.

If a creature pushed by unbreaking wave barrier would be pushed into a solid barrier or another creature, it stops at that point and takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage for every additional 5 feet it would've been pushed. On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain this Spell each round, you can increase the radius of the barrier by 5 feet.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature isn't pushed, but the space within the barrier is difficult terrain for it.
> - **Failure** The creature is pushed 10 feet, and the space within the barrier is difficult terrain for it.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 20 feet and knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone), and the space within the barrier is difficult terrain for it.
