# Fiery Body *Spell 7*   
[fire](rules/traits/fire.md)  [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md)  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

You become living flame, giving you fire immunity, resistance 10 to precision damage, and weakness 5 to cold and to water. Any creature that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon takes `3d6` fire damage.

Your unarmed attacks deal `1d4` additional fire damage, and your fire spells deal one additional die of fire damage (of the same damage die the spell uses). You can cast [produce flame](compendium/spells/produce-flame.md) as an innate spell; the casting is reduced from 2 actions to 1.

In fire form, you have a fly Speed of 40 feet and don't need to breathe.

**Heightened (9th)** Creatures touching you take `4d6` fire damage instead of `3d6`, your unarmed attacks deal `2d4` additional fire damage, and you have a fly Speed of 60 feet.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
