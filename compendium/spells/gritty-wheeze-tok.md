- **Area**: 15-foot cone
- **Saving Throw**: Fortitude
- **Duration**: see below

You exhale desiccating grit and sand in a small cloud. Creatures in the area take `2d4` bludgeoning damage and must attempt a Fortitude save. Water creatures and plant creatures use the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of their saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d4`.
