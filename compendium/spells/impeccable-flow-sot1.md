You attune yourself to an underlying cosmic order to the world. While you remain in tune with this power, you gain a +1 status bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks, saving throws, and skill checks. If you critically fail any check while under the effects of this spell, the bonus ends and you instead have a â€“1 status penalty to all checks for the remaining duration.

**Heightened (5th)** The status bonus increases to +2.

**Heightened (8th)** The status bonus increases to +3.
