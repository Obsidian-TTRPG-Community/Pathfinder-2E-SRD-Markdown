# Ki Form *Focus 9*   
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

Drawing from deep wells of spiritual power, you take on a special ki form. In your ki form, your hair, feathers, skin, or scales change color and begin to glow. In this form you gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed. Choose force, lawful (only if you are lawful), negative, or positive damage. All your [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) deal `1d6` additional damage of the chosen type. Your entire body is also surrounded by a glowing corona of the same color as your inner ki; this is a [light](rules/traits/light.md) effect. Your corona is a 5-foot emanation that deals `2d6` damage of the chosen type to creatures who start their turn within the emanation. If the emanation overlaps with a [darkness](rules/traits/darkness.md) effect, the corona's glow attempts to counteract the [darkness](rules/traits/darkness.md) effect. Regardless of the outcome, the corona can't attempt to counteract that effect again for 1 day. As a single action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait, you can flare your corona out to become a 30-foot emanation.

In your ki form, your emotions surge to the forefront and it's difficult to moderate your attacks. Your weapons and unarmed attacks lose the [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md) trait. You take a â€“2 status penalty to saves against [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md) effects but gain a +2 status bonus to saves against all other [mental](rules/traits/mental.md) effects.
