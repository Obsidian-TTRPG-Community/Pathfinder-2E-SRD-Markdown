# Sonata Span *Spell 2*   
[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Traditions** [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**: 30-foot line
- **Duration**: sustained

By playing a brief tune on an instrument or in song, you cause the notes of the melody to physically manifest into a shimmering, translucent path. This path doesn't need to be over solid ground and can tilt up or down diagonally up to 45 degrees, but it must be a straight, 5-foot-wide line.

It can support as many creatures as can physically fit on the bridge.
