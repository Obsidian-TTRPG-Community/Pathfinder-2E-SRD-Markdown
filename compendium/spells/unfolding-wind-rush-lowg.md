# Unfolding Wind Rush *Focus 3*   
[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- 

You travel on a rushing wind. Move two times: two [Strides](rules/actions/stride.md), two [Steps](rules/actions/step.md), or one [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) and one [Step](rules/actions/step.md) (in either order). You can [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) or [Step](rules/actions/step.md) into the air during this movement, moving upward at a 45-degree angle at most; if you end your movement in the air, you fall after taking one action or when your turn ends, whichever comes first. A [wall of wind](compendium/spells/wall-of-wind.md) appears in all the spaces you left during this movement, lasting for 1 round.

**Heightened (5th)** The wall of wind lasts 3 rounds.
