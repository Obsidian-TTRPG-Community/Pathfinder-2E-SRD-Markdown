The target is overcome with an all-consuming urge to dance.

For the duration of the spell, the target is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) and can't use reactions. While affected, the creature can't use actions with the [move](rules/traits/move.md "Move Combat Trait") trait except to dance, using the [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) action to move up to half its Speed.
