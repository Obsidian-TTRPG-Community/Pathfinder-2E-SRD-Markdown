# Miracle *Spell 10*   
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](rules/traits/divine.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 

You request aid directly from your divine source. Your divine source always refuses a request out of line with its nature, and it might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its nature) than the one you asked for. A casting of miracle can do any of the following things.

- Duplicate any spell from the divine list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
- Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be [common](rules/traits/common.md) or you must have access.
- Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
- Reverse certain effects that refer to the [wish](compendium/spells/wish.md) spell.

The GM might allow you to try using miracle to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.
