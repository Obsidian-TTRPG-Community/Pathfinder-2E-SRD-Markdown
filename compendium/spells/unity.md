- **Domains** [family](compendium/setting/domains.md#Family)
- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**: You and 1 or more allies within range are targeted by a spell or ability that allows a saving throw.
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: each ally targeted by the triggering spell

You put up a united defense. Each ally can use your saving throw modifier instead of its own against the triggering spell.

Each ally decides individually which modifier to use.
