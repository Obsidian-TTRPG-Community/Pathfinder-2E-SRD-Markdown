Channeling the mischievous fey, you transform into a fey battle form, which is Medium unless stated otherwise.

When you cast this spell, choose dryad, elananx, naiad, redcap, or unicorn. If you choose unicorn, the battle form is Large and you must have space to expand or the spell is lost. While in this form, you gain the [fey](rules/traits/fey.md) trait. Unless you choose elananx or unicorn, you have hands in this battle form and can use manipulate actions. You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of the form that you choose:

- AC = 19 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 15 temporary Hit Points and weakness 5 to cold iron.
- Low-light vision.
- One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +16, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Dexterity based. If your attack modifier is higher for the given unarmed attack or weapon, you can use it instead.
- [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) modifiers of +16, unless your own modifier is higher.
