# Achaekek's Clutch *Focus 4*   
[curse](rules/traits/curse.md)  [death](rules/traits/death.md)  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will

You mark the holy symbol of [Achaekek](compendium/setting/deities/achaekek-logm.md) in a visible location on the target's body.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is marked by Achaekek's symbol. For 1 minute, the first time per round that the target gains [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), they immediately take that amount of slashing damage as the mantis claws grow off the symbol and rake them.
> - **Failure** As success, but the curse has an unlimited duration.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the DC on the target's flat check to remove [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases to 20 (15 with particularly effective assistance).
