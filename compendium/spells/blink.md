- **Duration**: 1 minute

You blink quickly between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. You gain resistance 5 to all damage (except force). You can [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) to vanish and reappear 10 feet away in a random direction determined by the GM; the movement doesn't trigger reactions. At the end of your turn, you vanish and reappear as above.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The resistance increases by 3.
