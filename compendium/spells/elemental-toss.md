With a flick of your wrist, you fling a chunk of your elemental matter at your foe. Make a spell attack roll, dealing `1d8` bludgeoning damage (or fire damage if your element is fire) on a success, and double damage on a critical success. This spell has your element's trait.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d8`.
