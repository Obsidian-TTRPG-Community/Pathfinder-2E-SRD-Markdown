# Possession *Spell 7*   
[incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [possession](rules/traits/possession.md "Possession Effect Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Traditions** [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 living creature
- **Saving Throw**: Will
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You send your mind and soul into the target's body, attempting to take control. The target must attempt a Will save. You can choose to use the effects of a degree of success more favorable to the target if you prefer.

While you're possessing a target, your own body is [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and can't wake up normally. You can sense everything the possessed target does. You can [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) this spell. If the possessed body dies, the spell ends and you must succeed at a Fortitude save against your spell DC or be [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 hour, or 24 hours on a critical failure. If the spell ends during an encounter, you act just before the possessed creature's initiative count.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** You possess the target but can't control it. You ride along in the body while the spell lasts.
> - **Failure** You possess the target and take partial control of it. You no longer have a separate turn; instead, you might control the target. At the start of each of the target's turns, it attempts another Will save. If it fails, it's [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by you on that turn; if it succeeds, it chooses its own actions; and if it critically succeeds, it forces you out and the spell ends.
> - **Critical Failure** You possess the target fully, and it can only watch as you manipulate it like a puppet. The target is [controlled](rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by you.

**Heightened (9th)** The duration is 10 minutes, and you can physically enter the creature's body, protecting your physical body while the spell lasts.
