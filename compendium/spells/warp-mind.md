# Warp Mind *Spell 7*   
[emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Saving Throw**: Will

You scramble a creature's mental faculties and sensory input.

The target must attempt a Will saving throw. Regardless of the result of that save, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. Warp mind's effects happen instantly, so [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) and other effects that counteract spells can't counteract them. However, [alter reality](compendium/spells/alter-reality.md), [miracle](compendium/spells/miracle.md), [primal phenomenon](compendium/spells/primal-phenomenon.md), [restoration](compendium/spells/restoration.md), or [wish](compendium/spells/wish.md) can still counteract the effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target spends the first action on its next turn with the [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused) condition.
> - **Failure** The target is [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused) for 1 minute.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused) permanently.
