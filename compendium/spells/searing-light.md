- **Range**120 foot

You shoot a blazing ray of light tinged with holy energy. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals `5d6` fire damage. If the target is a fiend or undead, you deal an extra `5d6` good damage.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target takes double fire damage, as well as double good damage if a fiend or undead.
> - **Success** The target takes full damage If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, searing light attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target

**Heightened (+ 1)** The fire damage increases by `2d6`, and the good damage against fiends and undead increases by `2d6`.
