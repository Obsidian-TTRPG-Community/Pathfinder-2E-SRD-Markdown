# Silence *Spell 2*   
[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 willing creature
- **Duration**: 1 minute

The target makes no sound, preventing creatures from noticing it using hearing alone. The target can't use sonic attacks, nor can it use actions with the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") trait. This prevents it from casting spells that include verbal components.

**Heightened (4th)** The spell effect emanates from the touched creature, silencing all sound in or passing through a 10-foot radius and preventing any [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") and [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait") effects in the affected area. While within the radius, creatures are subject to the same effects as the target. Depending upon the position of the effect, a creature might notice the lack of sound reaching it (blocking off the noise coming from a party, for example).
