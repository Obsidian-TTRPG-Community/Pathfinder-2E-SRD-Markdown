[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [druid](rules/traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") 

You enhance a summoned creature with the power of the elements. If your next action is to cast either [summon animal](compendium/spells/summon-animal.md) or [summon plant or fungus](compendium/spells/summon-plant-or-fungus.md), choose [air](rules/traits/air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait"), [earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait"), [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait"), or [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait"), and the creature you summon gains the corresponding abilities.

- **Air** The creature gains a fly Speed of 60 feet.
- **Earth** The creature gains a burrow Speed of 20 feet, reduces its land Speed by 10 feet (minimum 5 feet), and gains resistance 5 to physical damage.
- **Fire** The creature's attacks deal `1d6` extra fire damage, and it gains resistance 10 to fire and weakness 5 to cold and water.
- **Water** The creature gains a swim Speed of 60 feet, can spend 1 action after a melee attack to attempt a [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) (ignoring multiple attack penalty), and gains resistance 5 to fire.
