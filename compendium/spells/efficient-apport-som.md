Walking over to an item to pick it up is so much effort.

Whether it's your spellbook, a reagent, or a glass of wine, it's simply more efficient to call it to your hand. You teleport the target into your open hand. If you don't have a hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet.

**Heightened (3rd)** You can target an unattended object with a Bulk of 1 or less

**Heightened (5th)** The range increases to 120 feet, and you can target an unattended object with a Bulk of 1 or less.

**Heightened (7th)** The range increases to 120 feet, and you can target an unattended object with a Bulk of 2 or less.
