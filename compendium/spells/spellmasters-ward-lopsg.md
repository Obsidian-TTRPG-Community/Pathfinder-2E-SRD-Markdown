# Spellmaster's Ward *Focus 5*   
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") to [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- 
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

You create one or more glowing protective runes that revolve around you. For each additional action you use when [Casting the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), increase the number of runes you create by one, to a maximum of three runes for 3 actions.

When you next take damage from a spell, a rune is expended to prevent `2d6` of that spell's damage. If damage from the triggering spell remains, additional runes are expended until the damage is completely negated, or until all runes have been spent, whichever comes first.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Each rune prevents an additional 1 damage.
