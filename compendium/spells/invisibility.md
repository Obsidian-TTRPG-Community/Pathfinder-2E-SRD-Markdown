# Invisibility *Spell 2*   
[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Duration**: 10 minutes

Cloaked in illusion, the target becomes [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible). This makes it [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making it [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) to them instead (page 466). If the target uses a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action, the spell ends after that [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action is completed.

**Heightened (4th)** The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn't end if the target uses a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action.
