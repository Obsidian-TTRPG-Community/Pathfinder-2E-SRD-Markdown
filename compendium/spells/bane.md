# Bane *Spell 1*   
[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**5-foot emanation
- **Targets**enemies in the area
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**1 minute

You fill the minds of your enemies with doubt. Targets that fail their Will saves take a â€“1 status penalty to attack rolls as long as they are in the area. Once per turn, starting the turn after you cast [bane](compendium/spells/bane.md), you can use a single action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet and force enemies in the area that weren't yet affected to attempt another saving throw. Bane can counteract bless.
