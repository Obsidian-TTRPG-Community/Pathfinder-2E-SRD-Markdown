# Inspire Heroics *Focus 4*   
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") 
- 

You call upon your muse to greatly increase the benefits you provide to your allies with your inspire courage or inspire defense composition. If your next action is to cast [inspire courage](compendium/spells/inspire-courage.md) or inspire defense, attempt a [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check.

The DC is usually a very hard DC of a level equal to that of the highest-level target of your composition, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect of your inspire courage or inspire defense composition depends on the result of your check.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The status bonus from your inspire courage or inspire defense increases to +3.
> - **Success** The status bonus from inspire courage or inspire defense increases to +2.
> - **Failure** Your inspire courage or inspire defense provides only its normal bonus of +1, but you don't spend the Focus Point for casting this spell.
