# Blur *Spell 2*   
[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Duration**: 1 minute

The target's form appears blurry. It becomes [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed). As the nature of this effect still leaves the target's location obvious, the target can't use this concealment to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md).
