# Lament *Focus 1*   
[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Domains**: [sorrow](compendium/setting/domains.md#Sorrow)
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30-foot cone
- **Targets**1 or more creatures
- **Saving Throw**  basic Will

You let out your negative emotions in a guttural wail that shakes your enemies' hearts and deals `1d8` mental damage (basic Will save). If you have any harmful conditions imposed by [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effects, lament deals additional mental damage equal to the counteract level of the highest-level effect.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d8`.
