# Alter Reality *Spell 10*   
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 

You use your occult lore and the power of your mind to manipulate the spiritual multiverse, resulting in any of the following effects:

- Duplicate any spell from the occult list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
- Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be [common](rules/traits/common.md "Common Rarity Trait") or you must have access.
- Produce any effect whose power is equivalent to any occult spell 9th level or lower, or non-occult spell 7th level or lower.
- Reverse certain effects that refer to the [wish](compendium/spells/wish.md) spell.

At the GM's discretion, you can try to produce greater effects, but this is dangerous and the spell may have only a partial effect.
