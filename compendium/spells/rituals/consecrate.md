# Consecrate *Ritual 2*  
[consecration](rules/traits/consecration.md "Consecration Effect Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** 3 days
- **Cost** rare incense and offerings worth a total value of 20 gp × the spell level
- **Secondary Casters** 2 must be worshippers of your religion
- **Primary Checks** [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion)
- **Secondary Checks** [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting), [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance)
- **Range**40 feet
- **Area**40-foot-radius burst around an immobile altar, shrine, or fixture of your deity

You consecrate a site to your deity, chanting praises and creating a sacred space. While within the area, worshippers of your deity gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks, and creatures anathema to your deity (such as undead for [Pharasma](compendium/setting/deities/pharasma.md) or [Sarenrae](compendium/setting/deities/sarenrae.md)) take a –1 status penalty to those checks. Attacks made by worshippers of your deity within the area deal 1 damage of one of your deity's alignment types (your choice); if your deity is true neutral, you don't gain this benefit.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The consecration succeeds, and it either lasts for 10 years instead of 1 or covers an area with twice the radius. Occasionally, with your deity's favor, this might produce an even more amazing effect, such as a permanently consecrated area or the effect covering an entire cathedral.
> - **Success** The consecration succeeds.
> - **Failure** The consecration fails.
> - **Critical Failure** The consecration fails spectacularly and angers your deity, who sends a sign of displeasure. For at least 1 year, further attempts to consecrate the site fail.

**Heightened (7th)** The consecrated area also gains the effects of the [dimensional lock](compendium/spells/dimensional-lock.md) spell, but the effect doesn't attempt to counteract teleportation by worshippers of your deity. The cost increases to 200 gp × the spell level.
