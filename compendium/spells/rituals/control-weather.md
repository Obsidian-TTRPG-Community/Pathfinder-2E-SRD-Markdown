- **Cast** 1 day
- **Secondary Casters** 1
- **Primary Checks** [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature) (master)
- **Secondary Checks** [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival)
- **Area**: 2-mile-radius circle centered on you

You alter the weather, making it calm and normal for the season or choosing up to two effects based on the season:

- Spring drizzle, heat, hurricane, sleet, thunderstorm, tornado
- Summer drizzle, downpour, extreme heat, hail, heat
- Autumn cold weather, fog, mild heat, sleet
- Winter blizzard, mild cold, extreme cold, thaw You can't specifically control the manifestations, such as the exact path of a tornado or the targets of lightning strikes.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You change the weather as desired and can affect a larger area (up to a 5-mile-radius circle), or a longer duration (any number of additional d12 hours, up to `16d12`).
> - **Success** You change the weather as desired.
> - **Failure** You fail to change the weather as desired.
> - **Critical Failure** The weather changes in an unanticipated way, determined by the GM but generally as contradictory to your true desires as possible (for instance, a terrible storm emerges when you would prefer good weather).

**Heightened (9th)** You can create unseasonable weather and contradictory weather effects, such as extreme cold and a hurricane. You can make the weather calm and normal weather for a different season or choose weather effects from any season's list.
