# Create Skinstitch *Ritual 6*  
[transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** 1 day
- **Cost** rare oils worth 480 gp
- **Secondary Casters** 1
- **Primary Checks** [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) (expert)
- **Secondary Checks** [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting)
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 frame covered in the skin of sentient humanoids

You transform the target into a skinstitch, a hideous construct covered in the flesh of sentient humanoids.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target becomes a skinstitch. If it's at least 4 levels lower than you, you can make it a minion which gives it the [minion](rules/traits/minion.md "Minion Creature Trait") trait. You can have a maximum of four minions under your control. If it doesn't become a minion, you can give it one simple command that it pursues single-mindedly. If you aren't a follower of [Norgorber](compendium/setting/deities/norgorber.md), it ignores any of your subsequent commands. A follower of [Norgorber](compendium/setting/deities/norgorber.md) can give the skinstitch simple commands by presenting a holy symbol of the deity and commanding it with a single action that has the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") and [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") traits.
> - **Success** As critical success, except a skinstitch that doesn't become your minion stays in place and attacks anyone that attacks or tries to move it, rather than following your command.
> - **Failure** You fail to create the skinstitch.
> - **Critical Failure** You create the skinstitch, but it goes berserk and attempts to kill you, ignoring your commands even if you are a follower of [Norgorber](compendium/setting/deities/norgorber.md).
