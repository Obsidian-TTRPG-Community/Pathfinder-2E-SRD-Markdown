# Animate Rope *Spell 1*   
[transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**100 foot
- **Targets**up to 50 feet of rope or a nonliving rope-like object
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You cause a length or section of rope or a rope-like object to animate and follow simple commands. You can give it two commands when you [Cast the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), and one command each time you [Sustain the Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md).

- **Bind** ([attack](rules/traits/attack.md "Attack Combat Trait")) The rope attempts to partially bind a creature. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's Reflex DC. If you succeed, the target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed (–20-foot on a critical success). This ends if the target [Escapes](rules/actions/escape.md) against your spell DC or breaks the rope. (A standard adventuring rope has Hardness 2, HP 8, and a [Broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) Threshold of 4.)
- **Coil** The rope forms a tidy, coiled stack.
- **Crawl** The rope inches along the ground like a snake, moving one of its ends 10 feet. The rope must move along a surface, but that surface doesn't need to be horizontal.
- **Knot** The rope ties a sturdy knot in itself.
- **Loop** The rope forms a simple loop at one or both ends, or straightens itself back out.
- **Tie** The rope ties itself around a willing creature or an object that's unattended or attended by a willing creature.
- **Undo** The rope undoes one of its knots, ties, or bindings.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The range increases by 50 feet, and you can animate 50 more feet of rope.
