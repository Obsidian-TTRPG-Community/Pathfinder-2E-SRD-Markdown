# Phase Familiar *Focus 1*   
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [hex](rules/traits/hex-apg.md "Hex Combat Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  [witch](rules/traits/witch-apg.md "Witch Class Trait")  

- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**: Your familiar would take damage.
- **Range**: 60 foot
- **Targets**: your familiar

You draw upon your patron's power to momentarily shift your familiar from its solid, physical form into an ephemeral version of itself shaped of mist. Your familiar gains resistance 5 to all damage and is immune to precision damage. These apply only against the triggering damage.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the resistance by 2.
