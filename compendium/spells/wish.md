# Wish *Spell 10*   
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 

You state a wish, making your greatest desire come true. A [wish](compendium/spells/wish.md) spell can produce any one of the following effects.

- Duplicate any spell from the arcane list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
- Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be [common](rules/traits/common.md "Common Rarity Trait") or you must have access.
- Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
- Reverse certain effects that refer to the [wish](compendium/spells/wish.md) spell.

The GM might allow you to try using wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so might be dangerous or the spell might have only a partial effect.
