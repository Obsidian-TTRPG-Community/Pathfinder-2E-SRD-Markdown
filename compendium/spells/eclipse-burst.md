# Eclipse Burst *Spell 7*   
[cold](rules/traits/cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait")  [darkness](rules/traits/darkness.md "Darkness Effect Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 500 foot
- **Area**: 60-foot burst
- **Saving Throw**: Reflex

A globe of freezing darkness explodes in the area, dealing `8d10` cold damage to creatures in the area, plus `8d4` additional negative damage to living creatures. Creatures in the area must attempt a Reflex save.

If the globe overlaps with an area of magical light or affects a creature affected by magical light, eclipse burst attempts to counteract the [light](rules/traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait") effect.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature or object is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature or object takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature or object takes full damage.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature or object takes double damage. If it's a creature, it becomes [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by the darkness for an unlimited duration.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The cold damage increases by `1d10` and the negative damage against the living increases by `1d4`.
