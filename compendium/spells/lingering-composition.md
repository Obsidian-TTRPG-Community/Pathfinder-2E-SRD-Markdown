# Lingering Composition *Focus 1*   
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [metamagic](rules/traits/metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") 
- 

You add a flourish to your composition to extend its benefits.

If your next action is to cast a cantrip composition with a duration of 1 round, attempt a [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of a level equal to the highest-level target of your composition, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The composition lasts 4 rounds.
> - **Success** The composition lasts 3 rounds.
> - **Failure** The composition lasts 1 round, but you don't spend the Focus Point for casting this spell.
