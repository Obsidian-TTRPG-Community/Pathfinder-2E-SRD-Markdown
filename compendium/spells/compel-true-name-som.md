- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature whose true name you know
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**varies

You instruct the target to do something, compelling obedience by calling it by its true name. Your instructions can't be self-destructive. Though this spell has the [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait") trait, this applies only to the instructions; the creature doesn't need to know its own true name to be affected.

The target must attempt a Will saving throw.

> - **Success** The target is unaffected, is temporarily immune to further castings of this spell by you for 1 day, and learns a fragment of your true name (see the Fragmentary Names sidebar at right).
> - **Failure** The target does as you command. The spell has a duration of 10 minutes, or until the target has completed a finite instruction or the instructions become selfdestructive. The creature is temporarily immune to further castings of this spell by you for 1 hour.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the spell's duration is 8 hours, and the creature is not temporarily immune.
