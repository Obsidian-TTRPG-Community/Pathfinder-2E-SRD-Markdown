# Primal Phenomenon *Spell 10*   
[divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 

You request a direct intercession from the natural world.

Nature always refuses unnatural requests and might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its character) than the one you asked for. A [primal phenomenon](compendium/spells/primal-phenomenon.md) spell can do any of the following things.

- Duplicate any spell from the primal list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
- Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be [common](rules/traits/common.md "Common Rarity Trait") or you must have access.
- Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
- Reverse certain effects that refer to the [wish](compendium/spells/wish.md) spell.

At the GM's discretion, you can try to use primal phenomenon to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.
