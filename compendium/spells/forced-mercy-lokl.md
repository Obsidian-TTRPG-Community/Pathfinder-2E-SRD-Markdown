You soften the target's blows, ensuring they avoid vital areas and cause no lasting harm. All physical damage dealt by the target to living creatures becomes nonlethal and all [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) dealt by the target is reduced to 0. This effect doesn't incur the typical â€“2 circumstance penalty for nonlethal attacks with a lethal weapon or attack. An unwilling target must attempt a Will save. A willing target can choose to critically fail their saving throw.
