# Ghostly Shift *Cantrip 3*   
[cantrip](rules/traits/cantrip.md "Cantrip Spell Trait")  [conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [psychic](rules/traits/psychic-da.md "Psychic Class Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

Your body becomes insubstantial as you partially phase out. You gain resistance 2 to all damage (except force).

**Heightened (+ 2)** The resistance increases by 1.

## Amp

Your insubstantiality is complete enough that you can pass through other creatures, causing painful interference effects when you do so. Once each round when you [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), [Burrow](rules/actions/burrow.md), [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md), or [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md), you can pass through one creature's space during that action without needing to attempt a check to [Tumble Through](rules/actions/tumble-through.md), though you can't end your turn in its space. When you pass through a creature's space in this way, you deal `2d6` force damage to that creature, with a basic Fortitude save.

**Amp Heightened (+ 2)** Increase the damage dealt by phasing through a creature by `1d6`.
