# Agitate *Spell 1*   
[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md)  [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot

- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**varies

You send the target's mind and body into overdrive, forcing it to become restless and hyperactive.

During the duration, the target must [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) at least once each turn or take `2d8` mental damage that turn. The duration of this effect depends on the target's Will save. The GM might decide to add additional move actions to the list for creatures who possess only a more unusual form of movement.

> - **Critical Failure** The duration is 4 rounds.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d8`.
