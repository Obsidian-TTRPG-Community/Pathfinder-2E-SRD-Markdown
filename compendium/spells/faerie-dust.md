You sprinkle magical dust in the spell's area, making those within easier to trick. Each creature in the area must attempt a Will save. For each additional action you use [Casting the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), the burst's radius increases by 5 feet.

> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature can't use reactions and takes a –2 status penalty to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks and Will saves.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature also takes a –1 status penalty to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks and Will saves for 1 minute.
