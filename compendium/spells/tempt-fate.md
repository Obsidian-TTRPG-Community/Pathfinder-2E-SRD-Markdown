# Tempt Fate *Focus 4*   
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [fortune](rules/traits/fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Domains** [fate](compendium/setting/domains.md#Fate)
- **Cast** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**: You or an ally within range attempts a saving throw.
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Targets**: the triggering creature

You twist the forces of fate to make a moment dire or uneventful, with no in-between. The target gains a +1 status bonus to the triggering saving throw. If the saving throw's result is a success, it becomes a critical success. If it's a failure, it becomes a critical failure, and the critical failure can't be reduced by abilities that usually reduce critical failure, such as improved evasion.

If the triggering ability did not have both a critical success and critical failure condition, tempt fate fails, but you don't expend the Focus Point for [Casting this Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md).

**Heightened (8th)** The bonus on the saving throw is +2.
