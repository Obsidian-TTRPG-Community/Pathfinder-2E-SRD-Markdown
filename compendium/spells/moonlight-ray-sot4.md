You unleash a holy beam of freezing moonlight. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals `5d6` cold damage; if the target is a fiend or undead, you deal an extra `5d6` good damage. Moonlight ray's cold damage is silver damage for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target takes double cold damage, as well as double good damage if a fiend or undead.
> - **Success** The target takes full damage. If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, moonlight ray attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The cold damage increases by `2d6`, and the good damage against fiends and undead increases by `2d6`.
