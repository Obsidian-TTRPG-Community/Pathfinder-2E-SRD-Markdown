# Reinforce Eidolon *Cantrip 1*   
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [cantrip](rules/traits/cantrip.md)  [summoner](rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**100 foot
- **Targets**your eidolon
- **Duration**1 round

You focus deeply on the link between you and your eidolon and reinforce your eidolon's defenses. Your eidolon gains a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws, plus resistance to all damage equal to half the spell's level. Your eidolon can benefit from either [boost eidolon](compendium/spells/boost-eidolon-som.md) or [reinforce eidolon](compendium/spells/reinforce-eidolon-som.md), but not both; if you cast one of these spells during the other's duration, the newer spell replaces the older one.
