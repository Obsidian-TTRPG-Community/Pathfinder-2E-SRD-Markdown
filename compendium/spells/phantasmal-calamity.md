# Phantasmal Calamity *Spell 6*   
[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**500 foot
- **Area**30-foot burst
- **Saving Throw** Will

A vision of apocalyptic destruction fills the mind of each creature in the area. The vision deals `11d6` mental damage (basic Will save). On a critical failure, the creature must also succeed at a Reflex save or believe it's trapped (stuck in a fissure, adrift at sea, or some other fate in keeping with its vision). If it fails the second save, it's also [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for 1 minute. It can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and on a success, it 0 and recovers from the [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) condition.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d6`.
