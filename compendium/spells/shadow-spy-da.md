# Shadow Spy *Spell 3*   
[necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** 1 minute 
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Duration**: until the next time you make your daily preparations

You mix blood, soil, and shadow together to form a half-real homunculus in the shape of a crow, sparrow, or other bird. You then command the bird to fly to a location within range and observe all around it. The bird has the statistics of a homunculus, save that it has all of your senses and shares your [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) modifier. Once the spell's duration elapses or upon a trigger you set (which must be fairly simpleâ€”"at dusk" or "when the judge leaves"), the bird flies to your location. If you wring its neck and drink its blood, you learn all that it saw since its creation.
