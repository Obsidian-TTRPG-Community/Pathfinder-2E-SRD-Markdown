# Feral Shades *Spell 2*   
[necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Traditions**: [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**30-foot cone
- **Saving Throw**  basic Fortitude

A wave of gray mist formed of negative energy spills out from your outstretched hand, briefly taking the shape of a pack of predatory animals that set viciously on your foes. You deal `2d4` slashing damage and `2d4` negative damage to creatures in the area. The shades set upon the vulnerable with greater ferocity: [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) creatures or those taking [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) take a â€“2 status penalty to the save.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The slashing damage and the negative damage each increase by `1d4`.
