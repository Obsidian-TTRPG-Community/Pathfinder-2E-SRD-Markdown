# Painful Suggestion Trap *Hazard 8*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 26 expert  

A [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) rune on the floor under the filth, just past the threshold, triggers an ersatz ghost.

- **Disable** DC 28 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (expert) to remove the rune without triggering it, or dispel magic (4th level; counteract DC 26) to dispel the rune.

title: **Counterfeit Haunting** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md), [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md), [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md), [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md), [mental](rules/traits/mental.md))

- **Trigger**: A living creature moves over the rune

**Effect** A frightful moan echoes through the room, and a hoarse telepathic voice shouts, "Get out!" This shout deals `6d12` mental damage to creatures in the room (DC 26 basic Will save). Creatures who fail this saving throw must immediately leave the room and can't willingly reenter it for 1 minute (1 hour on a critical failure).
