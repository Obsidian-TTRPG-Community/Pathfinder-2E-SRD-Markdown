# Banshee's Symphony *Hazard 18*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +30 legendary  

A magically contagious [wail of the banshee](compendium/spells/wail-of-the-banshee.md) spell is trapped in the larynx of an [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), mummified elf.

- **Disable** [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 42 (master) to pierce the [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) larynx so precisely that the magic releases in a trickle before the trap activates, [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 44 (legendary) three times to deconstruct the larynx while the trap is active in such a way that it tears the spell apart, or spell DC 38 (9th level) to counteract the wail of the banshee before the trap activates.  
     
```ad-embed-ability
title: Scream [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: Three or more living creatures remain within 100 feet of the trap for 6 seconds or longer.

**Effect** The trap releases an arcane wail of the banshee (DC 40) with a 100-foot-radius emanation instead of 40 feet, targeting all living creatures in the area, and rolls initiative.
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(1 action) The trap uses its action to force one random creature that failed its save against wail of the banshee last turn to emit a wail of the banshee with the same statistics as the initial one. The creature wails even if it is dead or unable to speak, no matter how far away from the trap it is. Unlike a casting of the spell, the [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) condition from this trap's [wail of the banshee](compendium/spells/wail-of-the-banshee.md) spells increases the targets' [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) condition values. A creature that critically succeeds at any of its saves can still be affected by the trap on future rounds, but can't be forced to wail by the trap.
```

**Reset** The trap ends when the trap is unable to make a creature scream (usually because no creature failed its save on the previous turn or because all creatures have critically succeeded in the past). It then resets over 24 hours, as a new scream builds up in the mummified larynx.
