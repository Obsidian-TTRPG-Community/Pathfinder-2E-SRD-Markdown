# Dragon Pillar *Hazard 6*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +0 or [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md)  

A 10-foot-tall wooden pole topped by a wooden carving of [Dahak](compendium/setting/deities/dahak-logm.md)'s head. Each dragon pillar's head has been treated with something to give it a distinct color, as indicated in the specific encounter, but regardless of color, plumes of smoke waft up from the mouth.

- **Disable** [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) DC 26 (expert) to push the pillar over, or [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 26 (expert) on the pillar to erase the magic runes that power it, or [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) (4th level; counteract DC 22) to dispel the pillar's magic.  
- **Perception** +16 [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md) 60 feet  

```ad-embed-ability
title: Recognize Ally

A dragon pillar can see through its empty eye sockets, and it can recognize Cinderclaws and their allies. A character disguised as a Cinderclaw can trick a dragon pillar into perceiving it as a Cinderclaw ally by using [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md). A dragon pillar always uses [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) for initiative.
```

- **AC** 24 , **Fort** +17, **Ref** +8
- **Hardness** 14, **HP** 56 (BT 28)
- **Immunities** critical hits; [fire](rules/traits/fire.md); object immunities; precision damage

title: Routine
(1 action) On its initiative, the dragon pillar fires an eye beam at the closest target within 120 feet.

```ad-inline-attack
title: Ranged [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") Eye Beam (20) ([divine](rules/traits/divine.md), [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md), range <120 feet>)
**Effects** The target is subjected to an effect determined by the pillar's color and summarized below. On a critical hit, the target's save result is one degree worse.

- **Black Eye Beam (area A5)** ([incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md)) DC 24 Fortitude save.  
  
    > [!success-degree]   
    > - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
    > - **Success** The target is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round.  
    > - **Failure** The target is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 hour.  
    > - **Critical Failure** The target is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 24 hours.
- **Blue Eye Beam (area A7)** ([incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md)) DC 24 Fortitude save.  
  
    > [!success-degree]   
    > - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
    > - **Success** The target is [petrified](rules/conditions.md#Petrified) for 1 round.  
    > - **Failure** The target is [petrified](rules/conditions.md#Petrified) for 1 hour.  
    > - **Critical Failure** The target is [petrified](rules/conditions.md#Petrified) permanently.
- **Green Eye Beam (area A8)** ([poison](rules/traits/poison.md)) `6d6` poison damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save).
- **Indigo Eye Beam (area A9)** ([incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md)) DC 24 Will save.  
  
    > [!success-degree]   
    > - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
    > - **Success** The target is [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 round.  
    > - **Failure** The target is [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused) for 1 hour.  
    > - **Critical Failure** The target is controlled by the dragon pillar and remains within 60 feet of it at all times, defending the dragon pillar from all non-Cinderclaws. While a target is controlled, it is treated as a Cinderclaw ally by the dragon pillar. The dragon pillar can control up to 3 targets at a time; any targets in excess who critically fail this saving throw are instead confused for `1d4+1` rounds. A controlled creature can attempt a new Will save once every 24 hours to escape control, but doing so automatically causes the dragon pillar to attack it with a new eye beam to attempt to re-establish control. The control ends if the pillar is destroyed.
- **Yellow Eye Beam (area A12)** ([electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md)) `6d6` electricity damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save).
- **Orange Eye Beam (area A15)** ([acid](rules/traits/acid.md)) `6d6` acid damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save).
- **Red Eye Beam (area A16)** ([fire](rules/traits/fire.md)) `6d6` fire damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save).
- **Violet Eye Beam (area A9)** ([incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md)) DC 24 Will save.  
  
    > [!success-degree]   
    > - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
    > - **Success** The target is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).  
    > - **Failure** The target is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).  
    > - **Critical Failure** The target is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
