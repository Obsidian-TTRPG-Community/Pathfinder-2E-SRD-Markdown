# Flying Guillotine *Hazard 5*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +10 trained or DC 23 (expert) to spot the glyph  

An [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) magical glyph on the guillotine's blade detects living creatures in the room, which causes the guillotine to fly off its hinges and attack.

- **Disable** DC 20 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (trained) to erase the glyph (which requires a successful unarmed attack roll if the blade is already active) or [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) (3rd level; counteract DC 20) to counteract it. The trap has a secret bypass known only to Ralso and Pratchett: as long as the guillotine can see a creature in the room touching thumb and pinky together with an empty hand, it remains dormant.  

- **AC** 23, **Fort** +9, **Ref** +17
- **Blade Hardness** 13, **Blade HP** 52 (BT 26)
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage

- **Trigger**: A living creature enters the room

**Effect** One round after a creature enters the room, the door to the room slams shut and locks (two DC 20 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) checks to pick), and the guillotine blade detaches from its housing and begins flying around the room as the trap rolls initiative.
