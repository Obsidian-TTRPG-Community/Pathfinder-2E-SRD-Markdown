# Dragonstorm *Hazard 18*

A massive storm stirs in the skies above Breachill and Citadel Altaerein. As specific events begin during the three waves of the manifestation's retribution, the dragonstorm wreaks localized havoc.

- **Disable** The dragonstorm can't be disabled—only endured. It ends only once the attack on Breachill and Citadel Altaerein is over.
