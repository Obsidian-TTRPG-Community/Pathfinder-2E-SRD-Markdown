title: Routine
(3 actions) The trap loses 1 action per turn per successful check to disable. The floating flamethrower uses its first action to release a gout of flame in a 15-foot cone that deals `4d6+4` fire damage (DC 40 basic Reflex save), its second action to fly in a U-shape in a random direction, and its third action to release another gout of flame.
