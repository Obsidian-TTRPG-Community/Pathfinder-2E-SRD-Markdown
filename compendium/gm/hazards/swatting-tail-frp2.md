# Swatting Tail *Hazard 18*  
[environmental](rules/traits/environmental.md)  [kaiju](rules/traits/kaiju-frp2.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 10  

Mogaru's tail sweeps forth, causing an arc of devastation in a 60-foot cone.

- **Disable** DC 45 [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) (legendary) or DC 48 [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) (legendary) to momentarily divert Mogaru's attention.

- **Trigger**: A creature takes a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action against Mogaru, produces a visible area effect, or flies within 120 feet of Mogaru

**Effect** Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 40 Reflex save or take `6d10+28` bludgeoning damage.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage and is pushed 20 feet away. If flying, it descends 20 feet.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage, is pushed 40 feet, and descends 60 feet (if flying) or is knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is pushed 60 feet away, descends 120 feet (if flying) or is knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone), and is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
```

**Reset** Mogaru doesn't swat his tail again for `1d4` rounds.
