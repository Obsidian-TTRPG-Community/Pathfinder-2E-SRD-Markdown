# Boulder Deadfall Trap *Hazard 7*  
[mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md)  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 25 trained DC 0 to spot the balanced boulders.  

A weight-sensitive plate buried underneath sand pulls a boulder over a cliff ledge, causing it to fall on targets within the entrance.

- **Disable** DC 27 [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) (expert) or DC 25 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (expert) to find and disconnect the plate from the tipping mechanism.

title: Deadfall [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature enters the area without taking care to avoid the [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) trigger plate

**Effect** Creatures within 10 feet of the cave entrance take `4d10+18` damage (DC 25 basic Reflex save).
```

**Reset** ting the boulders in the trap is a labor-intensive project that takes 2 hours.
