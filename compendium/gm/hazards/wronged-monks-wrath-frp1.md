- **Trigger**: A creature enters the prayer room

**Effect** The abbot's spirit appears and begins to channel powerful ki energy. One round later, the room fills with a powerful kinetic storm, dealing `3d10+15` electricity damage and `3d10+15` force damage to all creatures in the room. Creatures in the room must attempt a DC 37 Reflex save.

```

**Reset** The haunt re-forms after 1 hour. The haunt becomes disabled and doesn't re-form if a creature lights all of the candles in the room and offers a prayer to [Irori](compendium/setting/deities/irori.md).
