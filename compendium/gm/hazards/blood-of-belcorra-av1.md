- **Trigger**: A living creature ends its turn in area A11 at night

**Effect** A ghastly image of Belcorra, seemingly composed of fresh blood, rises from the bloodstain on the floor and rotates in place like a lighthouse. Beams of cold blue light shine from Belcorra's eyes and open mouth, causing blisters and decay to spread across flesh. Living creatures within a 30-foot burst from the center of area A11 must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. The haunt then rolls initiative.

**Reset** If the haunt is disabled or destroyed through damage, the bloody phantom of Belcorra sprays upward in a spiral, dousing the trap door leading to area A25 before draining upward through the keyhole, which reduces the [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC to [Pick the Lock](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md) to 20. At the next sunrise, the blood drains back down to this room and the haunt resets. The haunt is destroyed permanently once Lasda Venkervale is rescued from area D9.
