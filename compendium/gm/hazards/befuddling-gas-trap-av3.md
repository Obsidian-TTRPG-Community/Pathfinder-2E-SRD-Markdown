# Befuddling Gas Trap *Hazard 11*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +21 expert or DC 31 (expert) to notice the [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) override mechanism on the north wall.  

Seven nozzles [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) within holes in the 15-foot-high ceiling release a poison gas.

- **Disable** DC 33 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (master) to disable the [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) mechanism on the north wall, immediately sucking the gas from the room, or DC 29 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (expert) to adequately plug one of the seven nozzles. When all seven nozzles are plugged or destroyed, the trap is deactivated.  

- **AC** 31, **Fort** +24, **Ref** +18
- **Nozzle Hardness** 20, **Nozzle HP** 32 (BT 16)

- **Trigger**: Both secret doors are closed and at least one creature is in the room

**Effect** Gas fills the chamber. Creatures within the chamber must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or become [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) ([stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) on a critical failure). The trap then rolls initiative.

title: Routine

(1 action) The gas intensifies. Each creature in the room must make a DC 30 Fortitude save.
> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and becomes temporarily immune to the gas for 1 hour, though if the creature has already been [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) by the trap, that condition remains for its normal duration.
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature becomes [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 24 hours.
>
>    If the target is already [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied), the condition value increases by 1 (to a maximum of [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied)) and the target takes `8d6` mental damage.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, except the target takes double the mental damage.

**Reset** After an hour, the trap deactivates; the gas disperses slowly, and the doors can be opened again. After 24 hours, the gas builds up and the trap can be triggered again.
