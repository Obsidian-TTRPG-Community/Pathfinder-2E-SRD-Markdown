# Mana Whorl *Hazard 7*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [environmental](rules/traits/environmental.md "Environmental Hazard Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +14 trained to identify as dangerous quicksand; +20 (expert) to recognize its magical properties  

This 15-foot-wide patch of destabilized sand attempts to submerge creatures who wield magic. A desert tree with dense bright green foliage, pale pink blooms, and at least one carnivorous red-chested magpie is always nearby.

- **Disable** DC 26 [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) (expert) to feed magic into the whorl and temporarily stabilize it for a few minutes; feed the whorl a number of spellcasters and magic items with a combined 10 levels (for instance, a 4th-level cleric with two 3rd-level magic items) to stabilize it for 1 week; or feed the whorl a number of spellcasters and magic items with a combined 20 levels to stabilize it permanently.
Spellcasters and magic items fed to the whorl are devoured whole.  

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Submerge** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature who can cast spells, or who is wielding a magic item, walks into the mana whorl

**Effect** The triggering creature sinks into the whorl to its waist. The whorl rolls initiative if it hasn't already
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

(1 action) On its initiative, the whorl pulls down any creature within it that can cast spells or that is wielding a magic item. A creature submerged to the waist becomes submerged to the neck, and a creature submerged to the neck is pulled under and must hold its breath to avoid suffocation (Core Rulebook 478). If a creature has no spells or magic items, the mana whorl is merely difficult terrain.
A creature caught in a mana whorl can attempt a DC 23 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) to either raise itself by one step if submerged to the neck or worse, or to move 5 feet if submerged only to the waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down by one step. A creature that Swims out of the whorl escapes the hazard and is [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) in a space adjacent to the whorl. Other creatures can [Aid](rules/actions/aid.md) the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid, or attempt to pull the creature out with their own DC 23 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check. If a creature has only magic items and no ability to cast spells, dropping all the items releases that creature, and it can move through the mana whorl as normal difficult terrain.

**Reset** The hazard continues to suck in anyone with magic until it is satiated (see Disable above). Magpies leave any satiated whorls.
