```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(3 actions) The spirit cyclone uses 3 actions to move, traveling up to 30 feet with each action and dealing `2d10+13` negative damage to each creature in its path (DC 32 basic Reflex save). A creature needs to attempt only one save during the cyclone's movement, even if the cyclone moves over its space more than once. On a critical failure, a creature is swept up into the cyclone, becoming [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) ([Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) DC 32). A creature [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) by the cyclone moves along with the cyclone and takes `1d10+6` additional negative damage at their beginning of its turn, and it must attempt a Reflex save against the cyclone on the cyclone's turn, no matter where the cyclone moves. A creature that successfully Escapes from the cyclone falls from a height of 1d12 Ã— 5 feet.
