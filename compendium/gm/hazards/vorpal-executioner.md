- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 43 expert  

A wickedly sharp saw blade descends and travels along grooves in a complex path throughout the room, attempting to decapitate everyone within.

- **Disable** [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 41 (expert) at four different junctions to jam all the saw blade's possible paths, preventing it from traveling through the room.  

- **AC** 43, **Fort** +32, **Ref** +32
- **Hardness** 30, **HP** 120 (BT 60) per junction
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage

title: **Total Decapitation** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([attack](rules/traits/attack.md), [death](rules/traits/death.md))

- **Trigger**: A creature attempts to exit the room.

**Effect** The saw blade travels along its path, making one [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against each creature in the room, twisting and varying its height for a maximum chance of beheading its targets.
