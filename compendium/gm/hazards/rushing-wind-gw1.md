title: Routine

(1 action) The hazard uses its action to suck each creature (except the cairn wight) toward the aiudara. Each affected creature must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude save.
> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature is pulled 5 feet toward the aiudara and is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned). If the creature is already adjacent to the aiudara, it doesn't move but is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is pulled 10 feet toward the aiudara, falls [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone), and is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned). If the creature is already adjacent to the aiudara, it doesn't move but falls [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) and is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
