# Locking Door *Hazard -1*  
[haunt](rules/traits/haunt.md "Haunt Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 18 trained to notice the door sway slightly, even though there's no breeze  

A door (or other portal) slams shut and locks.

- **Disable** DC 14 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) to push back against the door, DC 14 [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) to wedge the door open, or DC 20 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (trained) to jam the lock or open the lock afterward  

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Shut In** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature ends their move after passing through the doorway

**Effect** With an ethereal gust shimmering in the air, the door creaks as it swings shut and locks. The haunted door pushes anyone in its space into an adjacent space in the connecting chamber. A creature that would be pushed and succeeds at a DC 16 Reflex save selects which side of the door they end up on.
