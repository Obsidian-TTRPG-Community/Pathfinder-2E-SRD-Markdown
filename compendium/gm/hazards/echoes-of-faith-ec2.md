title: **Phantom Sermon** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([divine](rules/traits/divine.md), [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md))

- **Trigger**: A non-Arodenite creature approaches within 5 feet of the lectern

**Effect** A spectral minister appears before the pulpit, resembling an ever-shifting amalgamation of several past priests. The spectral minister delivers fervent exhortations about faithlessness. Each creature on the dais must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or become [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained). On a critical failure, the creature is [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained).
