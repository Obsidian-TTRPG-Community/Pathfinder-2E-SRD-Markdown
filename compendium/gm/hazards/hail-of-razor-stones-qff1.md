```ad-embed-ability
title: **Deadfall** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature walks into the square containing the trip cord

**Effect** Falling rocks deal `4d8` slashing damage (DC 19 basic Reflex save) to any creature in the square, possibly pinning them to the ground.

On a failed save, the creature falls [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone); on a critical failure, the creature is [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) (DC 17 to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md)). An adjacent creature can attempt a DC 19 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to shove the rocks aside to free an [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) creature.
