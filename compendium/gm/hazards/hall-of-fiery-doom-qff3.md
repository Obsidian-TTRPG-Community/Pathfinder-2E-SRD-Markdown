While the roof is on fire and collapsing timbers crush those within the hall, demons fly down from the sky to pluck victims from the flames.

- **Disable** two DC 32 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) or [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks to douse the flames; [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) to do the work yourself or [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) to muster the ghostly soldiers. This reduces the hazard's actions by 1 and prevents it from using

Banish the demons with up to two DC 35 [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) checks; each success reduces the hazard's actions by 1, and two successes prevent it from using Demonic Abduction. When the hazard loses all 3 actions, Burning Timbers, and Demonic Abduction, it's disabled.

Creatures within the 30-foot by 90-foot area of the hall take `4d6+12` fire damage (DC 29 basic Reflex save).

```ad-embed-ability
title: Demonic Abduction [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

Spectral demons lift a single creature 50 feet into the air and drop it. The haunt makes a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the creature with a +23 attack bonus. On a success, the creature is lifted into the air and dropped, taking 25 bludgeoning damage, though it might negate some or all this damage using a spell, such as feather fall.

On a critical hit, the creature also takes `2d12+13` slashing damage as the demons' claws tear through its flesh.
