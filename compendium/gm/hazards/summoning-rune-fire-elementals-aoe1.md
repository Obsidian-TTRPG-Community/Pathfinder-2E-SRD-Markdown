# Summoning Rune (Fire Elementals) *Hazard 5*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +12 trained  

An invisible cloud of magical sensors detects living creatures in the room and summons fire elementals to slay the creatures.

- **Disable** DC 22 [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) (trained) to approach without triggering the trap, followed by DC 22 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (trained) to erase the rune or dispel magic (3rd level; counteract DC 20) to counteract the rune.

title: **Summon Elementals** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md), summon)

- **Trigger**: A living creature enters the room

**Effect** Two rounds after a creature enters the room, the room's door slams shut and locks (two DC 20 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) checks to pick), and two cinder rat fire elementals emerge from the floor. The elementals roll initiative and remain for `3d6` rounds, after which the spell ends and the creatures disappear. The elementals also disappear if someone disables the trap before the duration expires. The summoned elementals can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures.
