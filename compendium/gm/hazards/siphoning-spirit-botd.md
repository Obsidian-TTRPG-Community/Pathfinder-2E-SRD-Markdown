# Siphoning Spirit *Hazard 19*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [haunt](rules/traits/haunt.md "Haunt Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +40 trained  

A formless spirit drains life from the living, becoming progressively visible as its victims weaken.

- **Disable** DC 48 [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) (expert) to weaken the spirit; four total successes are required to disable the haunt

- **Trigger**: A living creature passes within 15 feet of the spirit

**Effect** The [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) spirit latches onto the life essence of the living, dealing `4d10+20` negative damage to all living creatures within 60 feet (DC 41 basic Fortitude save). The haunt then rolls initiative

title: Routine

(1 action; [death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait"), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait"), [negative](rules/traits/negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait")) The spirit inhales, siphoning the souls of the living and becoming more visible. Each creature within 60 feet takes `4d10+20` negative damage, with a DC 41 Fortitude save. If no creatures are within the area, the haunt moves up to 120 feet into the largest concentration of living creatures and then inhales.

> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and increases its [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) value by 1, to a maximum of [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and increases its [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) value by 2, to a maximum of [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained). If the creature was already [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained), it dies.

**Reset** After 1 minute, the spirit is satiated, and the haunt deactivates as it returns to a resting state. Over the course of 1 hour, the spirit's siphoned life energy disperses and the haunt resets.
