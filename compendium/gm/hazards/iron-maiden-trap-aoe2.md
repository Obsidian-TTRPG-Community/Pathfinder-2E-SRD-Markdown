# Iron Maiden Trap *Hazard 8*  
[mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 30 expert  

A pressure plate [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) on the floor before an iron maiden causes the torture device to snap shut and trap the triggering creature inside.

- **Disable** DC 28 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) to disable the pressure plate.  

- **AC** 25, **Fort** +0, **Ref** +0

title: **Slam Shut** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature steps onto the trap's pressure plate (indicated on the map)

**Effect** The front of the iron maiden slams shut with incredible force and locks itself. The triggering creature takes `4d10+10` piercing damage and `2d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) (DC 26 basic Reflex save; if the creature critically succeeds, they avoid the trap completely). The triggering creature is also [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized). The victim can end their immobilization only once a creature outside the iron maiden unlocks the device (requiring two successful DC 28 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) checks.
```

```

**Reset** The pressure plate must be reset manually.
