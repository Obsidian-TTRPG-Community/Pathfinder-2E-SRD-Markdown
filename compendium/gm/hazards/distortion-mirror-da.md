title: Painful Transformation [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[attack](rules/traits/attack.md "Attack Combat Trait")  

- **Trigger**: A creature is reflected in the mirror

**Effect** The triggering creature's body is painfully squished, stretched, and distorted to match their reflection. The creature takes `6d10+30` force damage and must attempt a DC 39 Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes half damage and is [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The target takes full damage and is [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 4 rounds.
> - **Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 minute. As long as the creature is [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) or [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled), it additionally takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.
>
>    When the effects of this trap end, the triggering creature's transformation ends, and its body reverts to its natural form.
