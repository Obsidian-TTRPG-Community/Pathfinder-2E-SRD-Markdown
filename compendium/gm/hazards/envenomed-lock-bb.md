When a creature tries to unlock or [Pick the Lock](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md), a spine extends to attack that creature. The trap makes a melee attack with +13 to its attack roll. On a hit, it deals 1 piercing damage and `1d6` [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) (on a critical hit, 2 piercing damage and `2d6` [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage)).
