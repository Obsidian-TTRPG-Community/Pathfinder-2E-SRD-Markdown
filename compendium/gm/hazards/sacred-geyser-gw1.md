# Sacred Geyser *Hazard 3*  
[environmental](rules/traits/environmental.md "Environmental Hazard Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 19 trained  

A geyser of boiling water erupts at any character who attempts to take water from the oasis.

- **Disable** DC 21 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (trained) to concoct a mechanism for indirectly harvesting the water from a safe distance

title: **Boiling Geyser** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature dips a vessel or otherwise attempts to remove water from the oasis

**Effect** A jet of magical boiling water targets the triggering creature and affects all creatures within 5 feet of the target. Creatures caught in the burst take `2d10+13` fire damage (basic DC 23 Reflex save).
```

**Reset** The geyser resets automatically and adapts to previous circumvention, requiring a new check to disable it each time.
