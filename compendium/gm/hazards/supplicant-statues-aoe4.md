# Supplicant Statues *Hazard 14*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +30 master  

Six statues rapidly slide around the room on rollers, slowing down intruders and striking at them with spring-loaded sword arms.

- **Disable** DC 34 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (master) to disable a specific statue's rollers, or DC 39 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (master) on the control panel in A4 deactivates the whole trap. For each statue disabled, the trap loses 1 action from its routine and the DC for its predictive impediment ability decreases by 4. Dispel magic (7th level, counteract DC 32) doesn't harm the statues but removes the predictive impediment ability. Breaking the control panel prevents the trap from resetting.  

- **AC** 34, **Fort** +20, **Ref** +28
- **HP** 20 (BT 10); **Statue Hardness** 22, **Statue HP** 96 (BT 48)

- **Trigger**: A creature enters a square adjacent to a statue

**Effect** The trap makes a statue shortsword [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the triggering creature, activates its predictive impediment ability, and then rolls initiative.

The statues continually slide around to bump into creatures and block their passage through the room. The first time on its turn that a creature attempts to move within the room, it must succeed at a DC 36 Reflex save or treat the entire room as difficult terrain for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is also knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).

title: Routine

(6 actions) On the trap's initiative, each functioning statue slides up to 40 feet around the room and makes a statue shortsword [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against an adjacent creature. The trap doesn't take a multiple attack penalty, and the statues' movements don't trigger reactions.

**Reset** The trap deactivates and resets one minute after the room is empty.
