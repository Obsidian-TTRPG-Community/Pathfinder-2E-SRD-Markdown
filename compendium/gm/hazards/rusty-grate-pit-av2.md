# Rusty Grate Pit *Hazard 6*  
[mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 0  

The rusty grate covers a pit that's 10 feet in diameter and 40 feet deep.

- **Disable** DC 18 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) to harmlessly trigger the trap by nudging the gate or the dangling winch, or DC 24 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) to stabilize the grate so it doesn't collapse.  

- **AC** 21, **Fort** +17, **Ref** +11
- **Hardness** 14, **HP** 56 (BT 28)
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Pitfall** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature walks onto the grate

**Effect** The triggering creature falls in and takes falling damage (20 bludgeoning damage). That creature can use the [Grab an Edge](rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md) reaction to avoid falling. Whether or not the creature Grabs an Edge, the rusty winch above crashes down atop the triggering creature, dealing `3d10` bludgeoning damage and dislodging its grip (DC 24 basic Reflex save). The creature can still try to [Grab an Edge](rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md) again.
