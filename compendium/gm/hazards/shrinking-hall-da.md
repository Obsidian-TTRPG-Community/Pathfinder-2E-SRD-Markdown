# Shrinking Hall *Hazard 2*  
[mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 18  

This hallway is designed to shrink as creatures traverse it, making access to the door at the hall's end impossible.

- **Disable** DC 21 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (trained) to jam the scales built into the floor  

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Shrink** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: 100 pounds of weight or more is placed on the hallway's floor

**Effect** The hall's last 40 feet of walls angle inward, causing the hall to shrink and contract down, reaching 6 inches in height and width at the hall's far end and completely blocking access to the hall's exit door for anything but a Tiny creature Squeezing.
```

**Reset** After 10 minutes without weight being placed on this hall's floor, this trap resets, returning the hall to its original size.
