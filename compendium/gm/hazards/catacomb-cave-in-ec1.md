title: **Falling Stones** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A Medium or larger creature approaches within 5 feet of the collapsed tunnel

**Effect** Massive stones in the ceiling fall, dealing `4d6` bludgeoning damage to the triggering creature and all creatures within 10 feet (DC 18 basic Reflex save).

A buried creature can attempt a DC 20 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check every round, breaking free on a success. Other characters who are not buried can [Aid](rules/actions/aid.md) on this check.
