# Etward's Nightmare *Hazard 9*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [haunt](rules/traits/haunt.md "Haunt Hazard Trait")  [unique](rules/traits/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +30 master  

The incense burners begin to smoke, filling the air with strangely nostalgic scents.

- **Disable** DC 26 [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) (expert) to enter a state akin to lucid dreaming so as to unweave the nightmare from within, or DC 30 [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) (master) to stand resolute against the nightmares and turn the fear back upon itself

- **Trigger**: A creature lies down on the bed, or a living creature spends more than 3 rounds inside this room

**Effect** Incense swiftly fills the room (even if the incense burners have been removed or were destroyed). All creatures in area A12 must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save. The haunt then rolls initiative.

> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) by the incense's scent.
> - **Failure** The creature falls [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). If it's still [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) after 1 minute, it wakes up automatically.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but if it's still [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) after 1 hour, it wakes up automatically.

title: DC 28

Fortitude saving throw. If at the end of the round there are no [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) creatures in the room, Etward's nightmare ends and the trap deactivates.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and wakes up.
> - **Success** The creature remains [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and takes `1d10` cold damage and `1d10` mental damage. This damage does not wake the creature, and those who are awake can see the [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) creature thrash as if in the throes of a nightmare while their body rimes over with layers of frost. The creature can fight against the bitter cold and monstrous shapes by attempting a DC 28 Will save as a three-action activity on its turn— on a success, the creature wakes up.
> - **Failure** As success, but `1d10+6` cold and `1d10+6` mental damage, and with a DC 32 Will save to wake up.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature remains [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and takes `2d10+12` cold damage and `2d10+12` mental damage.

title: Routine
(2 actions; cold, enchantment, mental, occult) The haunt uses its first action to light incense burners again, forcing any creature that isn't already [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) to save against that effect once more. Its second action is to cause any [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) creatures in the room to experience horrific, vivid dreams about being lost in the arctic during a blizzard, while enormous furred figures— saumen kar—lunge at them through the snow to attack repeatedly. Each [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) creature must attempt a

**Reset** The hazard resets when Etward dreams in this room.
