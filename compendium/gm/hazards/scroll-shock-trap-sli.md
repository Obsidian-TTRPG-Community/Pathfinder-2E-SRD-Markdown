- **Trigger**: A creature without an Aspis Consortium badge approaches within 5 feet of a slab

**Effect** Both double doors leading out of the room shut and lock. While the trap is active, the doors must be battered open (Hardness 18; Panel HP 72 [BT 36]; [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) DC 29 to [Force Open](rules/actions/force-open.md)). The closest symbol to the triggering creature shoots an electricity bolt attack at it. The trap then rolls initiative.
