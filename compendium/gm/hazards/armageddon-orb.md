# Armageddon Orb *Hazard 23*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 10 or [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md).  

A roiling red orb, forged from a drop of the god Rovagug's blood, rains fire from the sky when a specified condition is met.

- **Disable** [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 48 (legendary) to imbue thieves' tools with aspects representing Asmodeus and Sarenrae and use them to drain away the orb's power over 10 minutes; the character attempting this check takes 5 fire damage each round until the orb is depleted.

[death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait")  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Trigger**: A special condition set by the trap's creator occurs; this is typically the event of their death.

**Effect** Fire rains from the sky in a 100-mile radius, dealing `10d6` fire damage to creatures and objects in the area. Each creature or object can attempt a DC 46 basic Reflex save. Any creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage dies instantly. This is not enough damage to completely burn away a forest or level an entire mountain or city, but it typically kills most creatures in the area.
