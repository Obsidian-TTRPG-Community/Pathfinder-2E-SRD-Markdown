# Magic Starknives Trap *Hazard 5*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** DC 22 [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check to spot the magical energies reverberating in the pillars  

Starknife symbols on the six pillars glow and shoot across the room.

- **Disable** DC 21 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (expert) or [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) on any four of the six pillars disables the entire trap (the trap is a 2nd-level spell and the DC to dispel it is 21). Destroying any four of the six pillars also disables the trap.  

- **AC** 22, **Fort** +15, **Ref** +9
- **Pillar Hardness** 12, **Pillar HP** 14 (BT 7)
- **Immunities** critical hits; sneak attack

If a creature passes the middle pair of pillars, both doors leading out of the room slam shut and lock; while the trap is active, the doors must be battered open with a successful DC 23 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check or sufficient damage (Hardness 12; HP 48 [BT 24]). One of the starknife carvings glows with light, detaches from the pillar, and then flies outward, making a magical starknife Ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a random creature within range. The trap then rolls initiative with its [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) modifier of +12.

(3 actions) For each of its actions on its turn, a carving on a different pillar glows and makes a magical starknife Ranged Strike against a random creature within range. Creatures might have cover from this Strike, such as from one of the pillars in the room.
