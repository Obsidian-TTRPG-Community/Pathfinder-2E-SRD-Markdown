# Treacherous Scree *Hazard 3*  
[environmental](rules/traits/environmental.md "Environmental Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 23 trained  

The footing on this sloped ground appears to be stable at first glance, but the tiny rocks that cover it are loosely packed and [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) to slipping.

- **Disable** DC 20 [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) (trained) to navigate a safe path  

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Rockslide** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature steps on the unstable ground

**Effect** Rocks tumble and slip beneath its feet. The triggering creature must attempt a DC 21 Reflex save as they tumble against the rocks, which deal `2d10+13` bludgeoning damage.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage and falls [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) in its space.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage, falls [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) in its space, and tumbles down to the bottom of the slope.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but double damage.
