# Lesser Dragonstorm *Hazard 20*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md)  [environmental](rules/traits/environmental.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +38 legendary  

A small-scale version of a dragonstorm—a churning vortex of wind infused with fire, acid, lightning, poison, and ice—fills [Alseta](compendium/setting/deities/alseta-logm.md)'s Ring.

- **Disable** [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) DC 40 (legendary) to call out to a non-evil deity for direct intervention to disperse the lesser dragonstorm (prayers to [Apsu](compendium/setting/deities/apsu-logm.md) allow characters who are masters in [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) to attempt the check as if they were legendary instead), [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 42 (legendary) to deactivate Vengegate while the manifestation is forcing it open, or a successful [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) (10th level; DC 40) to counteract the lesser dragonstorm.

title: Manifest Lesser Dragonstorm [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature attempts to activate Vengegate

**Effect** The chamber within [Alseta](compendium/setting/deities/alseta-logm.md)'s Ring fills with a dragonstorm. Creatures within this area take `10d8` damage, equally split between acid, cold, electricity, fire, and poison.
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(1 action) On its initiative, the lesser dragonstorm reaches out and blasts all creatures within [Alseta](compendium/setting/deities/alseta-logm.md)'s Ring. Affected creatures take `10d8` damage (DC 46 basic Reflex save), evenly split between acid, cold, fire, electricity, and poison. Creatures that fail their save are pulled 20 feet toward the center of [Alseta](compendium/setting/deities/alseta-logm.md)'s Ring (or are knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) and pulled 30 feet on a critical failure). After 10 rounds, the lesser dragonstorm is destroyed, but a much greater dragonstorm manifests in the surrounding region—see The Dragonstorm on page 7.
