# Tree Of Dreadful Dreams *Hazard 10*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +22 expert  

The statue of the willow tree animates, its branches lashing out to try to grab anyone in area **B2**.

- **Disable** [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) or [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 25 (trained) to force or lever open a single branch, disabling that branch and freeing any creature trapped within. [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 29 (expert) to disrupt the tree's magical animation, shut it down, and free all trapped creatures. Placing a [dreamstone](compendium/equipment/items/dreamstone-aoa3.md) in the tree's trunk takes 2 [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions and causes the trap to shut down, freeing all trapped creatures. Placing the [cursed dreamstone](compendium/equipment/items/dreamstone-cursed-aoa3.md) from area **B4** in the trunk instead increases the tree's actions per turn to 4 and gives it a +2 item bonus to all saving throws and attack rolls.  

- **AC** 30 , **Fort** +22, **Ref** +14
- **Branch Hardness** 10, **Branch HP** 40 (BT 20) to break each branch
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage
- **Resistances** 
- **Weaknesses**

title: Routine
(3 actions) The statue uses each action to attempt a branch [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a random creature in the room that it hasn't [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed). If there are no creatures for it to attack and it has at least one creature [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), it instead Constricts. The trap can have up to six creatures [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed).

`1d10+12` bludgeoning, DC 27.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: Terrifying Visions

A creature that begins its turn [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) by the trap experiences vivid, warped visions of true events and must succeed at a DC 31 Will save or take `4d8` mental damage. On a critical failure, the creature also becomes [doomed](rules/conditions.md#Doomed). A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
```

**Reset** The trap deactivates and resets if it has no creatures [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) and no creatures in the room to attack. If an uncursed [dreamstone](compendium/equipment/items/dreamstone-aoa3.md) is placed in its trunk, the statue doesn't reactivate.
