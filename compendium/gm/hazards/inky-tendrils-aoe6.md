Six giant tentacles reach up from the ink lake, grabbing any foes in reach and dragging them underwater.

- **Disable** DC 48 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) (legendary) or DC 45 [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) (master) to tie one tentacle into a knot, rendering it useless, or dispel magic (8th level; counteract DC 44) to counteract one tentacle. The death of the Daemonic Rumormonger permanently dispels all the inky tendrils.  

- **AC** 42 , **Fort** +36, **Ref** +39
- **Tentacle Hardness** 5, **Tentacle HP** 80 (BT 40)
