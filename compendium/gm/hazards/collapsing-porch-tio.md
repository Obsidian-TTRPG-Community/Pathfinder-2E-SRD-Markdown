title: Collapse [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

If a creature walks on the area marked on the map, it falls through the weakened floorboards onto uneven rocks and sharp shards of wood, taking `1d4` piercing damage and `1d6` bludgeoning damage. The creature can use the [Grab an Edge](rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md) reaction to avoid the fall and the damage.
```

**Reset** Once this section of the porch has collapsed, creatures can still fall through the hole until the porch is [Repaired](rules/actions/repair.md).
