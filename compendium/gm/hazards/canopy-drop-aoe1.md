# Canopy Drop *Hazard 4*  
[mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 25 expert  

A trapdoor, connected to floor sensors, opens in the section of floor marked on the map, while the surrounding floor suddenly tilts to a 45-degree angle and the fountains in the wall begin spraying at high pressure, making the tile slippery and pushing creatures toward the open chute.

- **Disable** DC 23 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (expert) to jam the mechanisms and keep the trapdoor from opening, or to locate the bypass switch [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) under a stair riser just outside the room.  

- **AC** 20, **Fort** +13, **Ref** +8
- **Trapdoor Hardness** 10, **Trapdoor HP** 40 (BT 20)

title: **Flush** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: Two or more creatures stand on the trapped spaces

**Effect** One round after the trap is triggered, all creatures in the room fall 40 feet down the shaft to area E36, taking 20 bludgeoning damage from the fall plus `2d6` piercing damage as they land in the spiked pit. The creatures can [Grab an Edge](rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md) to snag the hammock or one of the hanging storage containers to avoid falling. The DC to [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md) the walls or [Grab an Edge](rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md) is 20.
