- **Disable** [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 29 (master) to carefully fracture the crystals or [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) DC 27 (expert) to place objects to stop the resonance, both disabling one 5-foot patch of crystals.  

- **AC** 34 , **Fort** +26, **Ref** +18
- **Hardness** 18, **HP** 72 (BT 36) per 5-foot patch

- **Trigger**: A living creature approaches within 20 feet of a wailing crystal.

**Effect** A despairing chorus of cries echoes off the crystals, working its way into the minds of all living creatures in Jewelgate Way Station, affecting them with [crushing despair](compendium/spells/crushing-despair.md) (7th level, DC 33). The hazard rolls initiative.

(3 actions) The hazard uses each action for an Anguished Shriek. The wailing crystals lose 1 action for each 5-foot patch of crystals that is [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) or destroyed.

A shrieking, distorted face composed of writhing necromantic energy lances out of the crystals to target a random living creature within 20 feet. The target takes `4d6` mental damage and `4d6` sonic damage (DC 33 basic Will save).
