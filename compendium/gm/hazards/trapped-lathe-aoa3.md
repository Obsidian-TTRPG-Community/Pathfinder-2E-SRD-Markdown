- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +19 expert DC 29 to notice the line of cord running from the lathe's trigger toward the door to area **A2**.  

The powered lathe's springs have been critically overwound so that when jostled or triggered, the lathe unwinds violently, hurling blades, gears, and sharp shards of metal around the room.

- **Disable** [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 31 (expert) on the lathe releases the tension on its springs without unleashing its blades and gears.  

- **AC** 30, **Fort** +22, **Ref** +14
- **Hardness** 18, **HP** 72 (BT 36)
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage

(4 actions) The lathe attempts four sharpened fragment attacks against creatures in the room, selecting a target randomly from all available targets in area **A1**. The trap does not take multiple attack penalties for any of its attacks. The trap loses 1 action each turn as its springs wind down, and becomes disabled when it has 0 actions.
