# Ghostly Choir *Hazard 6*  
[haunt](rules/traits/haunt.md "Haunt Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 20 expert  

A choir of lost souls rises out of the floor, singing an eerie chant that terrifies its listeners and buffets their bodies with walls of sound.

- **Disable** DC 28 [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) (trained) to disrupt the song's resonance with another tune or DC 28 [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) (trained) to ritually silence the spirits  

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Profane Chant** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md), [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md), [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md), [fear](rules/traits/fear.md), [mental](rules/traits/mental.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md))

- **Trigger**: A creature moves within 10 feet of the section of floor from which the choir can arise

**Effect** The choir rises, and its song deals `4d8+18` mental damage to non-evil creatures within 30 feet of the souls' spectral forms.

Affected creatures must each attempt a DC 24 Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage. It also becomes [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) and [fleeing](rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) for 1 round.
