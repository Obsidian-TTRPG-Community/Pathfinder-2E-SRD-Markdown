# Haunted Aiudara *Hazard 6*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [haunt](rules/traits/haunt.md "Haunt Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +15 expert  

The spiritual imprints of long-dead explorers haunt this aiudara, manifesting as a trio of astral wraiths who guard the gateway jealously.

- **Disable** DC 25 [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) (trained) to exorcise one of the wraiths or DC 25 [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) (expert) to erase one of the wraith's astral sigils; three successful checks are required to disable the haunt

- **Trigger**: A creature comes within 30 feet of the aiudara

**Effect** Three aiudara wraiths screech in unison and manifest to protect the arch. Each creature within 30 feet must attempt a DC 27 Will save. The haunt rolls initiative.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature takes `2d8+9` force damage.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes `4d8+9` force damage and is [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued).

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

(3 actions; conjuration, divine, teleportation) With spectral claws, the aiudara wraiths hurl trespassers through time and space. Each of the three wraiths has 1 action which it can use to make a forceful hand [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a creature within 60 feet. The haunt loses 1 action for each successful check to disable the haunt.
When the haunt rolls a critical hit to [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) a creature, the creature is instantly shunted to an empty space within 30 feet. The haunt chooses which space the creature is transported to.

**Reset** The aiudara wraiths disperse after 1 minute, but the haunt resets after 24 hours.
