# Mukradi Summoning Runes *Hazard 15*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +25 master to notice runes marked on the floor.  

Barely visible runes are etched into the stone floor in a 20-foot diameter circle.

- **Disable** DC 36 [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) to approach without triggering the trap followed by DC 34 [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) (expert) or DC 38 Thievery(master) to erase the rune, or dispel magic (8th level; counteract DC 34) to counteract the rune..

title: **Summon Monster** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md), summon)

- **Trigger**: A creature enters the circle without uttering the passphrase, "Praise to the Water Lizard"

**Effect** The trap summons a mukradi (Bestiary 239). The mukradi rolls initiative and remains for 1 minute, after which the spell ends and the mukradi disappears. The mukradi also disappears if someone disables the trap before the duration expires. The mukradi can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures.
