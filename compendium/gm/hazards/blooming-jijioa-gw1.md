title: **Solar Bloom** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: The jijioa patch is exposed to a solar flare

**Effect** The countless jijioa flowers suddenly bloom, magnifying the ambient heat of the sun a hundredfold.

Creatures in the jijioa patch take `4d6` fire damage (DC 22 basic Fortitude save). Creatures that end their turn in the patch continue to take damage in this way as long as the jijioa is in bloom.
```

**Reset** An hour after blooming, a jijioa patch goes dormant for 1 week.
