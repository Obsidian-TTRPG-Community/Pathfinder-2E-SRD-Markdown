# Paralyzing Light Trap *Hazard 8*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** DC 18 expert  

When any creature other than a devil enters the light, the magic interwoven in the light holds the creature in place and rings an alarm.

- **Disable** DC 26 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (master) to distort or diffuse the light, keeping the light cone intact but preventing the trap from triggering, or dispel magic (4th level; counteract DC 26) to dispel the light, leaving the room in darkness.

- **Trigger**: A non-devil creature moves into the light

**Effect** The light expands to fill the room, and each nondevil creature within the room must attempt a DC 26 Will save. A high-pitched chime sounds in the barracks (area D15), audible in this room as well. The trap then rolls initiative.

> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
> - **Failure** The target is [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 round.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for `1d4` rounds and [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 round.

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(1 action) All [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) and [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) creatures in the room take `1d10` mental damage (DC 26 basic Will save). Creatures who fail also become [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 round but can use a reaction to mentally fight off this stasis; creatures who do so take `5d10` mental damage but are no longer [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed).

**Reset** The stasis magic in the light builds up over the course of an hour, after which the trap can trigger again.
