# Eternal Flame *Hazard 7*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md)  [haunt](rules/traits/haunt.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +18 expert  

A raging spectral inferno arises out of thin air, strengthening all undead creatures within its area. This haunt most often arises from the charred remains of a group of three people who burned to death, whether in a terrible accident or a deliberate execution, and their unavenged souls burn with rage.

- **Disable** DC 27 [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) (expert) to temporarily calm the rage of one of the three spirits, or DC 30 [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) (trained) to exorcise one of the spirits; three total successes are required to disable the haunt

- **Trigger**: A living creature approaches within 10 feet of the remains of a victim of the original fire

**Effect** Memories of the pain suffered by the fire's past victims assault the triggering creature's mind. The creature must attempt a DC 25 Will save, and the haunt then rolls initiative.

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(1 action) Phantom flames rage across the haunted area, dealing `4d6` fire damage to each living creature within the area (DC 23 basic Will save). Undead creatures in the area are infused with flames for the following round.

They gain the [fire](rules/traits/fire.md) trait and immunity to fire, and all their attacks deal an additional `1d6` fire damage. Objects in the area are unaffected.
```
^routine

**Reset** The flames cease 1 minute after all living creatures leave the area, but after 1 hour, the anger and pain simmer up and the haunt is ready to trigger again.
