# Serpent Ward *Hazard 7*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 25 expert  

Illusionary snakes erupt from the trapped door, inflicting a venomous curse on intruders.

- **Disable** DC 26 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (expert) or DC 24 [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) (expert) to deactivate the magical trigger.  

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Curse the Intruders** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([curse](rules/traits/curse.md), [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md))

- **Trigger**: The trapped door is opened other than by a serpentfolk

**Effect** Hissing, illusionary snakes leap from the door. Each living creature within 30 feet is subjected to the curse of potent poison. If a living creature opened the door, that creature must roll its saving throw against the curse twice and take the worse result (this is a [misfortune](rules/traits/misfortune.md "Misfortune Effect Trait") effect).
