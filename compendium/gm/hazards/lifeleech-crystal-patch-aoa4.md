- **Complexity** Simple

- **AC** 31, **Fort** +24, **Ref** +12
- **Hardness** 20, **HP** 80 (BT 40)

- **Trigger**: A creature with blood moves through a patch of lifeleech crystals.

**Effect** The crystals twist and slash, animating and cutting into the creature as it walks, dealing `5d8` slashing damage. The creature must attempt a DC 28 Reflex saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes full damage and is [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained).
> - **Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained).
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, plus the creature's blood causes fresh growth. A new 10-foot-square patch of lifeleech crystals grows in an adjacent space to the current patch of crystals.
