[mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple

A chair on [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) tracks surges forward, knocking a creature into the chair's seat and trapping them in place with clamping armrests.

- **Disable** DC 23 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (expert) to disrupt the tracks  

- **AC** 22, **Fort** +15, **Ref** +9
- **Hardness** 14, **HP** 54 (BT 27)
- **Immunities** object immunities

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Take a Seat!** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature steps on the track

**Effect** The chair rockets forward along the track and slams into the triggering creature, dealing `3d8+15` bludgeoning damage. A creature who succeeds at a DC 22 Reflex save takes no damage and moves out of the chair's path into a random adjacent square not containing the track.

A creature who fails this saving throw is knocked into the chair's seat and immediately captured by the armrests, becoming [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) ([restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) on a critical failure; [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) DC 26).
```

**Reset** The trap resets automatically over 2 rounds if the chair is unoccupied.
