title: **Whirling Blades** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: Three or more creatures enter the area of the haunt; Effect sharp fragments lift up from the ground and begin to spin in rapid circles taking up one 5-foot square. The haunt rolls initiative.

**Effect**
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

(3 actions) The tornado of blades uses 3 actions to move, traveling up to 30 feet with each action and dealing `2d10+10` slashing damage. Each creature in its path must attempt a DC 33 Reflex save.
> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage plus `1d10` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and `1d10` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). It also becomes [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) (or increases its [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) value by 1, if it is already [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded)). Each successful check to disable this hazard reduces the haunt's movement by 30 feet, and the fourth success disables it completely.
```

**Reset** The haunt draws jagged shards back into its area over the course of an hour, after which it can trigger again.
