# Boiling Tub Trap *Hazard 13*  
[mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 37 master  

A snapped trip wire causes an alchemical bomb to detonate and blow up part of the tin tub, spilling boiling water all over the trap's victim.

- **Disable** DC 32 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (master) to safely remove the trip wire from the bomb.

title: **Overflowing Boiling Water** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: The trip wire is pulled or severed

**Effect** An acid flask detonates, spraying acid at nearby creatures and causing the tub of boiling water to burst in the same direction. All creatures in a 5-foot cone east of the triggered boiling tub trap take `3d6` [persistent acid damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), 3 acid [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage, and `8d6+20` fire damage (DC 31 basic Reflex save).
