# Freezing Alarm *Hazard 20*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 43 master  

Miniature snowflake-shaped glyphs on the ground cause a layer of ice to ripple over the floor of the room and sound a silent alarm.

- **Disable** DC 51 [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) (legendary) to draw a fiery counteracting glyph over each snowflake, or dispel magic (9th level, counteract DC 48)

title: **Freeze Floor** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md), [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [cold](rules/traits/cold.md))

- **Trigger**: A creature enters one of the three squares marked with a T on the map

**Effect** The floor of the entire 10-foot-by-15-foot antechamber freezes over, sending deadly magical frost creeping up the legs of the intruders. Any creatures standing in the room must roll a DC 45 Reflex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes `3d10+5` cold damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes `6d10+10` cold damage and is [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for `1d4` rounds.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes `12d10+20` cold damage and is [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 minute. Additionally, the golems in area B10 become aware of the intruders. The golems activate and come to this room to attack, if they haven't been destroyed already.
