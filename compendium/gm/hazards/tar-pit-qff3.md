```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

(1 action) On its initiative, the tar pit pulls down each creature within it, thick tar adhering to the creature's body. A creature that was submerged up to its waist becomes submerged up to its neck, and a creature that was submerged up to its neck is pulled under and must hold its breath to avoid suffocation.
A creature in the tar pit can attempt a DC 33 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md) to either raise itself by one step (if it's submerged to its neck or full submerged) or to move 5 feet if it's submerged only up to its waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down one step. Other creatures can [Aid](rules/actions/aid.md) the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid or by attempting to pull the creature out with their own DC 33 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check. In addition to the usual results, a character adjacent to the tar pit who critically fails while Aiding moves into the tar pit. A creature that Climbs out of the tar pit escapes the hazard and lands [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) in an adjacent space.

**Reset** Though the hazard still captures anyone who touches it, the surface doesn't become [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) again until it settles, which takes 24 hours.
