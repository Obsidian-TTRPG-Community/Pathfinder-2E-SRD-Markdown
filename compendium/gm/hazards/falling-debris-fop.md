- **Trigger**: Pressure is placed on the floorboard.

**Effect** The ceiling in the crawlway collapses in the square where the passage turns, and also in the two adjacent squares. Anyone in these three squares takes `3d6` bludgeoning damage and can attempt a DC 14 Reflex save to reduce the damage. For the creature in the center square, where the trap is triggered, this is a basic save. Creatures in the two adjacent squares take no damage on a success or critical success as they avoid the falling debris entirely, but take full damage on a failed save, and take double damage on a critical failure. Creatures that take damage from the debris are [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), trapped under the crushing weight. Clearing out a square of debris requires a successful DC 17 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill check, with the following effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The square is cleared in 1 minute.
> - **Success** The square is cleared in 5 minutes.
> - **Failure** The square is cleared in 10 minutes.
> - **Critical Failure** The ceiling above the square collapses further, dealing an additional `2d6` to the character digging out the square and any character trapped in that square. This takes 1 minute and no progress is made.
