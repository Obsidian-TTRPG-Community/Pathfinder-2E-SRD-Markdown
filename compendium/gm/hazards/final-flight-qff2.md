# Final Flight *Hazard 5*  
[haunt](rules/traits/haunt.md "Haunt Hazard Trait")  [unique](rules/traits/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 26 expert  

A creature experiences the death of a priest carried off by griffons and fed to their chicks.

- **Disable** DC 22 [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) (trained) to soothe the restless spirits, or DC 24 [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) (trained) to recite a prayer honoring the deceased; two successful checks are required to disable the haunt

title: **Final Flight** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md), [mental](rules/traits/mental.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md))

- **Trigger**: A creature enters the gathering circle

**Effect** The triggering creature experiences the last moments of the priest who once tended the Lea of Honored Souls. Griffons swoop down from the sky and snatch the priest up in their claws, dealing `1d8+7` slashing damage. They're carried southwest across the valley to a mountain peak and dropped into a nest of young griffons. As the chicks devour the priest, the character takes `1d8+7` piercing damage and `2d8` mental damage. The affected creature must then attempt a DC 22 Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage from all damage dealt by the haunt.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes full damage and can't shake off the vision; they take `1d8` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and are [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened)—believing they're being eaten alive—as long as the bleed damage persists.
