# Formian Sting Trench *Hazard 4*  
[mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 25 trained  

A thin layer of canvas conceals this 10-foot-square pit, the walls of which are studded with dagger-sized formian stingers. Creatures that fall into the trap risk being gouged by the poisonous barbs.

- **Disable** DC 22 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (trained)  

- **AC** 18, **Fort** +8, **Ref** +8
- **Canvas HP** 30 (BT 15)
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Entrench** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([attack](rules/traits/attack.md))

- **Trigger**: A creature walks onto the canvas

**Effect** The creature falls into the [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) trench and takes falling damage (typically 10 bludgeoning damage). The creature is also gouged by three poisoned stingers as they fall. The creature can use the [Grab an Edge](rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md) reaction to avoid falling.

**Reset** Creatures can still fall into the trap, but the canvas must be reset manually for the trap to become [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) again.
