[mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 18 trained  

A nozzle attached to a pressure sensor under the flagstone path sprays thick wads of smelly sap.

- **Disable** DC 15 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (trained) to clog the nozzle or DC 14  

- **AC** 13, **Fort** +8, **Ref** +5
- **Nozzle Hardness** 10, **Nozzle HP** 30 (BT 15)
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage

- **Trigger**: A creature or object weighing at least 50 pounds is placed on one of the flagstones north of the gate (marked "T" on the map on page 32)

**Effect** Pressurized sap sprays from the nozzle, coating everything in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the area that fail a DC 20 Reflex save become affected by stink sap.

5 feet. Creatures and their equipment coated in the sap smell horrible. Creatures in the aura must attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened), and on a critical failure, the creature is also [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned). While within the aura, the creature takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to saves to recover from the [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to stink sap for 1 minute.

Creatures don't save against this effect in exploration mode and don't become temporarily immune, but creatures with stink sap on them must roll against their own aura when they roll initiative in encounter mode.

The sap dissipates after 10 hours; spending 10 minutes scrubbing the sap off with soap and water reduces the duration by 1 hour.

**Reset** 1 minute. The trap resets automatically twice before the supply of stink sap is exhausted.
