title: Routine

(2 actions) The haunt lures creatures into area **A2** using Captivate. Any actions it hasn't used to Captivate are used to drain a living creature in the room with Live a Thousand Lives.
```ad-embed-ability
title: **Captivate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") ([charm](rules/traits/charm-b1.md), [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md), [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md), [mental](rules/traits/mental.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md))
The faintly moving images compel one creature within 30 feet of the room to move into the room. The creature attempts a DC 38 Will save.
> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The target must spend all its actions on its next turn moving into the room, and is then [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) until the end of its next turn.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, and the target is also [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 minute.
