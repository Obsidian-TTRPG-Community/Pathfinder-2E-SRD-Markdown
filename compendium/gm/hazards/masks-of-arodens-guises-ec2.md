```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
[>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") An unmasked statue casts phantasmal killer (DC 27) against a target in the room for each of the trap's actions, creating an image of the statue lunging forth. It doesn't affect the same creature more than once; if there are fewer targets than it has actions, the trap doesn't use its remaining actions. Unmasking an additional statue increases the hazard's actions by 1, and replacing a mask reduces its actions by 1.
```
^routine

**Reset** The trap deactivates and resets 1 minute after it has no target creatures.
