# Forest Fire *Hazard 4*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [environmental](rules/traits/environmental.md "Environmental Hazard Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** -10  

A 10-foot-by-10-foot bonfire spreads to the surrounding forest on each of its turns.

- **Disable** A successful DC 22 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics), [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), or [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) check from an adjacent square is sufficient to smother one 5-foot-square of fire; each attempt is an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action. Dousing the flames automatically extinguishes one or more sections of fire, with no check. Water typically clears a 5-foot square if the amount is small (such as from a spell like create water or hydraulic push). Larger amounts of water, such as a full bucket, typically douse a 10-foot-by-10-foot area (or 4 squares in some other shape). Throwing a bucket of water on flames requires an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action. A waterskin doesn't contain enough water to put out even 1 square of fire.

Cold can also put out fire, but only if the cold can affect an area; cold is less effective than water, so a frost vial puts out only 1 square of fire, and a ray of frost is ineffective.

- **Trigger**: A brimorak urges the fire to spread out of control

**Effect** The bonfire becomes a forest fire and rolls initiative.

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
On its turn, the fire spreads into a number of additional squares equal to half the number of squares the fire currently occupies (minimum 1 square). You determine the squares the fire spreads into. Any creature that ends its turn next to the flames takes `2d8+5` fire damage, or `4d8+10` fire damage if it ended its turn within the flames (DC 25 basic Reflex save in either case). A creature can take damage from the forest fire only once per round.
