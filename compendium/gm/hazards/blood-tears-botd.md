# Blood Tears *Hazard 10*  
[haunt](rules/traits/haunt.md "Haunt Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 32 master to notice your vision tint red  

A wailing spirit appears and gouges their own eyes. As they do, blood seeps from the eyes of those who witness the act, obscuring their vision.

- **Disable** DC 30 [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) (master) to talk the spirit out of gouging its eyes or DC 32 [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) (trained) to ease the spirit's sorrows

- **Trigger**: A creature approaches within 15 feet

**Effect** Blood seeps from the eyes of all creatures within 30 feet, dealing [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). Each creature in the area must attempt a DC 33 Fortitude save.

> - **Success** The creature takes `2d8+3` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The creature takes `4d8+6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for as long as the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) lasts.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes `8d8+12` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for as long as the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) lasts.
