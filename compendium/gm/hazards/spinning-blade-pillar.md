# Spinning Blade Pillar *Hazard 4*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +11 trained or DC 26 (expert) to notice the control panel.  

A metal pole with three razor-sharp spinning blades is [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) in the floor, connected to trigger plates in up to eight floor tiles and a [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) control panel within 30 feet.

- **Disable** [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 21 (trained) twice on the pillar, or [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 19 (expert) once on the control panel deactivates the whole trap. Breaking the control panel prevents anyone from disabling the trap using the control panel and prevents the trap from deactivating automatically (see Reset below).  

- **AC** 21 , **Fort** +10, **Ref** +12
- **Panel Hardness** 5, **Panel HP** 20 (BT 10); **Pillar Hardness** 12, **Pillar HP** 48 (BT 24)
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage
- **Resistances** 
- **Weaknesses**

[attack](rules/traits/attack.md "Attack Combat Trait")

```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(3 actions) The trap uses its first action to make a spinning blade [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against each adjacent creature, its second action to move straight in a random direction (roll `1d4` to determine the direction), and its third action to make a spinning blade [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against each adjacent creature. This trap doesn't take a multiple attack penalty.
