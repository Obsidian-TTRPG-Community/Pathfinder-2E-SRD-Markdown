# Electric Latch Rune *Hazard 3*  
[electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait")  [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 20 trained  

An [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) rune imprinted on a door latch releases a powerful electric discharge.

- **Disable** [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 20 (expert) to scratch out the rune without allowing electricity to flow, or dispel magic (2nd level; counteract DC 18) to counteract the rune.

- **Trigger**: A creature grasps the door latch directly or with a tool.
