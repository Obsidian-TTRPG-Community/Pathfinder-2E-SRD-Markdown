Each turn, the fountain uses 1 action. Roll a `1d10` and look up the result on the following list to determine which action it uses that round.
```ad-embed-ability
title: **1–4 Single Target** The statue spins about and sprays water at a single random target in the room. Roll a `1d4` and count to the number you rolled, starting with the player on your left, to determine which hero gets attacked. The spray is a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with +10 to hit. On a hit, it deals `2d6` bludgeoning damage (doubled on a critical hit as normal).
```
```ad-embed-ability
title: **5–7 Corner Spray** The statue spins about, firing a spray of water at each corner of the room that still has a functioning corner mechanism. This hits any creature adjacent to the corner mechanism, dealing `2d6` bludgeoning damage. Each hero must attempt a DC 15 basic Reflex save, taking no damage on a critical success, half damage on a success, full damage on a failure, and double damage on a critical failure.
```
```ad-embed-ability
title: **8–9 Half Room** The statue spins about, spraying half of the room with water. Roll any die. If the result is even, it sprays the west half; otherwise, it sprays the east half. This deals `2d6` bludgeoning damage to each creature in that half of the room, and each hero must attempt a DC 15 basic Reflex save.
```
```ad-embed-ability
title: **10 Full Room** This works just like the half-room attack, but it targets everyone in the room.
