# Dream-Poisoned Door *Hazard 12*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 35 master  

Eerie shapes manifest within the doorway as it's opened, conjuring a group of four animate dreams into being.

- **Disable** DC 30 [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) (expert) to concentrate on the eldritch energies and diffuse them through meditation, DC 35 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (master) to scratch warding runes along the door's hinges and block dreams from manifesting, or dispel magic (6th level; counteract DC 30) to counteract the trap

title: **Manifest Dream Guardians** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md))

- **Trigger**: The door is opened

**Effect** A group of four animate dreams manifest in the area just beyond the door. These four animate dreams each appear as vaguely whale-shaped but human-sized masses of tendrils. They swim through he air and attack the intruders at once, fighting to the death and pursuing any who flee the temple.
