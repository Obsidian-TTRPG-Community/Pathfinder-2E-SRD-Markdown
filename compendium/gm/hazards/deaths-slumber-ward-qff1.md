# Death's Slumber Ward *Hazard 5*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +16 expert  

A whirlwind of four ephemeral, magical threads dispels the undead and shrouds the living in an endless slumber.

- **Disable** DC 23 [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) (expert) or DC 21 [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) (trained) to dissipate one of the four threads. Characters who failed or critically failed a [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check to participate in Grandfather Eiwa's funeral in Chapter 1 have been able to reflect on the experience; these characters gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks to disable this trap. The trap is destroyed when all four threads are dissipated.

- **Trigger**: A living or undead creature opens the trunk

**Effect** The ephemeral winds rise, sapping energy. All living and undead creatures within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) ([slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) on a critical failure). The trap then rolls initiative.

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

(4 actions) Each thread of energy passes through a random living or undead creature within 60 feet, dealing `4d6` damage (DC 22 basic Will save) to the creature.
A thread deals negative damage to living creatures and positive damage to undead creatures. Each thread passes through a different random creature, if possible.
Each dissipated thread reduces the trap's number of actions by 1.

**Reset** The haunt deactivates 1 minute after no living or undead creatures are within 100 feet, then resets.
