# Vision Of Dahak *Hazard 8*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +16 expert  

Blasts of fire and smoke pour out of the tunnel walls to coalesce into the burning form of [Dahak](compendium/setting/deities/dahak-logm.md) himself; a PC who succeeds at a DC 20 [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) notes that the fiery dragon closely resembles classical depictions of the draconic god of destruction.

- **Disable** [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) DC 26 (expert) to utter prayers to a nonevil deity to counteract [Dahak](compendium/setting/deities/dahak-logm.md)'s presence (prayers to [Apsu](compendium/setting/deities/apsu-logm.md) allow this check to be made if the character is merely trained in [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion)), [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 30 (expert) to divert the hazard's energies back upon themselves, or a successful dispel magic (4th level; counteract DC 26).  

- **AC** 27, **Fort** +17, **Ref** +13
- **HP** 130
- **Immunities** critical hits; [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait"); object immunities; precision damage
- **Weaknesses** cold 10

(2 actions) The vision of [Dahak](compendium/setting/deities/dahak-logm.md) manifests next to the creature that is closest to the center of the way station, then uses its Breath Weapon in a direction that catches the most possible targets in its area.

The vision of [Dahak](compendium/setting/deities/dahak-logm.md) unleashes a blast of fire from its burning maw, creating a 60-foot cone that deals `6d6` fire damage to all creatures within (DC 26 basic Reflex save).
