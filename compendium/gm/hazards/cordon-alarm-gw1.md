# Cordon Alarm *Hazard 2*  
[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 18 trained  

A hempen rope tied between trees emanates an [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), cylindrical barrier that sounds an alarm when crossed.

- **Disable** DC 18 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (trained) to move the rope without setting off the alarm, or dispel magic (1st level; counteract DC 16) to disable the rope's magic  

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Alarm** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md), [primal](rules/traits/primal.md))

- **Trigger**: An object or creature of at least 1 Bulk crosses an [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) vertical barrier extending 30 feet above and below the rope

**Effect** The rope squawks like an angry squirrel from the point where the barrier was breached. This alarm is as loud as a human scream and lasts for 1 minute.

If an item or creature is still breaching the barrier at the end of this duration, the alarm immediately triggers again.

**Reset** The alarm resets immediately. Multiple breaches can cause the alarm to sound in multiple places at the same time, though the alarm can still be triggered only once per round.
