```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

(1 action) The hazard fires one bolt at every creature in a 30-foot-by-30-foot area in front of the gate as 1 action. Because the spectral archers fire bolts continuously, the haunt can also use the Continuous Barrage free action (below) to fire bolts at each creature during that creature's turn.

**Reset** The haunt vanishes permanently if the graveknights are destroyed. Otherwise, it returns after 1 hour.
