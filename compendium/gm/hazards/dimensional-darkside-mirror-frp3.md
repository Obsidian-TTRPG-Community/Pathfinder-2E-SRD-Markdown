# Dimensional Darkside Mirror *Hazard 19*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +37 master to notice it isn't a regular mirror.  

A magic mirror replaces characters with evil mirror duplicates from another dimension.

- **Disable** [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 40 (legendary) to retrieve a creature from the other dimension within 10 minutes of the switch (possible only if their mirror duplicate is dead), [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 45 (master) to permanently disable the mirror once all mirror duplicates are dead, or dispel magic (8th level; counteract DC 37) to counteract the mirror for 1 minute and prevent additional replacements during that time.  

- **Fort** +25, **Ref** +20
- **Hardness** 1, **HP** 4 (BT 2)  the mirror can't be damaged while any mirror duplicate is alive

- **Trigger**: A non-evil creature is reflected in the mirror

**Effect** The mirror absorbs the creature into the mirror, replacing it with an evil mirror duplicate (DC 41 Reflex to avoid being absorbed into the mirror), and rolls initiative.

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

(1 action) The mirror absorbs another reflected creature into the mirror and replaces it with a mirror duplicate. Mirror duplicates attack on their own initiative, using the same statistics as the original creature, but with an evil alignment (changing only abilities that shift with the alignment change). A mirror duplicate can spend 3 actions in contact with the mirror to return to its original dimension and release the creature it duplicated, but most mirror duplicates prefer not to.
```
^routine

**Reset** The mirror is always ready to absorb creatures into the other dimension. Ten minutes after a creature is sucked into the mirror, if an ally doesn't rescue the creature with [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery), it reaches the other dimension, where it might be captured or killed. In the mirror dimension, it counts as a mirror duplicate, so the denizens of the other dimension can't destroy the mirror on their side while the absorbed creature is there. These dimensions are alternate realities, not planes, so even rituals like plane shift can't reach them.
