# Quaking Slither *Hazard 14*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [environmental](rules/traits/environmental.md "Environmental Hazard Trait")  [kaiju](rules/traits/kaiju-frp2.md "Kaiju  Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** DC 10  

Ebeshra slithers across the ground, causing the earth to tremble as though from a powerful earthquake.

- **Disable** three DC 38 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) (trained), [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) (trained), or [Engineering Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) (trained) checks to brace a small structure or surface to cancel the effects of the quake in that area, or a single DC 41 [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) (master) check to entreat Ebeshra to stand down

- **Trigger**: Ebeshra moves at least 60 feet on land

**Effect** The ground shakes in a 120-foot emanation from Ebeshra's space. This creates a variety of effects depending on the surrounding environment.

In an area without significant underground space, the ground becomes greater difficult terrain, and creatures on it are [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) and [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 round.

In areas with existing underground spaces (like sewers, sinkholes, or catacombs), fissures open up in the ground. Creatures in the area tumble into the resulting 80-foot-deep hole unless they succeed at a DC 40 Reflex save.

In bays, on beaches, and in other relatively substantial but shallow bodies of water, the tremors create dangerous waves. Creatures in the water or within 60 feet of the waterline are struck by waves that deal `10d8` bludgeoning damage (DC 35 basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, a creature is instantly swept 60 feet out to sea and 60 feet under the water's surface.
```

**Reset** Ebeshra doesn't rush again this way for `1d4` rounds.
