# Summoning Rune (Barbazu Devil) *Hazard 5*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +11 trained  

A summoning circle inlaid into the room's floor detects living creatures and summons a violent devil.

- **Disable** DC 18 [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) to notice the trap's magic and avoid stepping on the floor outside the circle, followed by DC 21 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (trained) to break the circle or dispel magic (3rd level; counteract DC 23) to counteract the rune.

title: **Summon Devil** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md), summon)

- **Trigger**: A living creature steps on any part of the floor not enclosed by the summoning circle

**Effect** One round after a creature touches the triggering area, the door to the room slams shut and locks (two DC 20 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) checks to pick) and a barbazu devil appears in the summoning circle. The devil rolls initiative and remains for `3d6` rounds, after which the spell ends and the devil disappears. The devil also disappears if someone disables the trap before the duration expires. The summoned devil can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures.
