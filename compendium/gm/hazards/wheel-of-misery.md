```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

(2 actions) On its initiative, the trap uses its first action to spin, then stops. Roll `1d6` to determine which segment is topmost when the wheel stops spinning. The wheel uses its second action to replicate the spell listed for that segment (3rd level, DC 24, spell attack roll +14). This spell's target is centered on or otherwise includes the nearest creature in the area. This increases the spell's range to 100 feet if necessary.
Any spell cast by this trap is arcane.
