- **Complexity** Simple

```

- **Trigger**: A creature takes a [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action against Mogaru, produces a visible area effect, or flies within 120 feet of Mogaru

**Effect** Mogaru breathes a 120-foot cone of fire toward the object of his ire. Flammable objects in the area immediately combust, and stone or metal surfaces warp into difficult terrain. Creatures in the area take `20d6` fire damage (DC 44 basic Reflex save). On a failed or critically failed save, a creature also takes `3d6` [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
```

**Reset** Mogaru must wait `1d4` rounds before letting loose another gout of fire.
