title: **Glowing Spores** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature moves into the mushrooms' space or damages the mushrooms. The mushrooms can't use this reaction if the damage was cold damage.

**Effect** The triggering creature and all creatures within 10 feet are sprayed with itchy, distracting, glowing spores and must attempt a DC 22 Reflex save. On a failed save, the creatures become [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) (or [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) on a critical failure) and take a â€“4 penalty to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks until the spores lose potency in 24 hours or are removed. This requires washing them off by bathing in water for a minute, a [prestidigitation](compendium/spells/prestidigitation.md) spell, or a similar measure allowed by the GM.
