# Electrified Water Ward *Hazard 8*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +18 expert  

Passing over an [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) rune on the floor between the north and south doors triggers a dancing burst of electricity.

- **Disable** DC 26 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (expert), DC 28 [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) (expert),  

```ad-embed-ability
title: **or DC** 28 [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) (expert) to harmlessly bleed away the electrical energy from the rune. Once the trap has been activated, the electrical energy is stronger, so three successful checks (of any combination of the relevant skills) are necessary to deactivate it, but these checks can be attempted from anywhere in the room.
```

title: **Electrocution** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md), [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md))

- **Trigger**: A creature passes over the [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) underwater rune between the north and south doors

**Effect** The trap deals `4d10` electricity damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save) to creatures touching the water, and then rolls initiative.

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

(1 action) The trap deals `4d10` electricity damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save) to all creatures in the room.
A creature that fails the save is [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) ([slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) on a critical failure). A creature that isn't touching the water treats the result of its saving throw as one degree of success better.

**Reset** The pulses stop as soon as no creatures are in the hallway, and then reset after 1 hour.
