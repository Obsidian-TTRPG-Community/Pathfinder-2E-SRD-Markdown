# Toppling Furniture *Hazard 2*  
[haunt](rules/traits/haunt.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 18 trained to hear the spirit's grunt of exertion as it works to topple the furniture  

A mischievous spirit pushes a bookshelf over onto a creature.

- **Disable** DC 16 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) to hold the furniture upright or DC 18 [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) (trained) to foil the spirit's efforts to influence matter

- **Trigger**: A creature moves adjacent to the furniture

**Effect** The spirit shoves the furniture over in an attempt to crush the triggering creature. The triggering creature takes `2d10+7` bludgeoning damage (DC 22 basic Reflex save). On a failure, the creature is additionally knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
```

**Reset** If the haunt successfully damages a creature with Topple Furniture, the spirit laughs for `1d4` rounds as the haunt resets; each subsequent time the haunt activates, it must topple a different piece of upright furniture. If the haunt fails to damage a creature, the spirit wails in frustration and resets after pouting for `1d4` hours.
