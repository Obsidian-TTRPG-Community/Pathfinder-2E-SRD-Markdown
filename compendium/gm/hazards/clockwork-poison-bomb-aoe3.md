# Clockwork Poison Bomb *Hazard 11*  
[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** The bomb uses Oggvurm's initiative roll as its [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) roll.  

A clockwork bomb releases gouts of poisonous smoke. The smoke issues forth from a single nozzle attached to two tanks of pressurized poison.

- **Disable** three DC 31 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (expert) checks to a Device to disable the latches that lock the nozzle in place, then one DC 35 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (master) check to a Device to turn off the nozzle; DCs decrease by 2 if Oggvurm is [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), or dead.  

- **AC** 32, **Fort** +24, **Ref** +26
- **Nozzle Hardness** 5, **Nozzle HP** 20 (BT 10) to ruin the nozzle (making it impossible to disable, in which case the only way to disarm the bomb is to destroy both its tanks); **Tank Hardness** 15, **Tank HP** 80 (BT 40) to destroy one of the tanks (both tanks must be destroyed to disarm the bomb)
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage

title: **Poisonous Cloud** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md), [poison](rules/traits/poison.md))

- **Trigger**: The bomb is Activated, which requires 3 actions

**Effect** The bomb releases a smoky cloud of blackfinger blight in a 20-foot radius. Creatures within the smoke are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) from other creatures. Any creature that starts its turn in the smoke must roll a saving throw to avoid being afflicted by blackfinger blight poison (see page 78). The cloud remains for 1 minute or until dispersed by strong winds.

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

(1 action) On its turn, the bomb spews forth a smoky gout of airborne blackfinger blight poison. The cloud fills a 20-foot radius, or a 10-foot radius if only one tank remains intact. If the bomb is already in the center of a blackfinger blight cloud, the radius of that cloud increases by 20 feet (or 10 feet, if only one tank remains intact) instead.
```

**Reset** The trap issues smoke for 3 minutes before its tanks run dry. The tanks must be replaced before the bomb can be reactivated.
