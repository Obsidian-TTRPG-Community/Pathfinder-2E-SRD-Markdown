# Abyss-Warped Trees *Hazard 4*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [environmental](rules/traits/environmental.md "Environmental Hazard Trait")  [unique](rules/traits/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** DC 12 trained to determine the trees can move  

A forest of fiendish trees swing their branches and shift their roots to bludgeon and trip creatures in the tainted grove (area A21).

- **Disable** DC 22 [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) (trained) to find a location the trees can't reach or DC 24 [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) to recite a prayer that temporarily casts out the fiendish energy inside a single tree in the grove, disabling it for 1 minute. A disabled or destroyed tree creates a 5-foot-square area in the grove that's safe from this hazard.  

- **AC** 18, **Fort** +14, **Ref** +14
- **Hardness** 10, **HP** 40 (BT 20) per tree
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage
- **Weaknesses** fire 5

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Shift Roots** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature ends its movement in the grove

**Effect** The trees throughout the tainted grove shift their roots wildly, making the area difficult terrain, then the Abyss-warped trees roll initiative.
```
```ad-embed-ability
title: **Tighten Grip** [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action")

- **Trigger**: The Abyss-warped trees critically hit a creature with a branch [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)

**Effect** The Abyssâ€‘warped trees loop their branches around the triggering creature, grabbing it ([Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) DC 21).
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

(4 actions) The Abyss-warped trees use their first action each round to lash their roots; each creature in the tainted grove must succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save or fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone). The Abyss-warped trees use their second, third, and fourth actions to make branch Strikes against up to three different creatures in the tainted grove.
```
^routine

**Reset** The Abyss-warped trees cease moving 1 minute after no living creatures are in the tainted grove.
They reset immediately. A disabled tree reanimates after 1 minute. A destroyed tree regrows after 1 month.
