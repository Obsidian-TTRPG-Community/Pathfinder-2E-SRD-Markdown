# Soporific Lecture *Hazard 8*  
[mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 28 expert  

Several [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) nozzles spray colorless sleeping gas into the seating area.

- **Disable** DC 28 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (expert) to crimp shut the primary feeding tube for the gas, or DC 31 [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) (expert) to discover the [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) bypass switch next to the door to area A3 that shuts the trap off  

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Gas Spray** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md), [mental](rules/traits/mental.md), [poison](rules/traits/poison.md), [sleep](rules/traits/sleep.md))

- **Trigger**: Pressure is applied to any of the steps in the middle of the seating area, or applied to the manual trigger on the stage. This manual trigger can activate the trap even if its [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) bypass switch is engaged

**Effect** Sleeping gas is silently sprayed into the seating area. All creatures in the area must roll a DC 26 Will save to resist its effects.

The gas persists in the area for 3 rounds before becoming inert. Any creature who ends their turn in this area during these 3 rounds must attempt a new DC 26 Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and realizes that the area has been gassed.
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected but doesn't notice the gas.
> - **Failure** The creature feels a bit drowsy and lethargic, and becomes [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) for 1 minute. If the creature is already [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued), it instead falls [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). If it's still [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) after 1 minute, it wakes up automatically.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature falls [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). If it's still [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) after 1 hour, it wakes up automatically.
