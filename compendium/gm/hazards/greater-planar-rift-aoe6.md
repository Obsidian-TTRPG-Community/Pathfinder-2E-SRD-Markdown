# Greater Planar Rift *Hazard 21*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 41 legendary  

A ragged planar rift drags things into its depths and hurls creatures through from its terminal end.

- **Disable** dispel magic (9th level; counteract DC 46) to seal the rift.

title: **Greater Planar Rift** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md), [teleportation](rules/traits/teleportation.md))

- **Trigger**: A creature moves within 5 feet of the rift

**Effect** The creature must succeed at a DC 44 Will save or be drawn into the rift. A creature so drawn in becomes [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) and immediately teleports to a different random area in Kharnas's ruins.
