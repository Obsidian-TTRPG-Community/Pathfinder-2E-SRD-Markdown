# Arcane Feedback Trap *Hazard 13*  
[arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 35 expert  

A spike of stone bursts from the south wall and quickly retracts.

- **Disable** DC 33 [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) (master) to quell the rippling stone or dispel magic (7th level, counteract DC 31) to dispel the magical feedback.  

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Stone Spike** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [earth](rules/traits/earth.md), [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md))

- **Trigger**: A creature in area E1 casts an arcane spell or uses an arcane ability

**Effect** The trap makes a stone spike attack against the triggering creature. For the next 1 minute thereafter, the ripples are stronger, giving the trap a +2 circumstance bonus on stone spike [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) during this time.
