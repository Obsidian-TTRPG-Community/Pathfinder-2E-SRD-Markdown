# The Laughing Fiend's Greeting *Hazard 20*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 46 legendary  

Subtle but deadly magical runes link this mural to Kharnas's master. Good- or neutral-aligned creatures who examine the mural witness the castle's drawbridge silently descend, revealing an endless darkness.

- **Disable** DC 44 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (legendary) to obscure or mar the magical runes set into the mural, or dispel magic (9th level; counteract DC 42) to counteract the mural.

title: **Tegresin's Greeting** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md))

- **Trigger**: A creature capable of casting divine magic examines the mural

**Effect** The mural casts weird (DC 43 Will save) on all creatures in the gallery. A snarl fills the creatures' minds.
