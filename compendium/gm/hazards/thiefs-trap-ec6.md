# Thief's Trap *Hazard 20*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 50 master to notice that the hairline cracks on the passage walls actually form runes.  

Nearly imperceptible runes set off an explosion at the point a thief is most unable to receive aid.

- **Disable** DC 45 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (master) or dispel magic (10th level, counteract DC 50) to counteract the runes.  
     
```ad-embed-ability
title: Explosion [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature crosses a rune

**Effect** The runes unleash a gout of fire roaring up the chute. Anyone in the chute and within 5 feet of its openings is dealt `8d10+44` fire damage (DC 42 basic Reflex save). Immediately thereafter, the runes emanate a 4th-level [silence](compendium/spells/silence.md) effect for 1 minute, so anyone injured in the chute can't call out for help.
```

**Reset** The trap resets in 1 minute.
