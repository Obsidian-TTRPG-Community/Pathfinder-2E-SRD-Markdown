- **Trigger**: A creature enters the area

**Effect** The hounds manifest and bay loudly, dealing `3d10+16` sonic damage to all creatures within 30 feet of the hounds (DC 33 basic Fortitude save). On a failed check, a creature is additionally [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened). The trap then rolls initiative.

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

(9 actions) The trap loses 3 actions each round for each hound disabled. Each hound uses three actions to [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) 40 feet after creatures in the room, passing through corporeal creatures during this movement if possible. Each creature the hound moves through during its movement takes `2d8+7` negative damage (DC 37 Reflex negates). A creature can only be damaged by each hound once each round, no matter how many times the hound moves through their space.
