# Jealous Abjurer *Hazard 11*  
[haunt](rules/traits/haunt.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 33 master  

A robe-clad spirit rises out of the floor, pointing an accusing finger.

- **Disable** DC 36 [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) (master) to convince the spirit that the target's magical knowledge is too great to be trifled with

- **Trigger**: A creature that is currently affected by a beneficial spell approaches within 30 feet of the abjurer

**Effect** Envying the fame and magical prowess of others, the jealous abjurer attempts to engineer a catastrophic failure in the highest-level beneficial spell currently affecting its target. It attempts a counteract check with a +26 modifier. If the counteract check succeeds, the spell is dispelled, and the creature it had been affecting takes `4d12+30` force damage as the spell violently implodes (DC 32 basic Reflex save).
