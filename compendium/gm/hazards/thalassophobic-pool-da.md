# Thalassophobic Pool *Hazard 12*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** DC 25 trained  

The pool sucks in creatures that fall into it, making them sink into its endless depths.

- **Disable** DC 32 (master) [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) or [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) to quell the fear and calm the pool or DC 35 [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) to give the pool something worse to fear; three successes required.  
     
```ad-embed-ability
title: Downpour [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature falls into the pool

**Effect** More water pours forth from the chalice. Creatures in the pool become [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy), and they can't decrease their [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) condition so long as they remain in the pool. The trap then rolls initiative.
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(3 actions) Water from the chalice increases the depth of the water by 10 feet for each action. Each time this happens, creatures in the pool are pushed 10 feet down and take `1d6` bludgeoning damage. As the pool has no bottom, creatures in it can fall down indefinitely; they must [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) up to avoid drowning, but the water is especially choppy, so the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) DC is 25. The pool never overflows. Each successful check to Disable reduces the pool's actions by 1, and once the pool is completely Disabled, the water becomes still and the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) DC to [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) becomes 10.
```

**Reset** The trap resets once there are no moving creatures in it.
