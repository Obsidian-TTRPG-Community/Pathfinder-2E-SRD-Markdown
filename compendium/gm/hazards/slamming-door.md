title: Slam Shut [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: Pressure is placed on any floor tile.

**Effect** The door falls, closing off the hallway. The stone slab deals `3d8` bludgeoning damage to anyone beneath or adjacent to the slab when it drops and pushes them out of its space in a random direction. A creature that succeeds at a DC 17 Reflex save takes no damage and rolls out of the way in a random direction. On a critical success, they can choose the direction. Lifting the fallen slab requires a successful DC 25 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check. Hitting the floor panels triggers the trap. The slab uses the same AC and saves as the trap, but it has Hardness 12, HP 48 (BT 24).
