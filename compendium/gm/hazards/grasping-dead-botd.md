[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [haunt](rules/traits/haunt.md "Haunt Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +12 expert  

Hands of the buried dead rise from the ground, grabbing and tearing at creatures in the area to drag them underground.

- **Disable** DC 22 [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) (trained) to ritually pray for the dead or DC 24 [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) (trained) to exorcise the spirits' anger; two total successes are required to disable the haunt  

- **Hardness** 10; **per instrument HP** 22 (BT 11)
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Shifting Earth** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: At least two creatures enter the area

**Effect** The earth shifts wildly as the hands of the dead spring forth from the ground. The area becomes difficult terrain. Creatures within the area are knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) unless they succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save. The haunt then rolls initiative.
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

(1 action) The grasping hands batter all creatures in the area, dealing `2d6+7` bludgeoning damage (DC 26 basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, a creature is dragged partially into the earth, becoming [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) until it [Escapes](rules/actions/escape.md) (DC 26). If already [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), it's fully submerged and must hold its breath to avoid suffocation.
```
^routine

**Reset** The haunt deactivates 1 minute after all living creatures leave the area. After 1 hour, the haunt reactivates.
