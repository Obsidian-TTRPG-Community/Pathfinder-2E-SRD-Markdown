# Sigil of Deepest Fears *Hazard 17*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 43 master  

An arcane sigil forces creatures to confront their greatest fear.

- **Disable** DC 43 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (master) to drain the sigil's power harmlessly, or dispel magic (9th level; counteract DC 42) to counteract the sigil
