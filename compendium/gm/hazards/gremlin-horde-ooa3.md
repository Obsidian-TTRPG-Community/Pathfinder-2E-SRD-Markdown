# Gremlin Horde *Hazard 6*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +18 expert  

Three gangs of gremlins hide within the spiral centurion, cackling with glee and hurling blasts of hex magic. The hazard occupies the same space as the spiral centurion, moving with it.

- **Disable** DC 25 [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana), [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), or [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) (trained) to devise counter-hex symbols that frighten and scatter a gremlin gang, or DC 28 [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) (expert) to capture and scatter a gremlin gang  

- **AC** 27, **Fort** +11, **Ref** +17
- **Hardness** 15 (while inside the centurion); **HP** 22 per gremlin gang

title: **Hexed Calamity** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature comes within 30 feet of the gremlin horde

**Effect** Every firearm within 30 feet misfires (Guns & Gears 152). If a creature is holding the firearm, they can attempt a DC 27 Will save, negating this effect on a success. The hazard rolls initiative.
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

(3 actions; misfortune) The gremlin horde hurls one tinkering curse with each action, targeting an item within 60 feet wielded or worn by a creature. The creature must attempt a DC 27 Will save. The gremlin horde loses 1 action for each gremlin gang that's scattered.
> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The hex bounces back to affect the gremlin horde. For 1 round, all creatures gain a +1 status bonus to checks to disable this hazard.
> - **Success** The item is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The item becomes unreliable for 1 round. If a creature attempts to Activate the item or [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) with it, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is wasted. If the item doesn't have an active use (such a mundane cloak), the creature wearing the item must instead immediately succeed at a DC 5 flat check or become tangled with the item and fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature wielding or wearing the item also becomes [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy).
```

**Reset** If not captured or killed, the scattered gremlin gangs regroup after `1d4` hours.
