[mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple

Four pressure plates beneath the floorboards activate dragon-headed fountains on either side of the room, which spray boiling water across the area between them.

- **Disable** DC 21 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (trained) to disable each pressure plate, DC 16 to jam each fountain, or DC 18 to deflect a fountain's spray.  

- **AC** 15, **Fort** +8, **Ref** +5
- **Fountain Hardness** 8, **Fountain HP** 30 (BT 15)

title: **Scalding Spray** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([fire](rules/traits/fire.md), [water](rules/traits/water.md))

- **Trigger**: Weight is placed on one of the squares marked with "T" on the map, triggering a pressure plate

**Effect** The fountains spray boiling water across their own squares and the 10-footby- 20-foot area between them (marked with dotted lines), dealing `4d6+4` fire damage to any creatures in the area (DC 22 basic Reflex save).
