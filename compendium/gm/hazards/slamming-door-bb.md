# Slamming Door *Hazard 1*  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 17 [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check

- **AC** 16, **Fort** +10, **Ref** +2
- **Hardness** 5, **HP** 20 (BT 10)
- **Immunities** critical hits; sneak attack

title: **Slam Shut** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([attack](rules/traits/attack.md))


When pressure is placed on any floor tile, the door falls, closing off the hallway. The stone slab deals `3d8` bludgeoning damage to anyone beneath or adjacent to the slab when it drops and pushes them out of its space in a random direction. A creature that succeeds at a DC 17 Reflex save takes no damage and rolls out of the way in a random direction. On a critical success, they roll out of the way and can choose which direction.

Lifting the fallen slab requires a successful DC 25 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check. Hitting the floor panels triggers the trap. The slab uses the same AC and saves as the trap, but it has Hardness 12, HP 48 (BT 24).
