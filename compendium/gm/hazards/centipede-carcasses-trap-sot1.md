# Centipede Carcasses Trap *Hazard 5*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +11 trained  

Three giant centipede carcasses have wire springs that pull out and fling their sharpened legs around the room.

- **Disable** DC 23 [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature) (trained) to bend the centipede carapace so the wire can't pull out any more legs, or DC 21 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (expert) to cut the springy wires. After all three carcasses are disabled (regardless of the check used), the trap is deactivated. The trap automatically deactivates after 10 rounds.  

- **AC** 22 , **Fort** +15, **Ref** +9
- **Carcass Hardness** 12, **Carcass HP** 20 (BT 10)

title: Volley of Legs [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A carcass is touched or jostled

**Effect** Each creature within 30 feet of any centipede carcass takes `4d4` piercing damage (DC 22 basic Reflex save), and the area becomes difficult terrain due to the many sharpened legs on the ground. Each creature that [Strides](rules/actions/stride.md) more than 10 feet through the area must succeed at a DC 20 [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check or take `1d4` piercing damage. The trap then rolls initiative.

(1 action) Each creature within 30 feet of a centipede carcass that hasn't been disabled takes `6d4` piercing damage (DC 22 basic Reflex save).
