# Hands Of The Forgotten *Hazard 8*  
[haunt](rules/traits/haunt.md "Haunt Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 28 trained  

Ethereal hands stretch out from the walls and floor, attempting to restrain nearby creatures.

- **Disable** DC 30 [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) (master) to exorcise the spirits or DC 32 [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) (expert) to scare away the hands.
