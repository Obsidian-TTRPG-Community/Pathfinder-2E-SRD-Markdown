title: **Collapse** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature moves into the unstable tunnel

**Effect** The tunnel collapses in a cave-in that deals `4d8+10` bludgeoning damage to the triggering creature and all creatures in area A2 (DC 21 basic Reflex save). On a failed save, the triggering creature is [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) ([Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) DC 21). This collapse fully blocks the tunnel (area A2), making it impassable.
