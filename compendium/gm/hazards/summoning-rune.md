# Summoning Rune *Hazard 1*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +7 trained  

A cloud of [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) magical sensors in a 10-foot radius surrounds an [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) wall or floor rune the size of the creature to be summoned.

- **Disable** [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) DC 15 to approach without triggering the trap followed by [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 17 (trained) to erase the rune, or dispel magic (1st level; counteract DC 15) to counteract the rune.

title: **Summon Monster** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md), summon)

- **Trigger**: A creature enters the cloud of magical sensors.

**Effect** This trap summons a specific level 1 creature, determined when the trap is created. The creature rolls initiative and remains for `2d6` rounds, after which the spell ends and the creature disappears. The creature also disappears if someone disables the trap before the duration expires. The summoned creature can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures.
