# Scholar's Bane *Hazard 4*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +14 trained to notice magical sensors [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) within four of the carvings' eyes  

Illusion magic overwhelms the minds of particularly intelligent creatures, forcing them to relive every intellectual failure and shame they've ever suffered.

- **Disable** DC 22 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (trained) to carve out one eye sensor, DC 22 [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) or [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) (trained) to blank out one's mind (disables trap for self only), or dispel magic (2nd level; counteract DC 20) to counteract one eye sensor  

- **AC** 20, **Fort** +12, **Ref** +8
- **Eye Hardness** 6, **Eye HP** 20

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Reveal Failurs** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature with an Intelligence score of 10 or greater enters the room

**Effect** The trap fills the triggering creature's mind with shameful memories. The creature must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or take `2d8+2` mental damage. The trap then rolls initiative.
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine

(4 actions) The trap uses each action to target a creature in the room with an Intelligence score of 10 or greater. A target must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or take `2d8+2` mental damage. On a critical failure, the creature takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to Speed for 1 minute as they stagger under the weight of their failures. The trap loses 1 action for each eye sensor disabled or destroyed.

**Reset** The trap can function for 10 rounds, which don't need to be consecutive, before it must recharge for 24 hours.
