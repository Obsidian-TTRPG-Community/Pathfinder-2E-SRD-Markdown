[divine](rules/traits/divine.md)  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [fire](rules/traits/fire.md)  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md)  

The target of the haunt's initial Ghostly Assault, as well as any creature later hit by a burning lash [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), loses random memories, as if these thoughts were incinerated like pages in a burning book. The creature must attempt a DC 23 Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature becomes [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 minute while they forget random memories, as if these thoughts were incinerated like pages in a burning book.
> - **Failure** As success, but the [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) condition persists for 24 hours.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied).
