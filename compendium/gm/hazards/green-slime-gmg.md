# Green Slime *Hazard 9*  
[environmental](rules/traits/environmental.md "Environmental Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 30 expert  

A caustic green film clings to the ceiling above, watching for prey to pass beneath it.

- **Disable** DC 33 [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) (expert) to carefully peel the slime off the ceiling without touching it  

- **AC** 20 , **Fort** +25, 
- **HP** 200 (BT 100)
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage
- **Resistances** 
- **Weaknesses** cold 20; fire 20

title: Dissolving Ambush [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature walks beneath the slime

**Effect** The green slime drops on top of the creature, attempting to dissolve it into a nutritious slurry. The target must attempt a DC 28 Reflex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target leaps out of the way, and it is unaffected.
> - **Success** A small amount of the slime splashes onto the target. The target is [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained).
> - **Failure** The slime lands on its target. The target is [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained), and this condition value increases by 1 at the end of its turn each round until the slime is removed. If the target reaches [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained), the next time its [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) value would increase, it dies and collapses into a slurry of nutrients. A slime covering a target can no longer be removed through [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) checks, and damage dealt to the slime is also dealt to the target (applying the target's immunities, weaknesses, and resistances rather than those of the green slime).
> - **Critical Failure** The slime completely coats its target. This has the same effect as a failure, except the target is immediately [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained), becomes [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) after 1 round, and dies after 2 rounds.
```

**Reset** 1 hour, as the slime feasts and then slowly creeps back up to the ceiling
