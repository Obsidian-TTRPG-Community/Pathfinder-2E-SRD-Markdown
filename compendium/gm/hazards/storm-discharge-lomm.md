- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 10  

Ebeshra aligns its crystalline form to produce a blast of lightning that charges the surrounding area with electrical energy.

- **Disable** DC 45 [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature) (master) to balance the electrical charges in the area or DC 48 [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) (expert) to momentarily divert Ebeshra's attention

title: Lightning Blast [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature takes a hostile action against Ebeshra, produces a visible area effect, or flies within 120 feet of Ebeshra;

**Effect** Ebeshra unleashes a 240-foot line of electricity toward the triggering creature. Creatures in the line take `16d8` electricity damage (DC 42 basic Reflex save). The electricity creates a static field in all squares that the line passed through and all adjacent squares. For 1 round, any creatures that enter a space in the static field take `4d8` electricity damage (DC 38 basic Reflex save).
```

**Reset** Ebeshra waits 1d4 rounds before another blast.
