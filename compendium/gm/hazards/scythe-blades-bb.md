title: **Falling Scythes** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([attack](rules/traits/attack.md))


When the trip wire is pulled or severed, both blades swing down, each one attacking all creatures under the ceiling grooves. The trap makes a melee attack with each blade with +17 to each attack roll. There's no multiple attack penalty on these attacks. On a hit, a blade deals `2d12 + 4` slashing damage. On a critical hit, the damage is doubled plus 6 extra damage.
