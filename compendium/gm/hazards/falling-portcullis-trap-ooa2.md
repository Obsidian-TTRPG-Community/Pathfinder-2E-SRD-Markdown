- **Trigger**: The pressure plate is depressed

**Effect** The portcullis falls, closing off the hallway.

Any creature under the portcullis when it drops takes `4d10+18` piercing damage and is [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized). A creature that succeeds at a DC 26 Reflex save takes no damage and rolls away in a random direction; on a critical success, they can choose the direction. (For the rules on freeing an [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) creature, see the sidebar on page 515 of the Core Rulebook.) If the trap was triggered by a creature moving north with a Speed of at least 10 feet, they're considered to be under the portcullis when it triggers. Creatures moving south when triggering the portcullis aren't considered to be under the portcullis when it triggers.
