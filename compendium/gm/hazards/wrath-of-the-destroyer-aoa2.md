- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +22 expert to notice subtle vapors of magical energy seething across the doors.  

These heavy doors, carved with an image of [Dahak](compendium/setting/deities/dahak-logm.md), echo with a hatred so powerful that it can kill anyone who comes nearby, manifesting a vision of [Dahak](compendium/setting/deities/dahak-logm.md)'s head emerging from the doors to strike at a foe.

- **Disable** [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 29 (expert) to disrupt the divine magic, [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) DC 29 (expert) to placate the wrathful energies, or [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) (5th level; counteract DC 26).  

- **AC** 30, **Fort** +22, **Ref** +14
- **Door Hardness** 18, **Door HP** 72 (BT 36)
- **Immunities** critical hits; [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait"); object immunities; precision damage
