- **AC** 16 , **Fort** +10, **Ref** +8
- **HP** 8

title: Snowdrop [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature moves beneath where the snowfall is resting

**Effect** Ice and snow fall on the triggering creature, dealing `2d6+3` bludgeoning damage (DC 18 basic Reflex save) and soaking their clothing. Until they change into fresh clothing or spend at least an hour in an area of normal or higher temperature, they treat cold environments as one step colder (for example, mild cold as severe cold).
