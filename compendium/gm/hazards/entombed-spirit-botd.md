[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [haunt](rules/traits/haunt.md "Haunt Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +11 trained  

The wall bulges out in the shape of a howling humanoid face as it twists and forms tendrils reaching for nearby creatures. This haunt is formed when a murder victim is entombed within a wall before or after their death.

- **Disable** DC 17 [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism) (trained) to weaken the spirit, DC 18 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) (trained) to force the spirit's face back inside the wall, or DC 19 [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) (trained) to talk down the spirit; two total successes across all skills are required to disable the haunt  

- **AC** 15, **Fort** +11, **Ref** +5
- **Hardness** 9 (wall); **HP** 30 (BT 15)
- **Immunities** object immunities

- **Trigger**: A creature moves adjacent to the wall where the corpse is entombed

**Effect** The spirit gasps and wails for aid while the wall takes on the shape of its face and roils, growing tendrils. All creatures within 10 feet must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) for as long as the haunt remains active. The haunt then rolls initiative

title: Routine

(3 actions) The spirit attempts to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) up to two creatures within 10 feet with a +14 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) modifier, then squeezes each creature it has [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), dealing `1d10+4` damage. The haunt doesn't apply a multiple attack penalty to the second attempt to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md).

**Reset** The haunt deactivates 1 minute after all creatures leave the area and resets immediately thereafter. If disabled, the haunt resets after 1 day. The haunt is permanently destroyed if the remains of the deceased are removed from the wall.
