# Needling Stairs *Hazard 11*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +20 expert  

This staircase has springs in each step, which send poisoned needles shooting up through tiny holes in the wood when stepped on. Each step, 6 in total, takes up one 5-foot square.

- **Disable** DC 33 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (master) on each stair to disable its spring, or deactivate the switch in area C8 to deactivate the whole trap. Cutting the wire on the topmost stair (DC 35 to the Device) that connects the staircase to the control switch prevents the control switch from turning the trap on or off.  

- **AC** 28, **Fort** +22, **Ref** +19
- **Hardness** 8, **HP** 25 (BT 12) to break the spring under the step and make that step safe to stand on

- **Trigger**: A creature ends its movement on one of the stairs

**Effect** The trap makes a poisoned needle [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against the triggering creature, then rolls initiative.

title: Routine

(1 action) The trap makes a separate poisoned needle [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against each creature currently on an active step as 1 action. Because it is constantly jabbing needles up through any weight-bearing steps, the trap can also use its Bloody Feet free action (see below) to jab at a creature on one of the steps during that creature's turn.
