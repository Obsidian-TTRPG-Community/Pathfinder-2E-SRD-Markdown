# Pharaoh's Ward *Hazard 7*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 25 expert  

A curse is imbued on an entryway's threshold.

- **Disable** [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) DC 27 (master) to painstakingly remove the lintel without triggering the magic, or dispel magic (4th level; counteract DC 25) to counteract the rune.

title: **Curse the Intruders** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([curse](rules/traits/curse.md), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md), [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md))

- **Trigger**: The seal on the tomb is [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) from the outside.

**Effect** Each living creature within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or be subjected to the pharaoh's curse. A cursed creature takes a â€“2 status penalty to Fortitude saves, and any natural or magical healing it receives is halved. The curse remains until removed by [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) or similar magic.
