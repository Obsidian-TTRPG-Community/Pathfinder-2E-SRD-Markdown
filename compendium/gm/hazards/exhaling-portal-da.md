# Exhaling Portal *Hazard 9*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** DC 33  

Magic runes carved into a doorframe connect a door to the Plane of Air when opened, blowing creatures down the connecting hall.

- **Disable** DC 30 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (expert) twice to scratch out the runes, or dispel magic (5th level; counteract DC 30) to counteract the planar runes; DC 32 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) to shut the door if it's open (using [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) only stops the trap, it doesn't fully disable it)  
     
```ad-embed-ability
title: Gust [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[air](rules/traits/air.md)  [conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md)  

- **Trigger**: A creature opens the door

**Effect** The hall is buffeted by powerful winds for as long as the door remains open. A creature must succeed at a DC 32 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to move toward the door. A creature who fails at this check is pushed back 5 feet and falls [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).

Additionally, the triggering creature is blasted by a powerful gust of wind and must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save. The trap then rolls initiative.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is pushed back 5 feet.
> - **Failure** The creature is pushed back 10 feet.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is pushed back 10 feet and knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(1 action) The trap uses 1 action to blow powerful winds down the hall. Each creature in the hall must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save with the same results as Gust. If this forced movement would cause a creature to collide with a solid object or fall downstairs or out a window, that creature takes an additional `2d10+11` bludgeoning damage (or 20 damage due to a fall).
```
^routine

**Reset** Automatic after the door is shut
