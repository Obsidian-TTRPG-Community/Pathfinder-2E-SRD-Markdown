# Confounding Portal *Hazard 0*  
[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 16  

Tiny runes carved around a doorframe or on a hall's walls surreptitiously confound creatures into circling the room or hallway they attempted to exit or pass through.

- **Disable** DC 17 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) to scratch out the runes, or DC 16 [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) to destroy the runes

title: **Confounding Misdirection** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md), [mental](rules/traits/mental.md))

- **Trigger**: A creature passes through the rune-carved doorway or hallway

**Effect** The creature is [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused) by the illusions and directed back into the room they attempted to exit through another doorway or back to the hallway's beginning. This feels no different to the triggering creature than walking through the doorway or hallway, and onlookers are similarly befuddled. A creature who succeeds at a DC 19 Will save resists this illusion and exits the room or proceeds down the hall without being misdirected.
