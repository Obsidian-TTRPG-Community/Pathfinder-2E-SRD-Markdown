```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(3 actions) The hazard loses 1 action for each crystal that's disabled or destroyed. On each of the trap's actions, one of the crystals fires a blast of sound at a single Small or larger creature in the room. The target is randomly determined and takes `1d8` sonic damage (DC 20 basic Fortitude save); a target who critically fails this save is [deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 minute. At the end of the hazard's routine, attempt a DC 10 flat check. On a success, one of the crystals shatters and is destroyed.
