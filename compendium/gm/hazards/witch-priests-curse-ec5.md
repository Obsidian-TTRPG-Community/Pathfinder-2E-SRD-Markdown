# Witch-priests' Curse *Hazard 18*  
[curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 42 expert  

Anyone who opens a secret compartment is subjected to a powerful curse.

- **Disable** DC 39 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (legendary) to carefully remove the bone fetish that holds the curse.

title: **Hex of the Bloody Thief** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([curse](rules/traits/curse.md), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md), [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md))

- **Trigger**: A creature opens a secret compartment

**Effect** The creature must succeed at a DC 38 Will save or be subjected to the witch-priests' curse. Whenever a cursed creature takes at least 10 piercing or slashing damage from a single attack, it also takes `3d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). In addition, the cursed creature regains only half as many Hit Points as normal from all healing. The effect is permanent unless removed by magic.
