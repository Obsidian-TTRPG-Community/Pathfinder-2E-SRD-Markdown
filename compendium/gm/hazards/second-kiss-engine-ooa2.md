# Second Kiss Engine *Hazard 6*  
[mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple

Exposed clockwork gears spin at high speeds.

- **Disable** DC 28 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (expert) to disable the engine, or DC 26 [Engineering Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) to disengage the drive shaft. Either method disables the trap but also shuts down the engine, disabling the Second Kiss's propulsion.  

- **AC** 27 , **Fort** +15, **Ref** +18
- **Hardness** 10, **HP** 50 (BT 25)
- **Immunities** critical hits; object immunities; precision damage
- **Resistances** 
- **Weaknesses**

title: Spinning Gears [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature [Strides](rules/actions/stride.md) in the engine nacelle

**Effect** The creature's clothing or limbs get caught in the spinning gears and axles of the engine. The creature must attempt a DC 24 Reflex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes `2d8+9` bludgeoning damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes `4d8+18` bludgeoning damage.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature's clothing is pulled into the clockworks. The creature takes `4d8+18` bludgeoning damage and is [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained). Until the creature Escapes (DC 24), it takes `2d8+9` bludgeoning damage each round as it's pulled into the spinning rotors. A creature wearing clothing can automatically [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) by doffing its caught clothing; this destroys the doffed clothing.
