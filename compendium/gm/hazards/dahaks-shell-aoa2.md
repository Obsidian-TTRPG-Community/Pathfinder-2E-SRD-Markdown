# Dahak's Shell *Hazard 12*  
[magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  [unique](rules/traits/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** +0 or [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md)  

A ring of eight [dragon pillar](compendium/gm/hazards/dragon-pillar-aoa2.md) replicas mark the border of a dome of magical prismatic energy that entirely contains the Fortress of Sorrow.

- **Disable** Each [dragon pillar](compendium/gm/hazards/dragon-pillar-aoa2.md) that is destroyed removes the corresponding color's effect from [Dahak](compendium/setting/deities/dahak-logm.md)'s shell; as long as even one color remains active, the pillars marking the shell's border cannot be damaged themselves, but a successful DC 32 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (master) check or a successful [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) (6th level; counteract DC 30) against one of the eight pillars can cause a randomly determined active color in the shell defense (below) to become deactivated for `1d4` rounds.

- **Trigger**: a creature attempts and fails to disable one of the shell colors via [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) or [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md)

**Effect** [Dahak](compendium/setting/deities/dahak-logm.md)'s shell [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) the triggering creature with a random eye beam. Roll `1d8` to determine the color (1–red, 2–orange, 3–yellow, 4–green, 5–blue, 6–indigo, 7–violet, 8–black).

When a creature physically passes through the shell, the creature is affected simultaneously by all colors of energy currently active in the shell; apply these effects in the following order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, black. These effects are the same as that of the eye beams described in [dragon pillar](compendium/gm/hazards/dragon-pillar-aoa2.md), but with a save DC of 32. Each effect requires its own save.
