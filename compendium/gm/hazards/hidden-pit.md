title: **Pitfall** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A creature walks onto the trapdoor.

**Effect** The triggering creature falls in and takes falling damage (typically 10 bludgeoning damage). That creature can use the [Grab an Edge](rules/actions/grab-an-edge.md) reaction to avoid falling.
```

**Reset** Creatures can still fall into the trap, but the trapdoor must be reset manually for the trap to become [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) again.
