# Shuffling Scythe Blades *Hazard 8*  
[complex](rules/traits/complex.md "Complex Hazard Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [trap](rules/traits/trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** DC 18 expert  

Six long blades, [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) in grooves in the walls and floor, zigzag through different parts of this hallway when any pressure plate in the hallway intersection is depressed; there are so many plates it's impossible to avoid them when moving through the room. The blades retreat into the floor and move through the [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) grooves before swinging out from the wall again in a different location.

- **Disable** DC 26 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (expert) to disable each blade, or utter the magical passphrase (which only Chafkhem knows) to deactivate the trap for 10 minutes.  

- **AC** 27, **Fort** +19, **Ref** +13

- **Trigger**: A creature steps in the 15-footby- 25-foot area where the branching hallways connect

**Effect** The trap uses Scythe Shuffle; each blade makes a scythe [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against each creature in its region, then it uses Scythe Shuffle again. The trap then rolls for initiative.

The blades travel erratically throughout the hallway's branches, out of sight under the floors or behind the walls. For each blade, roll `1d4` to determine the region in which it next makes scythe [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md). A creature can [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) (DC 22) to learn clues about blades in the region they're currently occupying. On a success, the creature knows how many blades are currently in its region.

1. Main intersection (the 15-foot-by-25-foot area where the hallways connect, as marked on area B20) 2. North branch (from the main intersection to the secret door to area B14) 3. Central hall (from the main intersection to the secret door to area B24) 4. South branch (from the main intersection to the wall shared with area B25)
