[complex](rules/traits/complex.md)  [environmental](rules/traits/environmental.md)  [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** +20 expert  

A herd of deer exits the woods to investigate the delicious-looking leshys.

- **Disable** DC 17 [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) (with wild empathy) to befriend the deer and convince them that leshys aren't for nibbling, or DC 20 [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) to scare the dear away  

- **AC** 19 , **Fort** +12, **Ref** +14, **Will** +6
- **HP** 44 (if the grazing deer take this much damage, they aren't killed, but they do flee into the woods and don't return)
- **Immunities** 
- **Resistances** 
- **Weaknesses**

title: Approach and Taste [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: The PCs emerge from the forest's edge

**Effect** A deer approaches the party and attempts a nibble [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a randomly determined PC.

The grazing deer rolls initiative.
```

```ad-pf2-summary
title: Routine
(2 actions) The grazing deer takes one action to move about, and then one action to eagerly nibble at a randomly chosen PC. A character who spends three actions on their turn to [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) can avoid being nibbled by the grazing deer during the hazard's next turn. If all of the PCs do so, attempt a DC 5 flat checkâ€”on a success, the party escapes the deer and can proceed onward to Petalbrook, but they become delayed as a result of having to flee the pack of ravenous deer.
