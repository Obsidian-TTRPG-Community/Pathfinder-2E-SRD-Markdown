# Boastful Prince's Scourge
*Curse 7*  
[curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

Used as a punishment against the vain or the arrogant, this curse slowly transforms you into a frog in note just body, but mind as well.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 23 Will

**Effect** Your features slowly morph into that of a frog's as you grow a prominent vocal sac. You gain the [amphibious](rules/traits/amphibious-b1.md "Amphibious Creature Trait") trait and can breathe both air and water. You are [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) as long as you are under the effect of this curse, and you can't reduce your [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) value below 1.
```

## Tempting Curse

You transform fully, as [animal form](compendium/spells/animal-form.md), giving you the specific abilities of a frog. The duration of this casting is until you make your daily preparations, and you can't [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell. While you are under the effect of [animal form](compendium/spells/animal-form.md) due to this curse, you have all the usual limitations of [animal form](compendium/spells/animal-form.md), including the fact that you can't speak (though you can still understand any languages you know).
