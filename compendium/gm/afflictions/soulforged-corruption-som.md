# Soulforged Corruption
*Curse 1*  
[curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait")  [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  

A successful [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell, rather than ending this curse, reduces its stage by 1 (to a minimum of stage 1).

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC save against a [very hard](rules/tables/dc-adjustments.md) [DC of the curse's level](rules/tables/dcs-by-level.md) Will


## Stages

**Stage 1** You suffer the effects of your armament's corruption flaw. If you try to manifest the armament's essence form, you must attempt a DC 5 flat check. If you fail, only the normal form manifests, and you can't try to manifest that armament's essence form again that day (1 day)

**Stage 2** You suffer the effects of your armament's corruption flaw, and any attempt to activate the armament's essence form fails (1 day)

**Stage 3** You permanently destroy your soulforged armament. You can't have a new soulforged armament until you remove the curse entirely with the [purify soul path](compendium/spells/rituals/purify-soul-path-som.md) ritual (1 day)
