# Curse of Biting Swarms
*Curse 5*  
[curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

You emit a deathlike stench that attracts swarms of carrion-eating insects.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 20 Fortitude

**Effect** You smell like a charnel house, making it easy for creatures with scent to notice you; they gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) against you. Additionally, the first time you're exposed to sunlight each day, biting insects attack you, scattering once they've taken damage. You then become [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) until the next time you take a full night's rest. These conditions can't be reduced below 1 by other means.
