```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 37 Fortitude

Non-humans can't progress beyond Stage 1

- **Onset**: `1d6Ã—10` minutes

## Stages

**Stage 1** carrier with no symptoms, but anyone who touches or is touched by the carrier (skin-to-skin contact) must save against the curse (`1d4` days)

**Stage 2** The target dies and transforms into an ooze with a level no greater than the target's level plus 1 for each day since the target contracted the curse.
