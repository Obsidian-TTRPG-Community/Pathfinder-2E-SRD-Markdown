# Curse of Petulant Whispers
*Curse 2*  
[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait")  [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

A cruel, ghostly voice follows you, whispering your transgressions to anyone you encounter.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 16 Will

**Effect** Whenever you try to speak to another creature who doesn't know you well, they hear whispers in a language they understand that reveal hints and phrases related to the things about which you feel most guilty. You have a â€“2 circumstance bonus to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) against those creatures, and if you roll a failure on your check, you get a critical failure instead.
