# Swarming Words
*Curse 9*  
[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

Placed upon those who use magic to cause harm, this curse causes a shower of bugs to fall from your lips whenever you speak, foiling your spellcasting.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 26 Will

**Effect** The crawling within your mouth never stops as cockroaches, ants, and other insects nest in your body. Whenever you attempt to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with a verbal component or otherwise use an activity that has the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") trait, you must attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a failure, the insects counteract your activity as they crowd your mouth and muffle the sound.
```

## Tempting Curse

The insects multiply into a cascade. When you activate the tempted curse, you must spend 2 actions to cast a 5th-level vomit swarm to free the vermin inside you. For 1 minute after unleashing the swarm, you are not affected by the curse, but afterward, the swarming worsens. For the rest of the day, whenever you attempt to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with a verbal component or otherwise use an activity that has the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") trait, you must attempt a DC 10 flat check. On a failure, the insects counteract your activity.
