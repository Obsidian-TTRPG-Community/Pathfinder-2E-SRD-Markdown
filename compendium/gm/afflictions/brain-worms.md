# Brain Worms
*Disease 11*  
[disease](rules/traits/disease.md "Disease Effect Trait")  [virulent](rules/traits/virulent.md "Virulent Item Trait")  

Scholars suspect these brain parasites have an otherworldly or extraplanar origin. Though transmitted by the bites of infected targets, the disease remains relatively rareâ€”most hosts are killed by the effects before they can pass it on. While infected, whenever you attack due to confusion, you bite your target (if you don't have a jaws or fangs attack, you deal piercing damage as an unarmed attack with damage equal to your lowest unarmed attack).
