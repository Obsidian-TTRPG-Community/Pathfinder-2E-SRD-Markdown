# Sellsword's Folly
*Curse 9*  
[curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait")  [emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

Even the most experienced combat veteran becomes as reckless as a rookie when suffering from sellsword's folly.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 26 Will

**Effect** The chaos of combat overwhelms you. Each time you roll initiative for a combat encounter, you must attempt a new saving throw against the curse; on a failure, you become [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused) for 1 round. This is an [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait") effect.
