You're filled with the unearned confidence of a young noble and carry yourself as if you can do no wrong.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 23 Will

**Effect** Whenever you make a [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) check or a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check that would give you information (such as to [Sense Motive](rules/actions/sense-motive.md)), you always receive at least one piece of false information that you believe with absolute confidence, even on a success or better. If you attempt to act on this false information, you receive a â€“1 circumstance penalty on any skill checks you attempt.
