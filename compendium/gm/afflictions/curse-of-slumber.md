# Curse of Slumber
*Curse 11*  
[curse](rules/traits/curse.md "Curse Effect Trait")  [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [sleep](rules/traits/sleep.md "Sleep Effect Trait")  

This legendary curse sends you into a sleep indistinguishable from death.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 28 Fortitude

**Effect** You fall asleep for 1 round (or permanently on a critical failure) and seem to be dead; a creature must succeed at a DC 30 [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check to realize you are alive. Noise doesn't awaken you, but taking damage gives you a new saving throw against the curse.
```
