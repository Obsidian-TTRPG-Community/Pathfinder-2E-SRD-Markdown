# Blightburn Sickness
*Disease Level Varies*  

Caused by exposure to blightburn crystal, blightburn sickness burns and dissolves the afflicted creature from within. The target can't recover from the disease's [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) or [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition except by magic. It's typically a 15th-level affliction (DC 32 Fortitude), but exposure to other forms of blightburn can change it.
