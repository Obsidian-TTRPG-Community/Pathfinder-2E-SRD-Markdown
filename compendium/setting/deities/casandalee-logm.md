## Divine intercession
*Source: Lost Omens: Gods & Magic Web Supplement p. 4*

Seeing her android devotees and other followers of a constructed nature as her children, the Iron Goddess is most likely to bestow her boons and curses on these individuals.

- **Minor Boon** Casandalee frees your thinking from dangerous control. Once, when you fail a Will save against an effect that would control your actions, you critically succeed instead. Casandalee typically grants this boon for particularly consequential violations of autonomy and agency.
- **Moderate Boon**: Your organs are partially transformed into mechanical counterparts. You gain resistance 10 to negative damage, and the DC of your flat check to remove [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) is only 5.
- **Major Boon**: Casandalee backs up your memory and soul within her divine data flow. After you die, she casts your consciousness into a new artificial body. While Casandalee constructed your new body artificially, it is otherwise similar to the old, with the same effects as a critical success on a resurrection ritual. Casandalee is instead willing to provide different bodies to those who request them.

- **Minor Curse**: Your joints stiffen, and your mind becomes clouded. You take a â€“2 status penalty to all rolls for initiative.
- **Moderate Curse** Casandalee attempts to bring you unwanted intellectual advancement to help you become something better. Each day, at some point during the day, Casandalee bestows a strange insight upon you that you find uncomfortable. If you embrace it, you aren't otherwise affected, but if you don't, you become [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused) for 10 minutes.
- **Major Curse**: The code of your soul is constantly being rewritten, and not for the better. You are never temporarily immune against a harmful effect.
