Though the Weaver often condones bad decisions so long as a lesson is learned, and is even willing to accept being fairly tricked herself, cruelty and predation upon the weak draw her outrage.

- **Minor Boon** Grandmother Spider rescues your prank from the jaws of failure. Once, when you would fail a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check, you critically succeed instead. Grandmother Spider typically grants this boon for deceptions that are necessary for an interesting or consequential prank.
- **Moderate Boon**: You can feel tugs on the strands of fate. You gain a +2 status bonus to initiative rolls.
- **Major Boon**: Grandmother Spider rejoices in freedom and tricks those who would limit it. Any time you would become [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained), attempt a DC 10 flat check. On a success, you ignore the effect, and the originator of the effect becomes [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) instead. If this simply causes a creature to grab itself, it can usually [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) as a free action, but it might be stuck if it tried to immobilize you in other ways.

- **Minor Curse**: When your pranks start going wrong, they dissolve into a string of catastrophic failures. When you roll a failure on a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check, you get a critical failure instead.
- **Moderate Curse** Grandmother Spider weaves a web to ensnare you, and you trail webs behind you wherever you go. You become permanently [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) and take a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to your Speeds.
- **Major Curse**: Grandmother Spider throws all of her might behind the underdog. Any time a creature with a level lower than yours rolls a success on a check against you, it critically succeeds instead; any time you roll a failure on a check against a creature with a level lower than yours, you critically fail instead.
