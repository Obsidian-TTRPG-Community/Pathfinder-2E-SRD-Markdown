## Divine intercession
*Source: Lost Omens: Gods & Magic p. 37*

Norgorber's favor and displeasure are subtle, yet powerful.

- **Minor Boon** Norgorber protects your secrets and lies. Once, when you roll a failure at a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check to tell a [Lie](rules/actions/lie.md), you get a critical success instead. Norgorber typically chooses to grant this boon to protect an extremely consequential lie.
- **Moderate Boon**: Your poisons are everlasting. If your [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a poisoned weapon critically fails, or succeeds but fails to deal slashing or piercing damage, the poison is not spent. The poison is still spent once successfully applied to a creature.
- **Major Boon**: You become a living secret. You are immune to [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait") effects and attempts to magically alter your memory, unless you choose to be affected or those effects come from a deity, artifact, or similarly powerful source. You also can never be tricked or forced by mundane means into uttering a secret you wish to keep.

- **Minor Curse**: Norgorber allows thieves to get the better of you. Whenever you [Earn Income](rules/actions/earn-income.md), you earn money as if the task were 2 levels lower due to theft, loss, or bad fortune.
- **Moderate Curse** Poisons are quick to debilitate you. When you roll a failure at a Fortitude save against a poison, you get a critical failure instead.
- **Major Curse**: Norgorber steals away your memories. Once each day when you awake from rest, roll `1d4`. On a 1, you forget the events of the previous day forever. On a 2, you temporarily experience complete retrograde amnesia for that day, unable to recall information from the past, including who you are. On a 3, you temporarily forget a single important subject for that day (Norgorber tends to intentionally chooses a memory to cause distress, such as making you forget your spouse on your anniversary). On a 4, you temporarily remember false memories on a single important subject for that day, blended seamlessly into your true memories.
