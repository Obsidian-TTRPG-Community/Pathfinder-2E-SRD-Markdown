## Divine intercession
*Source: Lost Omens: Gods & Magic Web Supplement p. 7*

The Everbloom rewards those who put the needs of others first, especially when combating oppressive forces, and she doesn't hesitate to impede any who enslave others or persecute the defenseless.

- **Minor Boon** Once, when you roll a failure on a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check to protect an uprising from discovery, you critically succeed instead. Milani typically grants this boon for extremely significant checks on which the uprising's survival hinges.
- **Moderate Boon**: When you use it to protect others, your shield blooms with roses brimming with razor-sharp thorns. You gain the Shield Warden feat, even if you don't meet its prerequisites. If you already had that feat, if your shield takes damage from a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) in defense of your ally, the attacker takes piercing damage equal to half the shield's Hardness.
- **Major Boon**: You gain +4 status bonus to checks to [Request](rules/actions/request.md) during attempts to satisfy one of Milani's edicts. Once per day, you can sound a battle cry that grants creatures within a 30-foot emanation the effects of [freedom of movement](compendium/spells/freedom-of-movement.md) and affects all doors, locks, containers, and other bindings used to restrain or imprison others with the effects of the [knock](compendium/spells/knock.md) spell.

- **Minor Curse**: A magical wreath of thorny, blood-red roses endlessly grows from your scalp, no matter how much you try to remove it. You gain weakness 5 to piercing damage.
- **Moderate Curse** Ropes, chains, manacles, and other equipment used to bind or constrain become blazing hot in your hands, bursting into flame or melting as if engulfed in a forge. When you attempt to hold such an item, you take `2d6` fire damage and the item is destroyed.
- **Major Curse**: Small wounds bleed more than seems physically possible. Whenever you take slashing or piercing damage, you also take [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to the level of the creature or effect that inflicted the damage.
