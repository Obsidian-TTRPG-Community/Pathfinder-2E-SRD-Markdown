# Chapter 6: Equipment
<sup>CRB p. 271</sup>

Your character starts out with 15 gold pieces (150 silver pieces) to spend on any common items from this chapter. Items with an uncommon rarity can be purchased only if you have special access from abilities you selected during character creation or your GM gives you permission to purchase them.

Once you've purchased your starting items, there are three main ways to gain new items and equipment: you can find them during an adventure, make them using the [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) skill, or purchase them from a merchant.

## Coins and Currency
<sup>CRB p. 271</sup>

Though you might be able to barter valuable items in some areas, currency is the most versatile way to make transactions when you head to market. The most common currency is coins. For most commoners and beginning adventurers, the standard unit is the **silver piece** (**sp**). Each silver piece is a standard weight of silver and is typically accepted by any merchant or kingdom no matter where it was minted. There are three other common types of coins, each likewise standardized in weight and value. The first is the **copper piece** (**cp**). Each copper piece is worth one-tenth of a silver piece. The **gold piece** (**gp**) is often used for purchasing magic items and other expensive items, as 1 gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces or 100 copper pieces. The **platinum piece** (**pp**) is used by nobles to demonstrate their wealth, for the purchase of very expensive items, or simply as a way to easily transport large sums of currency. A platinum piece is worth 10 gold pieces, 100 silver pieces, or 1,000 copper pieces. See [Table 6–1: Coin Values](rules/tables/coin-values.md) for the exchange rates of common types of coins.

### Other Currency
<sup>CRB p. 271</sup>

Art objects, gems, and raw materials (such as those used for the [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) activity) can be used much like currency: you can sell them for the same Price you can buy them.

## Price
<sup>CRB p. 271</sup>

Most items in the following tables have a Price, which is the amount of currency it typically takes to purchase that item. An item with a Price of "—" can't be purchased. An item with a Price of 0 is normally free, but its value could be higher based on the materials used to create it. Most items can be sold for half their Price, but coins, gems, art objects, and raw materials (such as components for the Craft activity) can be exchanged for their full Price.

![Coin Values](rules/tables/coin-values.md)

## Item Level
<sup>CRB p. 271</sup>

Each item has an item level, which represents the item's complexity and any magic used in its construction. Simpler items with a lower level are easier to construct, and you can't Craft items that have a higher level than your own (page 243). If an item's level isn't listed, its level is 0. While characters can use items of any level, GMs should keep in mind that allowing characters access to items far above their current level may have a negative impact on the game.

## Carrying and Using Items
<sup>CRB p. 271</sup>

A character carries items in three ways: held, worn, and stowed. Held items are in your hands; a character typically has two hands, allowing them to hold an item in each hand or a single two-handed item using both hands. Worn items are tucked into pockets, belt pouches, bandoliers, weapon sheaths, and so forth, and they can be retrieved and returned relatively quickly. Stowed items are in a backpack or a similar container, and they are more difficult to access.

Drawing a worn item or changing how you're carrying an item usually requires you to use an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action (though to drop an item, you use the [Release](rules/actions/release.md) action instead). [Table 6–2: Changing Equipment](rules/tables/changing-equipment.md) lists some ways that you might change the items you're holding or carrying, and the number of hands you need to do so.

Many ways of using items require you to spend multiple actions. For example, drinking a potion stowed in your belt pouch requires using an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to draw it and then using a second action to drink it as described in its [Activate](rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) entry.

### Bulk
<sup>CRB p. 271</sup>

Carrying especially heavy or unwieldy items can make it more difficult for you to move, as can overloading yourself with too much gear. The Bulk value of an item reflects how difficult the item is to handle, representing its size, weight, and general awkwardness. If you have a high Strength score, you usually don't need to worry about Bulk unless you're carrying numerous substantial items.

#### Bulk Limits
<sup>CRB p. 272</sup>

You can carry an amount of Bulk equal to 5 plus your Strength modifier without penalty; if you carry more, you gain the encumbered condition. You can't hold or carry more Bulk than 10 plus your Strength modifier.

> [!pf2-beige] Encumbered
> 
> You are carrying more weight than you can manage. While you're [encumbered](rules/conditions.md#Encumbered), you're [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) and take a –10-foot penalty to all your Speeds. As with all penalties to your Speed, this can't reduce your Speed below 5 feet.

#### Bulk Values
<sup>CRB p. 272</sup>

Items can have a number to indicate their Bulk value, or they can be light (indicated by an L) or negligible (indicated by a—) for the purpose of determining Bulk. For instance, [full plate](compendium/equipment/items/full-plate.md) armor is 4 Bulk, a [longsword](compendium/equipment/items/longsword.md) is 1 Bulk, a dagger or scroll is light, and a piece of chalk is negligible. Ten light items count as 1 Bulk, and you round down fractions (so 9 light items count as 0 Bulk, and 11 light items count as 1 Bulk). Items of negligible Bulk don't count toward Bulk unless you try to carry vast numbers of them, as determined by the GM.

#### Estimating an Item's Bulk
<sup>CRB p. 272</sup>

As a general rule, an item that weighs 5 to 10 pounds is 1 Bulk, an item weighing less than a few ounces is negligible, and anything in between is light. Particularly awkward or unwieldy items might have higher Bulk values. For example, a 10-foot pole isn't heavy, but its length makes it difficult for you to move while you have one on your person, so its Bulk is 1. Items made for larger or smaller creatures have greater or lesser Bulk, as described on page 295.

#### Bulk of Coins
<sup>CRB p. 272</sup>

Coins are a popular means of exchange due to their portability, but they can still add up. A thousand coins of any denomination or combination of denominations count as 1 Bulk. It's not usually necessary to determine the Bulk of coins in fractions of 1,000; simply round down fractions of 1,000. In other words, 100 coins don't count as a light item, and 1,999 coins are 1 Bulk, not 2.

#### Bulk of Creatures
<sup>CRB p. 272</sup>

You might need to know the Bulk of a creature, especially if you need to carry someone off the battlefield. The table that follows lists the typical Bulk of a creature based on its size, but the GM might adjust this number.

| Size of Creature | Bulk |
|------------------|------|
| [Tiny](rules/traits/tiny-b1.md "Tiny Size Trait") | 1 |
| [Small](rules/traits/small-b1.md "Small Size Trait") | 3 |
| [Medium](rules/traits/medium-b1.md "Medium Size Trait") | 6 |
| [Large](rules/traits/large-b1.md "Large Size Trait") | 12 |
| [Huge](rules/traits/huge-b1.md "Huge Size Trait") | 24 |
| [Gargantuan](rules/traits/gargantuan-b1.md "Gargantuan Size Trait") | 48 |

#### Dragging
<sup>CRB p. 272</sup>

In some situations, you might drag an object or creature rather than carry it. If you're dragging something, treat its Bulk as half. Typically, you can drag one thing at a time, you must use both hands to do so, and you drag slowly—roughly 50 feet per minute unless you have some means to speed it up. Use the total Bulk of what you're dragging, so if you have a sack laden with goods, use the sum of all the Bulk it carries instead of an individual item within.

### Wielding Items
<sup>CRB p. 272</sup>

Some abilities require you to wield an item, typically a weapon. You're wielding an item any time you're holding it in the number of hands needed to use it effectively. When wielding an item, you're not just carrying it around—you're ready to use it. Other abilities might require you to merely carry or have an item. These apply as long as you have the item on your person; you don't have to wield it.

![Changing Equipment](rules/tables/changing-equipment.md)

## Item Damage
<sup>CRB p. 272</sup>

An item can be broken or destroyed if it takes enough damage. Every item has a **Hardness** value. Each time an item takes damage, reduce any damage the item takes by its Hardness. The rest of the damage reduces the item's Hit Points. Normally an item takes damage only when a creature is directly attacking it—commonly targeted items include doors and traps. A creature that attacks you doesn't normally damage your armor or other gear, even if it hits you. However, the [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) reaction can cause your shield to take damage as you use it to prevent damage to yourself, and some monsters have exceptional abilities that can damage your items.

An item that takes damage can become and eventually destroyed. It becomes broken when its Hit Points are equal to or lower than its **Broken Threshold** (**BT**); once its Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is **destroyed**. A broken item has the broken condition until Repaired above its Broken Threshold. Anything that automatically makes an item broken immediately reduces its Hit Points to its Broken Threshold if the item had more Hit Points than that when the effect occurred. If an item has no [Broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) Threshold, then it has no relevant changes to its function due to being broken, but it's still destroyed at 0 Hit Points. (See the broken condition definition on page 273 for more information.) A destroyed item can't be Repaired.

An item's Hardness, Hit Points, and [Broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) Threshold usually depend on the material the item is made of. This information appears in the 11 section of 11.

> [!pf2-beige] Broken
> 
> Broken is a condition that affects objects. An object is broken when damage has reduced its Hit Points to equal or less than its Broken Threshold. A broken object can't be used for its normal function, nor does it grant bonuses—with the exception of armor. Broken armor still grants its item bonus to AC, but it also imparts a status penalty to AC depending on its category: –1 for broken light armor, –2 for broken medium armor, or –3 for broken heavy armor.
> 
> A broken item still imposes penalties and limitations normally incurred by carrying, holding, or wearing it. For example, broken armor would still impose its Dexterity modifier cap, check penalty, and so forth.
> 
> If an effect makes an item broken automatically and the item has more HP than its Broken Threshold, that effect also reduces the item's current HP to the Broken Threshold.

### Object Immunities
<sup>CRB p. 273</sup>

Inanimate objects and hazards are immune to bleed, death effects, disease, healing, mental effects, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, and poison, as well as the doomed, drained, fatigued, paralyzed, sickened, and unconscious conditions. An item that has a mind is not immune to mental effects. Many objects are immune to other conditions, at the GM's discretion. For instance, a sword has no Speed, so it can't take a penalty to its Speed, but an effect that causes a Speed penalty might work on a moving blade trap.

## Shoddy Items
<sup>CRB p. 273</sup>

Improvised or of dubious make, shoddy items are never available for purchase except for in the most desperate of communities. When available, a shoddy item usually costs half the Price of a standard item, though you can never sell one in any case. Attacks and checks involving a shoddy item take a –2 item penalty. This penalty also applies to any DCs that a shoddy item applies to (such as AC, for shoddy armor). A shoddy suit of armor also worsens the armor's check penalty by 2. A shoddy item's Hit Points and Broken Threshold are each half that of a normal item of its type.

## Armor
<sup>CRB p. 274</sup>

### Armor Class
<sup>CRB p. 274</sup>

Your **Armor Class** (**AC**) measures how well you can defend against attacks. When a creature attacks you, your Armor Class is the DC for that attack roll.

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Armor Class = 10 + Dexterity modifier (up to your armor's Dex Cap) + proficiency bonus + armor's item bonus to AC + other bonuses + penalties

Use your proficiency bonus for the category (light, medium, or heavy) or the specific type of armor you're wearing. If you're not wearing armor, use your proficiency in unarmored defense.

### Donning and Removing Armor
<sup>CRB p. 274</sup>

Getting in and out of armor is time consuming—so make sure you're wearing it when you need it! Donning and removing armor are both activities involving many Interact actions. It takes 1 minute to don light armor, 5 minutes to don medium or heavy armor, and 1 minute to remove any armor.

### Armor Statistics
<sup>CRB p. 274</sup>

[Table 6–3: Unarmored Defense](rules/tables/unarmored-defense.md) provides the statistics for the various forms of protection without wearing armor. [Table 6–4: Armor](rules/tables/armor.md) provides the statistics for suits of armor that can be purchased and worn, organized by category. The columns in both tables provide the following statistics.

#### Category
<sup>CRB p. 274</sup>

The armor's category—unarmored, light armor, medium armor, or heavy armor—indicates which proficiency bonus you use while wearing the armor.

#### AC Bonus
<sup>CRB p. 274</sup>

This number is the item bonus you add for the armor when determining Armor Class.

#### Dexterity Modifier Cap (Dex Cap)
<sup>CRB p. 274</sup>

This number is the maximum amount of your Dexterity modifier that can apply to your AC while you are wearing a given suit of armor. For example, if you have a Dexterity modifier of +4 and you are wearing a suit of half plate, you apply only a +1 bonus from your Dexterity modifier to your AC while wearing that armor.

#### Check Penalty
<sup>CRB p. 274</sup>

While wearing your armor, you take this penalty to Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks, except for those that have the attack trait. If you meet the armor's Strength threshold (see Strength below), you don't take this penalty.

#### Speed Penalty
<sup>CRB p. 274</sup>

While wearing a suit of armor, you take the penalty listed in this entry to your Speed, as well as to any other movement types you have, such as a climb Speed or swim Speed, to a minimum Speed of 5 feet. If you meet the armor's Strength threshold (see below), you reduce the penalty by 5 feet.

#### Strength
<sup>CRB p. 274</sup>

This entry indicates the Strength score at which you are strong enough to overcome some of the armor's penalties. If your Strength is equal to or greater than this value, you no longer take the armor's check penalty, and you decrease the Speed penalty by 5 feet (to no penalty if the penalty was –5 feet, or to a –5-foot penalty if the penalty was –10 feet).

#### Bulk
<sup>CRB p. 274</sup>

This entry gives the armor's Bulk, assuming you're wearing the armor and distributing its weight across your body. A suit of armor that's carried or worn usually has 1 more Bulk than what's listed here (or 1 Bulk total for armor of light Bulk). An armor's Bulk is increased or decreased if it's sized for creatures that aren't Small or Medium in size, following the rules on page 295.

#### Group
<sup>CRB p. 274</sup>

Each type of medium and heavy armor belongs to an armor group, which classifies it with similar types of armor. Some abilities reference armor groups, typically to grant armor specialization effects, which are described on page 275.

#### Armor Traits
<sup>CRB p. 274</sup>

The traits for each suit of armor appear in this entry.

Armor can have the following traits.

**[Bulwark](rules/traits/bulwark.md "Bulwark Armor Trait"):** The armor covers you so completely that it provides benefits against some damaging effects. On Reflex saves to avoid a damaging effect, such as a [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md), you add a +3 modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier.

**[Comfort](rules/traits/comfort.md "Comfort Armor Trait"):** The armor is so comfortable that you can rest normally while wearing it.

**[Flexible](rules/traits/flexible.md "Flexible Armor Trait"):** The armor is flexible enough that it doesn't hinder most actions. You don't apply its check penalty to [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks.

**[Noisy](rules/traits/noisy.md "Noisy Armor Trait"):** This armor is loud and likely to alert others to your presence when you're using the [Avoid Notice](rules/actions/avoid-notice.md) exploration activity.

#### Armor Specialization Effects
<sup>CRB p. 275</sup>

Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.

**Chain:** The armor is so flexible it can bend with a critical hit and absorb some of the blow. Reduce the damage from critical hits by either 4 + the value of the armor's potency rune for medium armor, or 6 + the value of the armor's potency rune for heavy armor. This can't reduce the damage to less than the damage rolled for the hit before doubling for a critical hit.

**Composite:** The numerous overlapping pieces of this armor protect you from piercing attacks. You gain resistance to piercing damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor's potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor's potency rune for heavy armor.

**Leather:** The thick second skin of the armor disperses blunt force to reduce bludgeoning damage. You gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor's potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor's potency rune for heavy armor.

**Plate:** The sturdy plate provides no purchase for a cutting edge. You gain resistance to slashing damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor's potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor's potency rune for heavy armor.

![Unarmored Defense](rules/tables/unarmored-defense.md)

![Armor](rules/tables/armor.md)

> [!pf2-brown] MATERIALS
> 
> Most suits of armor and weapons are made from ordinary, commonly available materials like iron, leather, steel, and wood. If you're not sure what a suit of armor is made of, the GM determines the details.
> 
> Some armor, shields, and weapons are instead made of precious materials. These often have inherent supernatural properties. Cold iron, for example, which harms fey, and silver can damage werecreatures. These materials are detailed beginning on page 577.

### Armor Descriptions
<sup>CRB p. 275</sup>

Each type of armor is described in more detail below.

**[Breastplate](compendium/equipment/items/breastplate.md):** Though referred to as a breastplate, this type of armor consists of several pieces of plate or half-plate armor (page 276) that protect the torso, chest, neck, and sometimes the hips and lower legs. It strategically grants some of the protection of plate while allowing greater flexibility and speed.

**[Chain Mail](compendium/equipment/items/chain-mail.md):** A suit of chain mail consists of several pieces of armor composed of small metal rings linked together in a protective mesh. It typically includes a chain shirt, leggings, a pair of arms, and a coif, collectively protecting most of the body.

**[Chain Shirt](compendium/equipment/items/chain-shirt.md):** Sometimes called a hauberk, this is a long shirt constructed of the same metal rings as chainmail. However, it is much lighter than chainmail and protects only the torso, upper arms, and upper legs of its wearer.

**[Explorer's Clothing](compendium/equipment/items/explorers-clothing.md):** Adventurers who don't wear armor travel in durable clothing. Though it's not armor and uses your unarmored defense proficiency, it still has a Dex Cap and can grant an item bonus to AC if etched with potency runes (as described on page 581).

**[Full Plate](compendium/equipment/items/full-plate.md):** Plate mail consists of interlocking plates that encase nearly the entire body in a carapace of steel. It is costly and heavy, and the wearer often requires help to don it correctly, but it provides some of the best defense armor can supply. A suit of this armor comes with an undercoat of padded armor (see below) and a pair of gauntlets (page 285).

**[Half Plate](compendium/equipment/items/half-plate.md):** Half plate consists of most of the upper body plates used in full plate, with lighter or sparser steel plate protection for the arms and legs. This provides some of the protection of full plate with greater flexibility and speed. A suit of this armor comes with an undercoat of padded armor (see below) and a pair of gauntlets (page 285).

**[Hide](compendium/equipment/items/hide.md):** A mix of furs, sturdy hide, and sometimes molded boiled leather, this armor provides protection due to its layers of leather, though its bulkiness slows the wearer down and decreases mobility.

**[Leather](compendium/equipment/items/leather.md):** A mix of flexible and molded boiled leather, a suit of this type of armor provides some protection with maximum flexibility.

**[Padded Armor](compendium/equipment/items/padded-armor.md):** This armor is simply a layer of heavy, quilted cloth, but it is sometimes used because it's so inexpensive. Padded armor is easier to damage and destroy than other types of armor. Heavy armor comes with a padded armor undercoat included in its Price, though it loses the comfort trait when worn under heavy armor. You can wear just that padded armor undercoat to sleep in, if your heavy armor is destroyed, or when otherwise not wearing the full heavy armor. This allows you to keep the armor invested and benefit from the power of any runes on the associated heavy armor, but no one else can wear your heavy armor without the padded undercoat.

**[Scale Mail](compendium/equipment/items/scale-mail.md):** Scale mail consists of many metal scales sewn onto a reinforced leather backing, often in the form of a long shirt that protects the torso, arms, and legs.

**[Splint Mail](compendium/equipment/items/splint-mail.md):** This type of armor is chain mail reinforced with flexible, interlocking metal plates, typically located on the wearer's torso, upper arms, and legs. A suit of this armor comes with an undercoat of padded armor (see above) and a pair of gauntlets (page 285).

**[Studded Leather](compendium/equipment/items/studded-leather.md):** This leather armor is reinforced with metal studs and sometimes small metal plates, providing most of the flexibility of leather armor with more robust protection.

![Damaging Armor](rules/tables/damaging-armor.md)

## Shields
<sup>CRB p. 277</sup>

[Raise a Shield](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md) is the action most commonly used with shields. Most shields must be held in one hand, so you can't hold anything with that hand and [Raise a Shield](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md). A [buckler](compendium/equipment/items/buckler.md), however, doesn't take up your hand, so you can [Raise a Shield](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md) with a [buckler](compendium/equipment/items/buckler.md) if the hand is free (or, at the GM's discretion, if it's holding a simple, lightweight object that's not a weapon). You lose the benefits of [Raise a Shield](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md) if that hand is no longer free.

When you have a [tower shield](compendium/equipment/items/tower-shield.md) raised, you can use the [Take Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md) action to increase the circumstance bonus to AC to +4. This lasts until the shield is no longer raised. If you would normally provide lesser cover against an attack, having your tower shield raised provides standard cover against it (and other creatures can [Take Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md) as normal using the cover from your shield).

If you have access to the [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) reaction (from your class or from a feat), you can use it while [Raising your Shield](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md) to reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to the shield's Hardness. Both you and the shield then take any remaining damage.

### Shield Statistics
<sup>CRB p. 277</sup>

Shields have statistics that follow the same rules as armor:

Price, Speed Penalty, and Bulk. See page 274 for the rules for those statistics. Their other statistics are described here.

#### AC Bonus
<sup>CRB p. 277</sup>

A shield grants a circumstance bonus to AC, but only when the shield is raised. This requires using the Raise a Shield action, found on page 472.

#### Hardness
<sup>CRB p. 277</sup>

Whenever a shield takes damage, the amount of damage it takes is reduced by this amount. This number is particularly relevant for shields because of the [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) feat (page 266). The rules for Hardness appear on page 272.

#### HP (BT)
<sup>CRB p. 277</sup>

This column lists the shield's Hit Points (HP) and Broken Threshold (BT). These measure how much damage the shield can take before it's destroyed (its total HP) and how much it can take before being broken and unusable (its BT). These matter primarily for the [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) reaction.

![Shields](rules/tables/shields.md)

### Attacking with a Shield
<sup>CRB p. 277</sup>

A shield can be used as a martial weapon for attacks, using the statistics listed for a shield bash on [Table 6–7: Melee Weapons](rules/tables/melee-weapons.md). The shield bash is an option only for shields that weren't designed to be used as weapons. A shield can't have runes added to it. You can also buy and attach a [shield boss](compendium/equipment/items/shield-boss.md) or [shield spikes](compendium/equipment/items/shield-spikes.md) to a shield to make it a more practical weapon. These can be found on [Table 6–7](rules/tables/melee-weapons.md). These work like other weapons and can even be etched with runes.

### Shield Descriptions
<sup>CRB p. 277</sup>

Each type of shield is described in more detail below.

**[Buckler](compendium/equipment/items/buckler.md):** This very small shield is a favorite of duelists and quick, lightly armored warriors. It's typically made of steel and strapped to your forearm. You can Raise a Shield with your buckler as long as you have that hand free or are holding a light object that's not a weapon in that hand.

**[Wooden Shield](compendium/equipment/items/wooden-shield.md):** Though they come in a variety of shapes and sizes, the protection offered by wooden shields comes from the stoutness of their materials. While wooden shields are less expensive than steel shields, they break more easily.

**[Steel Shield](compendium/equipment/items/steel-shield.md):** Like wooden shields, steel shields come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Though more expensive than wooden shields, they are much more durable.

**[Tower Shield](compendium/equipment/items/tower-shield.md):** These massive shields can be used to provide cover to nearly the entire body. Due to their size, they are typically made of wood reinforced with metal.

## Weapons
<sup>CRB p. 278</sup>

### Attack Rolls
<sup>CRB p. 278</sup>

When making an attack roll, determine the result by rolling 1d20 and adding your attack modifier for the weapon or unarmed attack you're using. Modifiers for melee and ranged attacks are calculated differently.

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Ranged attack modifier = Dexterity modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Melee attack modifier = Strength modifier (or optionally Dexterity for a [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait") weapon) + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties

Bonuses, and penalties apply to these rolls just like with other types of checks. Weapons with potency runes (page 581) add an item bonus to your attack rolls.

#### Multiple Attack Penalty
<sup>CRB p. 278</sup>

If you use an action with the attack trait more than once on the same turn, your attacks after the first take a penalty called a multiple attack penalty. Your second attack takes a –5 penalty, and any subsequent attacks take a –10 penalty.

The multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to attacks you make when it isn't your turn (such as attacks made as part of a reaction). You can use a weapon with the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait") trait to reduce your multiple attack penalty.

### Damage Rolls
<sup>CRB p. 278</sup>

When the result of your attack roll with a weapon or unarmed attack equals or exceeds your target's AC, you hit your target! Roll the weapon or unarmed attack's damage die and add the relevant modifiers, bonuses, and penalties to determine the amount of damage you deal. Calculate a damage roll as follows.

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Melee damage roll = damage die of weapon or unarmed attack + Strength modifier + bonuses + penalties

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Ranged damage roll = damage die of weapon + Strength modifier for thrown weapons + bonuses + penalties

Ranged weapons don't normally add an ability modifier to the damage roll, though weapons with the propulsive trait (page 283) add half your Strength modifier (or your full modifier if it is a negative number), and thrown weapons add your full Strength modifier.

Magic weapons with [striking](compendium/equipment/items/striking.md), greater striking, or major striking runes (page 581) add one or more weapon damage dice to your damage roll. These extra dice are the same die size as the weapon's damage die. At higher levels, most characters also gain extra damage from weapon specialization.

### Critical Hits
<sup>CRB p. 278</sup>

When you make an attack and succeed with a natural 20 (the number on the die is 20), or if the result of your attack exceeds the target's AC by 10, you achieve a critical success (also known as a critical hit).

If you critically succeed at a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), your attack deals 9. Other attacks, such as spell attack rolls and some uses of the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill, describe the specific effects that occur when their outcomes are critical successes.

### Unarmed Attacks
<sup>CRB p. 278</sup>

Almost all characters start out trained in unarmed attacks. You can [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with your fist or another body part, calculating your attack and damage rolls in the same way you would with a weapon. Unarmed attacks can belong to a weapon group (page 280), and they might have weapon traits (page 282). However, unarmed attacks aren't weapons, and effects and abilities that work with weapons never work with unarmed attacks unless they specifically say so.

[Table 6–6: Unarmed Attacks](rules/tables/unarmed-attacks.md) lists the statistics for an unarmed attack with a fist, though you'll usually use the same statistics for attacks made with any other parts of your body. Certain ancestry feats, class features, and spells give access to special, more powerful unarmed attacks. Details for those unarmed attacks are provided in the abilities that grant them.

### Improvised Weapons
<sup>CRB p. 278</sup>

If you attack with something that wasn't built to be a weapon, such as a chair or a vase, you're making an attack with an improvised weapon. Improvised weapons are simple weapons. You take a –2 item penalty to attack rolls with an improvised weapon. The GM determines the amount and type of damage the attack deals, if any, as well as any weapon traits the improvised weapon should have.

### Weapon Statistics
<sup>CRB p. 279</sup>

The tables on pages 280 –282 list the statistics for various melee and ranged weapons that you can purchase, as well as the statistics for striking with a fist (or another basic unarmed attack). The tables present the following statistics. All weapons listed in this chapter have an item level of 0.

#### Damage
<sup>CRB p. 279</sup>

This entry lists the weapon's damage die and the type of damage it deals: B for bludgeoning, P for piercing, or S for slashing.

> [!pf2-beige] Damage Dice
> 
> Each weapon lists the damage die used for its damage roll. A standard weapon deals one die of damage, but a magical striking rune can increase the number of dice rolled, as can some special actions and spells. These additional dice use the same die size as the weapon or unarmed attack's normal damage die.
> 
> ### Counting Damage Dice
> <sup>CRB p. 279</sup>
> 
> Effects based on a weapon's number of damage dice include only the weapon's damage die plus any extra dice from a striking rune. They don't count extra dice from abilities, critical specialization effects, property runes, weapon traits, or the like.
> 
> ### Increasing Die Size
> <sup>CRB p. 279</sup>
> 
> When an effect calls on you to increase the size of your weapon damage dice, instead of using its normal weapon damage dice, use the next larger die, as listed below (so if you were using a d4, you'd use a d6, and so on). If you are already using a d12, the size is already at its maximum. You can't increase your weapon damage die size more than once.
> 
> **`1d4` ➞ `1d6` ➞ `1d8` ➞ `1d10` ➞ `1d12`**

#### Range
<sup>CRB p. 279</sup>

Ranged and thrown weapons have a range increment. Attacks with these weapons work normally up to that distance. Attack rolls beyond a weapon's range increment take a –2 penalty for each additional multiple of that increment between you and the target. Attacks beyond the sixth range increment are impossible.

For example, a shortbow takes no penalty against a target up to 60 feet away, a –2 penalty against a target beyond 60 feet but up to 120 feet away, and a –4 penalty against a target beyond 120 feet but up to 180 feet away, and so on, up to 360 feet.

#### Reload
<sup>CRB p. 279</sup>

While all weapons need some amount of time to get into position, many ranged weapons also need to be loaded and reloaded. This entry indicates how many [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions it takes to reload such weapons. This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and firing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, the GM determines whether they must be performed together as an activity, or you can spend some of those actions during one turn and the rest during your next turn.

An item with an entry of "—" must be drawn to be thrown, which usually takes an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action just like drawing any other weapon. Reloading a ranged weapon and drawing a thrown weapon both require a free hand. Switching your grip to free a hand and then to place your hands in the grip necessary to wield the weapon are both included in the actions you spend to reload a weapon.

#### Bulk
<sup>CRB p. 279</sup>

This entry gives the weapon's Bulk. A weapon's Bulk is increased or decreased if it's sized for creatures that aren't Small or Medium size, following the rules on page 295.

> [!pf2-brown] SELECTING WEAPONS
> 
> Characters who focus on combat need to carefully consider their choice of weapons, evaluating whether they want to fight in melee or at range, the weapons' damage potential, and the special features of various weapons. Characters who are primarily spellcasters usually just need to pick a backup weapon in the best category they're trained or better in.
> 
> When selecting weapons, start by identifying the weapon types you're trained or better in. You should then compare weapons within these types to determine which ones you will have the highest melee or ranged attack modifier with. It's usually considered best practice to select both a melee and ranged weapon during character creation so you can contend with a broader variety of foes and situations.
> 
> ### Weapon Categories
> <sup>CRB p. 279</sup>
> 
> Weapons fall into broad categories depending on how much damage they deal and what traits they have. Martial weapons generally deal more damage than simple weapons, and advanced weapons generally have more advantageous traits than martial weapons with the same damage. Generally, you'll want to select weapons that deal more damage, but if you're a highly skilled combatant, you might want to pick a weapon with interesting traits, even if it has a lower weapon damage die. You can also purchase multiple weapons within your budget, allowing you to switch between them for different situations.

#### Hands
<sup>CRB p. 279</sup>

Some weapons require one hand to wield, and others require two. A few items, such as a longbow, list 1+ for its Hands entry. You can hold a weapon with a 1+ entry in one hand, but the process of shooting it requires using a second to retrieve, nock, and loose an arrow. This means you can do things with your free hand while holding the bow without changing your grip, but the other hand must be free when you shoot. To properly wield a 1+ weapon, you must hold it in one hand and also have a hand free.

Weapons requiring two hands typically deal more damage. Some one-handed weapons have the two-hand trait, causing them to deal a different size of weapon damage die when used in two hands. In addition, some abilities require you to wield a weapon in two hands. You meet this requirement while holding the weapon in two hands, even if it doesn't require two hands or have the two-hand trait.

#### Group
<sup>CRB p. 280</sup>

A weapon or unarmed attack's group classifies it with similar weapons. Groups affect some abilities and what the weapon does on a critical hit if you have access to that weapon or unarmed attack's critical specialization effects; for full details, see page 283.

#### Weapon Traits
<sup>CRB p. 280</sup>

The traits a weapon or unarmed attack has are listed in this entry. Any trait that refers to a "weapon" can also apply to an unarmed attack that has that trait.

#### Ammunition
<sup>CRB p. 280</sup>

Some entries in the ranged weapons tables are followed by an entry indicating the type of ammunition that weapon launches. The damage die is determined by the weapon, not the ammunition. Because that and other relevant statistics vary by weapon, ammunition entries list only the name, quantity, Price, and Bulk. Using ammunition destroys it.

![Unarmed Attacks](rules/tables/unarmed-attacks.md)

![Melee Weapons](rules/tables/melee-weapons.md)

![Ranged Weapons](rules/tables/ranged-weapons.md)

#### Weapon Traits
<sup>CRB p. 282</sup>

Weapons and unarmed attacks with the weapon trait can have the following traits.

### Critical Specialization Effects
<sup>CRB p. 283</sup>

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.

**Axe:** Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including extra dice for its potency rune, if any). This amount isn't doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.

**Bomb:** Increase the radius of the bomb's [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage (if any) to 10 feet.

**Bow:** If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile. The target is immobilized and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds. The creature doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes), or could otherwise escape without effort.

**Brawling:** The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be slowed 1 until the end of your next turn.

**Club:** You knock the target away from you up to 10 feet (you choose the distance). This is forced movement.

**Dart:** The target takes `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls.

**Flail:** The target is knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).

**Hammer:** The target is knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).

**Knife:** The target takes `1d6` [persistent bleed](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) damage. You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls.

**Pick:** The weapon viciously pierces the target, who takes 2 additional damage per weapon damage die.

**Polearm:** The target is moved 5 feet in a direction of your choice. This is forced movement.

**Shield:** You knock the target back from you 5 feet. This is forced movement.

**Sling:** The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be stunned 1.

**Spear:** The weapon pierces the target, weakening its attacks. The target is clumsy 1 until the start of your next turn.

**Sword:** The target is made off-balance by your attack, becoming [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of your next turn.

## Gear
<sup>CRB p. 287</sup>

### Gear Statistics
<sup>CRB p. 287</sup>

[Tables 6–9](rules/tables/adventuring-gear.md) and [6–10](rules/tables/uncommon-adventuring-gear.md) list Price and Bulk entries for a wide variety of gear. Any item with a number after it in parentheses indicates that the item's Price is for the indicated quantity, though the Bulk entry for such an item is the value for only one such item. All items in this chapter are level 0 unless the item name is followed by a higher item level in parentheses.

#### Hands
<sup>CRB p. 287</sup>

This lists how many hands it takes to use the item effectively. Most items that require two hands can be carried in only one hand, but you must spend an Interact action to change your grip in order to use the item. The GM may determine that an item is too big to carry in one hand (or even two hands, for particularly large items).

#### Wearing Tools
<sup>CRB p. 287</sup>

You can make a set of tools (such as [alchemist's tools](compendium/equipment/items/alchemists-tools.md) or [healer's tools](compendium/equipment/items/healers-tools.md)) easier to use by wearing it. This allows you to draw and replace the tools as part of the action that uses them. You can wear up to 2 Bulk of tools in this manner; tools beyond this limit must be stowed or drawn with an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to use.

![Adventuring Gear](rules/tables/adventuring-gear.md)

![Uncommon Adventuring Gear](rules/tables/uncommon-adventuring-gear.md)

### Adventuring Gear
<sup>CRB p. 290</sup>

These items follow special rules or require more detail.

**Adventurer's Pack:** This item is the starter kit for an adventurer, containing the essential items for exploration and survival. The Bulk value is for the entire pack together, but see the descriptions of individual items as necessary.

The pack contains the following items: backpack (containing the other goods), bedroll, two belt pouches, 10 pieces of chalk, flint and steel, 50 feet of rope, 2 weeks' rations, soap, 5 [torches](compendium/equipment/items/torch.md), and a waterskin.

**Alchemist's Tools:** These beakers and chemicals can be used to set up a mobile alchemical laboratory. Expanded alchemist's tools give a +1 item bonus to [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) checks to create alchemical items. When you carry the tools from place to place, you keep many of the components handy on your person, in pockets or bandoliers.

**Artisan's Tools:** You need these tools to create items from raw materials with the Craft skill. Sterling artisan's tools give you a +1 item bonus to the check. Different sets are needed for different work, as determined by the GM; for example, blacksmith's tools differ from woodworker's tools.

**Backpack:** A backpack holds up to 4 Bulk of items. If you're carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its bulk is light instead of negligible.

**Basic Crafter's Book:** This book contains the 0 for [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) the common items in this chapter.

**Caltrops:** These four-pronged metal spikes can cause damage to a creature's feet. You can scatter caltrops in an empty square adjacent to you with an Interact action. The first creature that moves into that square must succeed at a DC 14 [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check or take 1d4 piercing damage and 1 [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). A creature taking [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from caltrops takes a –5-foot penalty to its Speed. Spending an Interact action to pluck the caltrops free reduces the DC to stop the bleeding. Once a creature takes damage from caltrops, enough caltrops are ruined that other creatures moving into the square are safe.

Deployed caltrops can be salvaged and reused if no creatures took damage from them. Otherwise, enough caltrops are ruined that they can't be salvaged.

**Candle:** A lit candle sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

**Chest:** A wooden chest can hold up to 8 Bulk of items.

**Climbing Kit:** This satchel includes 50 feet of rope, pulleys, a dozen pitons, a hammer, a grappling hook, and one set of crampons. Climbing kits allow you to attach yourself to the wall you're Climbing, moving half as quickly as usual (minimum 5 feet) but letting you attempt a DC 5 flat check whenever you critically fail to prevent a fall. You gain a +1 item bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to Climb while using an extreme climbing kit. A single kit has only enough materials for one climber; each climber needs their own kit.

**Clothing:** Ordinary clothing is functional with basic tailoring, such as peasant garb, monk's robes, or work clothes.

Explorer's clothing is sturdy enough that it can be reinforced to protect you, even though it isn't a suit of armor. It comes in many forms, though the most common sorts look like clerical vestments, monk's garments, or wizard's robes, as members of all three classes are likely to avoid wearing armor. For more information on explorer's clothing, see pages 275 –276.

Fine clothing, suitable for a noble or royal, is made with expensive fabrics, precious metals, and intricate patterns.

You gain a +1 item bonus to checks to Make an Impression on nobility or other upper-class folk while wearing highfashion fine clothing.

Winter clothing allows you to negate the damage from severe environmental cold and reduce the damage from extreme cold to that of severe cold.

**Compass:** A compass helps you Sense Direction or navigate, provided you're in a location with uniform magnetic fields. Without a compass, you take a –2 item penalty to these checks (similar to using a shoddy item).

A lensatic compass gives you a +1 item bonus to these checks.

**Crowbar:** When Forcing Open an object that doesn't have an easy grip, a crowbar makes it easier to gain the necessary leverage. Without a crowbar, prying something open takes a –2 item penalty to the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to Force Open (similar to using a shoddy item). A levered crowbar grants you a +1 item bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to Force Open anything that can be pried open.

**Disguise Kit:** This small wooden box contains cosmetics, false facial hair, spirit gum, and a few simple wigs. You usually need a disguise kit to set up a disguise in order to Impersonate someone using the [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) skill.

An elite disguise kit adds a +1 item bonus to relevant checks. If you've crafted a large number of disguises, you can replenish your cosmetics supply with replacement cosmetics suitable for the type of your disguise kit.

**Fishing Tackle:** This kit include a collapsible fishing pole, fishhooks, line, lures, and a fishing net. Professional fishing tackle grants a +1 item bonus to checks to fish.

**Flint and Steel:** Flint and steel are useful in creating a fire if you have the time to catch a spark, though using them is typically too time-consuming to be practical during an encounter. Even in ideal conditions, using flint and steel to light a flame requires using at least 3 actions, and often significantly longer.

**Formula Book:** A formula book holds the formulas necessary to make items other than the common equipment from this chapter; alchemists typically get one for free. Each formula book can hold the formulas for up to 100 different items. Formulas can also appear on parchment sheets, tablets, and almost any other medium; there's no need for you to copy them into a specific book as long as you can keep them on hand to reference them.

**Grappling Hook:** You can throw a grappling hook with a rope tied to it to make a climb easier. To anchor a grappling hook, make an attack roll with the secret trait against a DC depending on the target, typically at least DC 20. On a success, your hook has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold but actually falls when you're partway up.

**Healer's Tools:** This kit of bandages, herbs, and suturing tools is necessary for [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) checks to Administer First Aid, Treat Disease, Treat Poison, or Treat Wounds.

Expanded healer's tools provide a +1 item bonus to such checks. When you carry the tools from place to place, you keep many of the components handy on your person, in pockets or bandoliers.

**Holly and Mistletoe:** Plants of supernatural significance provide a primal focus for primal spellcasters, such as druids, when using certain abilities and casting some spells.

A bundle of holly and mistletoe must be held in one hand to use it. Other primal foci exist for druids focused on other aspects of nature.

**Lantern:** A lantern sheds bright light and requires 1 pint of oil to function for 6 hours.

A bull's-eye lantern emits its light in a 60-foot cone (and dim light in the next 60 feet).

A hooded lantern sheds light in a 30-foot radius (and dim light in the next 30 feet) and is equipped with shutters, which you can close to block the light.

Closing or opening the shutters takes an Interact action.

**Lock:** Picking a poor lock requires two successful DC 15 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) checks, a simple lock requires three successful DC 20 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) checks, an average lock requires four successes at DC 25, a good lock requires five successes at DC 30, and a superior lock six successes at DC 40.

**Magnifying Glass:** This quality handheld lens gives you a +1 item bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to notice minute details of documents, fabric, and the like.

**Manacles:** You can manacle someone who is willing or otherwise at your mercy as an exploration activity taking 10–30 seconds depending on the creature's size and how many manacles you apply. A two-legged creature with its legs bound takes a –15-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds, and a two-handed creature with its wrists bound has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check any time it uses a manipulate action or else that action fails. This DC may be higher depending on how tightly the manacles constrain the hands. A creature bound to a stationary object is immobilized. For creatures with more or fewer limbs, the GM determines what effect manacles have, if any. Freeing a creature from poor manacles requires two successful DC 17 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) checks, simple manacles requires three successes at DC 22, average manacles require four successes at DC 27, good manacles require five successes at DC 32, and superior manacles require six successes at DC 42.

**Material Component Pouch:** This pouch contains material components for those spells that require them.

Though the components are used up over time, you can refill spent components during your daily preparations.

**Musical Instrument:** Handheld instruments include bagpipes, a small set of chimes, small drums, fiddles and viols, flutes and recorders, small harps, lutes, trumpets, and similarly sized instruments. The GM might rule that an especially large handheld instrument (like a tuba) has greater Bulk. Heavy instruments such as large drums, a full set of chimes, and keyboard instruments are less portable and generally need to be stationary while played.

A virtuoso instrument gives a +1 item bonus to [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks using that instrument.

**Oil:** You can use oil to fuel lanterns, but you can also set a pint of oil aflame and throw it. You must first spend an Interact action preparing the oil, then throw it with another action as a ranged attack. If you hit, it splatters on the creature or in a single 5-foot square you target. You must succeed at a DC 10 flat check for the oil to ignite successfully when it hits.

If the oil ignites, the target takes `1d6` fire damage.

**Piton:** These small spikes can be used as anchors to make climbing easier. To affix a piton, you must hold it in one hand and use a hammer to drive it in with your other hand. You can attach a rope to the hammered piton so that you don't fall all the way to the ground on a critical failure while Climbing.

**Religious Symbol:** This piece of wood or silver is emblazoned with an image representing a deity. Some divine spellcasters, such as clerics, can use a religious symbol of their deity as a divine focus to use certain abilities and cast some spells. A religious symbol must be held in one hand to use it.

**Religious Text:** This manuscript contains scripture of a particular religion. Some divine spellcasters, such as clerics, can use a religious text as a divine focus to use certain abilities and cast some spells. A religious text must be held in one hand to use it.

**Repair Kit:** A repair kit allows you to perform simple repairs while traveling.

It contains a portable anvil, tongs, woodworking tools, a whetstone, and oils for conditioning leather and wood. You can use a repair kit to Repair items using the [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) skill. A superb repair kit gives you a +1 item bonus to the check.

**Sack:** A sack can hold up to 8 Bulk worth of items. A sack containing 2 Bulk or less can be worn on the body, usually tucked into a belt. You can carry a sack with one hand, but must use two hands to transfer items in and out.

**Saddlebags:** Saddlebags come in a pair. Each can hold up to 3 Bulk of items. The Bulk value given is for saddlebags worn by a mount. If you are carrying or stowing saddlebags, they count as 1 Bulk instead of light Bulk.

**Scholarly Journal:** Scholarly journals are uncommon.

Each scholarly journal is a folio on a very specific topic, such as vampires or the history of a single town or neighborhood of a city. If you spend 1 minute referencing an academic journal before attempting a skill check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about the subject, you gain a +1 item bonus to the check. A compendium of journals costs five times as much as a single journal and requires both hands to use; each compendium contains several journals and grants its bonus on a broader topic, such as all undead or a whole city. The GM determines what scholarly journals are available in any location.

**Signal Whistle:** When sounded, a signal whistle can be heard clearly up to half a mile away across open terrain.

**Snare Kit:** This kit contains tools and materials for creating snares. A snare kit allows you to Craft snares using the [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) skill. A specialist snare kit gives you a +1 item bonus to the check.

**Spellbook:** A spellbook holds the written knowledge necessary to learn and prepare various spells, a necessity for wizards (who typically get one for free) and a useful luxury for other spellcasters looking to learn additional spells. Each spellbook can hold up to 100 spells. The Price listed is for a blank spellbook.

**Spyglass:** A typical spyglass lets you see eight times farther than normal. A fine spyglass adds a +1 item bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks to notice details at a distance.

**Survey Map:** Maps are [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait").

Most maps you can find are simple and functional. A survey map details a single location in excellent detail. One of these maps gives you a +1 item bonus to [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) checks and any skill checks to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), provided the checks are related to the location detailed on the map.

Maps sometimes come in atlases, containing a number of maps of the same quality, often on similar topics. An atlas costs five times as much as a single map and requires both hands to use. The GM determines what maps are available in any location.

**Tack:** Tack includes all the gear required to outfit a riding animal, including a saddle, bit and bridle, and stirrups if necessary. Especially large or oddly shaped animals might require specialty saddles. These can be more expensive or hard to find, as determined by the GM. The Bulk value given is for tack worn by a creature.

If carried, the Bulk increases to 2.

**Ten-Foot Pole:** When wielding this long pole, you can use Seek to search a square up to 10 feet away. The pole is not sturdy enough to use as a weapon.

**Thieves' Tools:** You need thieves' tools to Pick Locks or Disable Devices (of some types) using the [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) skill.

Infiltrator thieves' tools add a +1 item bonus to checks to Pick Locks and Disable Devices. If your thieves' tools are broken, you can repair them by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks appropriate to your tools; this doesn't require using the Repair action.

**Tool:** This entry is a catchall for basic hand tools that don't have a specific adventuring purpose. A hoe, shovel, or sledgehammer is a long tool, and a hand drill, ice hook, or trowel is a short tool. A tool can usually be used as an improvised weapon, dealing 1d4 damage for a short tool or 1d6 for a long tool. The GM determines the damage type that's appropriate or adjusts the damage if needed.

**Torch:** A torch sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet). It can be used as an improvised weapon that deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage plus 1 fire damage.

**Waterskin:** When it's full, a waterskin has 1 Bulk and contains roughly 1 day's worth of water for a Small or Medium creature.

**Writing Set:** Using a writing set, you can draft correspondence and scribe scrolls. A set includes stationery, including a variety of paper and parchment, as well as ink, a quill or inkpen, sealing wax, and a simple seal. If you've written a large amount, you can refill your kit with extra ink and paper.

### Class Kits

If you want to quickly decide how to spend your starting money on what your class needs, start with one of these kits. Note than an adventurer's pack, which is included in each kit, contains a backpack, a bedroll, two belt pouches, 10 pieces of chalk, flint and steel, 50 feet of rope, 2 weeks' rations, soap, 5 [torches](compendium/equipment/items/torch.md), and a waterskin.

### Alchemical Gear
<sup>CRB p. 292</sup>

The items listed on Table 6–11 are the most widely available alchemical items from Chapter 11, which a 1st-level character could likely access. The descriptions below are incomplete; each item's full entry appears in Chapter 11 on the page listed in the table. Your GM might allow you to start with other alchemical items from Chapter 11 on a case-by-case basis.

![Alchemical Gear](rules/tables/alchemical-gear.md)

#### Alchemical Bombs
<sup>CRB p. 292</sup>

Alchemical bombs are consumable weapons that deal damage or produce special effects, and they sometimes deal [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage. For more on alchemical bombs, see page 544.

**Lesser Acid Flask:** This alchemical bomb deals 1 acid damage, `1d6` [persistent acid damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and 1 acid [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage.

**Lesser Alchemist's Fire:** This alchemical bomb deals 1d8 fire damage, 1 [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and 1 fire [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage.

**Lesser Bottled Lightning:** This alchemical bomb deals `1d6` electricity damage and 1 electricity [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage, and it makes the target [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed).

**Lesser Frost Vial:** This alchemical bomb deals `1d6` cold damage and 1 cold [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage, and it gives the target a –5-foot status penalty to its Speeds until the end of its next turn.

**Lesser Tanglefoot Bag:** This alchemical bomb gives the target a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute, and the target is immobilized on a critical hit unless it [Escapes](rules/actions/escape.md).

**Lesser Thunderstone:** This alchemical bomb deals `1d4` sonic damage and 1 sonic [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage, and any creature within 10 feet that fails a DC 17 Fortitude save is deafened until the end of its turn.

#### Elixirs
<sup>CRB p. 292</sup>

Elixirs are alchemical items you drink to gain various unusual effects. For more on elixirs, see page 546.

**Lesser Antidote:** After drinking a lesser antidote, you gain a +2 item bonus to Fortitude saves against poison for 6 hours.

**Lesser Antiplague:** After drinking a lesser antiplague, you gain a +2 item bonus to Fortitude saves against disease for 24 hours, including your saves against diseases' progression.

**Lesser Elixir of Life:** Drinking a lesser elixir of life restores 1d6 Hit Points and grants a +1 item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 10 minutes.

#### Alchemical Tools
<sup>CRB p. 292</sup>

Alchemical tools are a type of alchemical item you use, rather than drink or throw. For more on alchemical tools, see page 564.

**Smokestick:** You create a 5-foot radius smokescreen for 1 minute.

**Sunrod:** You can strike a sunrod on a hard surface as an Interact action to cause it to shed bright light in a 20-foot radius (dim light in the next 20 feet) for 6 hours.

**Tindertwig:** You can use a tindertwig to ignite something flammable with a single Interact action, faster than with flint and steel.

### Magical Gear
<sup>CRB p. 293</sup>

The items on Table 6–12 are the magic items from Chapter 11 that a 1st-level character could most frequently access. The descriptions below are incomplete; the items' full entries appear in Chapter 11 on the pages listed in the table. Your GM might allow you to start with other magic items from Chapter 11 on a case-by-case basis.

![Magical Gear](rules/tables/magical-gear.md)

#### Consumable Magic Items
<sup>CRB p. 293</sup>

You can typically purchase [holy](compendium/equipment/items/holy-water.md) and [unholy water](compendium/equipment/items/unholy-water.md) in a settlement. Particularly good settlements tend to ban [unholy water](compendium/equipment/items/unholy-water.md) and evil settlements tend to ban [holy water](compendium/equipment/items/holy-water.md).

**Holy Water:** You can throw [holy water](compendium/equipment/items/holy-water.md) like a bomb, dealing `1d6` good damage and 1 good [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage to fiends, undead, and other creatures weak to good damage.

**Unholy Water:** You can throw [unholy water](compendium/equipment/items/unholy-water.md) like a bomb, dealing `1d6` evil damage and 1 evil [splash](rules/traits/splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait") damage to celestials and other creatures weak to evil damage.

#### Potions
<sup>CRB p. 293</sup>

Potions are magic items you drink to gain a variety of benefits. For more on potions, see page 562.

#### Scrolls
<sup>CRB p. 293</sup>

Scrolls are magical scriptures that hold the necessary magic to cast a particular spell without using your spell slots.

The Price listed in the table is for a scroll with a common 1st-level spell. For more on scrolls, see page 564.

#### Talismans
<sup>CRB p. 293</sup>

A talisman is a special, single-use item you affix to your armor, a weapon, or elsewhere, allowing you to activate the talisman later for a special benefit. For more on talismans, see page 565.

**Potency Crystal:** When you affix the crystal to a weapon and activate it, this talisman empowers the weapon for the rest of the turn, granting it a +1 item bonus to attack rolls and a second weapon damage die.

### Formulas
<sup>CRB p. 293</sup>

Formulas are instructions for making items with the [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) activity. You can usually read a formula as long as you can read the language it's written in, though you might lack the skill to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) the item. Often, alchemists and crafting guilds use obscure languages or create codes to protect their formulas from rivals.

You can buy common formulas at the Price listed on [Table 6–13](rules/tables/formulas.md), or you can hire an NPC to let you copy their formula for the same Price. A purchased formula is typically a schematic on rolled-up parchment of light Bulk. You can copy a formula into your formula book in 1 hour, either from a schematic or directly from someone else's formula book. If you have a formula, you can [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) a copy of it using the [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) skill. Formulas for uncommon items and rare items are usually significantly more valuable—if you can find them at all!

If you have an item, you can try to reverse-engineer its formula. This uses the Craft activity and takes the same amount of time as creating the item from a formula would. You must first disassemble the item. After the base downtime, you attempt a [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check against the same DC it would take to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) the item. If you succeed, you [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) the formula at its full Price, and you can keep working to reduce the Price as normal. If you fail, you're left with raw materials and no formula. If you critically fail, you also waste 10% of the raw materials you'd normally be able to salvage.

The item's disassembled parts are worth half its Price in raw materials and can't be reassembled unless you successfully reverse-engineer the formula or acquire the formula another way. Reassembling the item from the formula works just like [Crafting](rules/actions/craft.md) it from scratch; you use the disassembled parts as the necessary raw materials.

![Formulas](rules/tables/formulas.md)

#### Items with Multiple Types
<sup>CRB p. 293</sup>

If an item has multiple types of different levels, each type has its own formula, and you need the formula for the specific type of item you want to Craft. For example, _if you have a formula for a type I bag of holding but not for a type II bag of holding, you must acquire a separate formula to Craft a type II bag of holding._

### Services
<sup>CRB p. 294</sup>

The services listed on [Table 6–14](rules/tables/basic-services-and-consumables.md) describe expenditures for common services and consumables.

![Basic Services and Consumables](rules/tables/basic-services-and-consumables.md)

#### Hirelings
<sup>CRB p. 294</sup>

Paid laborers can provide services for you. Unskilled hirelings can perform simple manual labor and are untrained at most skills. Skilled hirelings have expert proficiency in a particular skill. Hirelings are level 0. If a skill check is needed, an untrained hireling has a +0 modifier, while a skilled hireling has a +4 modifier in their area of expertise and +0 for other skill checks. Hirelings' rates double if they're going adventuring with you.

#### Transportation
<sup>CRB p. 294</sup>

The cost to hire transportation includes standard travel with no amenities. Most transit services provide basic sleeping arrangements, and some provide meals at the rates listed on Table 6–14. Arranging transportation into dangerous lands can be more expensive or impossible.

#### Spellcasting
<sup>CRB p. 294</sup>

Spellcasting services, listed on [Table 6–15](rules/tables/spellcasting-services.md), are uncommon. Having a spell cast for you requires finding a spellcaster who knows and is willing to cast it. It's hard to find someone who can cast higher-level spells, and uncommon spells typically cost at least 100% more, if you can find someone who knows them at all. Spells that take a long time to cast (over 1 minute) usually cost 25% more. You must pay any cost listed in the spell in addition to the Price on the table.

![Spellcasting Services](rules/tables/spellcasting-services.md)

### Cost of Living
<sup>CRB p. 294</sup>

[Table 6–16](rules/tables/cost-of-living.md) shows how much it costs to get by. This covers room and board, dues, taxes, and other fees.

![Cost of Living](rules/tables/cost-of-living.md)

### Animals
<sup>CRB p. 294</sup>

The Prices for animals are listed both for renting and for purchasing them outright. You usually need to pay for animal rentals up front, and if the vendor believes the animal might be put in danger, they typically require a deposit equal to the purchase Price. Most animals panic in battle. When combat begins, they become [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) and [fleeing](rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) as long as they're [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened). If you successfully Command your Animal using [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature), you can keep it from fleeing, though this doesn't remove its frightened condition. If the animal is attacked or damaged, it returns to [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) and [fleeing](rules/conditions.md#Fleeing), with the same exceptions.

Warhorses and warponies are combat trained. They don't become [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) or [fleeing](rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) during encounters in this way.

![Animals](rules/tables/animals.md)

#### Barding
<sup>CRB p. 295</sup>

You can purchase special armor for animals, called barding (shown on [Table 6–18](rules/tables/barding.md)). All animals have a trained proficiency rank in light barding, and combat-trained animals are trained in heavy barding. Barding uses the same rules as armor except for the following. The Price and Bulk of barding depend on the animal's size. Unlike for a suit of armor, barding's Strength entry is listed as a modifier, not a score. Barding can't be etched with magic runes, though special magical barding might be available.

![Barding](rules/tables/barding.md)

### Items and Sizes
<sup>CRB p. 295</sup>

The Bulk rules in this chapter are for [Small](rules/traits/small-b1.md "Small Size Trait") and [Medium](rules/traits/medium-b1.md "Medium Size Trait") creatures, as the items are made for creatures of those sizes. Large creatures can carry more, and smaller creatures can carry less, as noted on [Table 6–19](rules/tables/bulk-conversions.md).

These rules for Bulk limits come up most often when a group tries to load up a mount or animal companion. The rules for items of different sizes tend to come into play when the characters defeat a big creature that has gear, since in most cases, the only creatures of other sizes are creatures under the GM's control. In most cases, Small or Medium creatures can wield a Large weapon, though it's unwieldy, giving them the clumsy 1 condition, and the larger size is canceled by the difficulty of swinging the weapon, so it grants no special benefit. Large armor is simply too large for Small and Medium creatures.

#### Bulk Conversions for Different Sizes
<sup>CRB p. 295</sup>

As shown in [Table 6–19](rules/tables/bulk-conversions.md), [Large](rules/traits/large-b1.md "Large Size Trait") or larger creatures are less encumbered by bulky items than [Small](rules/traits/small-b1.md "Small Size Trait") or [Medium](rules/traits/medium-b1.md "Medium Size Trait") creatures, while [Tiny](rules/traits/tiny-b1.md "Tiny Size Trait") creatures become overburdened more quickly. A [Large](rules/traits/large-b1.md "Large Size Trait") creature treats 10 items of 1 Bulk as 1 Bulk, a [Huge](rules/traits/huge-b1.md "Huge Size Trait") creature treats 10 items of 2 Bulk as 1 Bulk, and so on. A [Tiny](rules/traits/tiny-b1.md "Tiny Size Trait") creature treats 10 items of negligible Bulk as 1 Bulk. Negligible items work in a similar way—a [Huge](rules/traits/huge-b1.md "Huge Size Trait") creature treats items of 1 Bulk as negligible, so it can carry any number of items of 1 Bulk. A [Tiny](rules/traits/tiny-b1.md "Tiny Size Trait") creature doesn't treat any items as having negligible Bulk.

![Bulk conversions](rules/tables/bulk-conversions.md)

#### Items of Different Sizes
<sup>CRB p. 295</sup>

Creatures of sizes other than [Small](rules/traits/small-b1.md "Small Size Trait") or [Medium](rules/traits/medium-b1.md "Medium Size Trait") need items appropriate to their size. These items have different Bulk and possibly a different Price. [Table 6 –20](rules/tables/differently-sized-items.md) provides the Price and Bulk conversion for such items.

![Differently Sized Items](rules/tables/differently-sized-items.md)

For example, a [morningstar](compendium/equipment/items/morningstar.md) sized for a [Medium](rules/traits/medium-b1.md "Medium Size Trait") creature has a Price of 1 gp and 1 Bulk, so one made for a [Huge](rules/traits/huge-b1.md "Huge Size Trait") creature has a Price of 4 gp and 4 Bulk. One made for a [Tiny](rules/traits/tiny-b1.md "Tiny Size Trait") creature still costs 1 gp (due to its intricacy) and has 1/2 Bulk, which rounds down to light Bulk.

Because the way that a creature treats Bulk and the Bulk of gear sized for it scale the same way, [Tiny](rules/traits/tiny-b1.md "Tiny Size Trait") or [Large](rules/traits/large-b1.md "Large Size Trait") (or larger) creatures can usually wear and carry about the same amount of appropriately sized gear as a [Medium](rules/traits/medium-b1.md "Medium Size Trait") creature.

Higher-level magic items that cost significantly more than 8 times the cost of a mundane item can use their listed Price regardless of size. Precious materials, however, have a Price based on the Bulk of the item, so multiply the Bulk value as described on [Table 6 –20](rules/tables/differently-sized-items.md), then use the formula in the precious material's entry to determine the item's Price. See page 578 for more information.
