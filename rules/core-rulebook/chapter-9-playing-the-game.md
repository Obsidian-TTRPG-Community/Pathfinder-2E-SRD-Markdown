# Chapter 9: Playing the Game
<sup>CRB p. 443</sup>

Before diving into how to play Pathfinder, it's important to understand the game's three modes of play, which determine the pace of your adventure and the specific rules you'll use at a given time. Each mode provides a different pace and presents a different level of risk to your characters. The Game Master (GM) determines which mode works best for the story and controls the transition between them.

You'll likely talk about the modes less formally during your play session, simply transitioning between exploration and encounters during the adventure, before heading to a settlement to achieve something during downtime.

The most intricate of the modes is **encounter mode**. This is where most of the intense action takes place, and it's most often used for combat or other high-stakes situations. The GM typically switches to encounter mode by calling on the players to "roll for initiative" to determine the order in which all the actors take their turns during the encounter.

Time is then divided into a series of rounds, each lasting roughly 6 seconds in the game world. Each round, player characters, other creatures, and sometimes even hazards or events take their turn in initiative order. At the start of a participant's turn, they gain the use of a number of actions (typically 3 in the case of PCs and other creatures) as well as a special action called a reaction. These actions, and what you do with them, are how you affect the world within an encounter. The full rules for playing in encounter mode start on page 468.

In **exploration mode**, time is more flexible and the play more free form. In this mode, minutes, hours, or even days in the game world pass quickly in the real world, as the characters travel cross country, explore uninhabited sections of a dungeon, or roleplay during a social gathering. Often, developments during exploration lead to encounters, and the GM will switch to that mode of play until the encounter ends, before returning to exploration mode. The rules for exploration start on page 479.

The third mode is **downtime**. During downtime, the characters are at little risk, and the passage of time is measured in days or longer. This is when you might forge a magic sword, research a new spell, or prepare for your next adventure. The rules for downtime are on page 481.

## General Rules
<sup>CRB p. 443</sup>

Before exploring the specific rules of each mode of play, you'll want to understand a number of general rules of the game. To one degree or another, these rules are used in every mode of play.

## Making Choices
<sup>CRB p. 443</sup>

Pathfinder is a game where your choices determine the story's direction. Throughout the game, the GM describes what's happening in the world and then asks the players, "So what do you do?" Exactly what you choose to do, and how the GM responds to those choices, builds a unique story experience. Every game is different, because you'll rarely, if ever, make the same decisions as another group of players.

This is true for the GM as well—two GMs running the exact same adventure will put different emphasis and flourishes on the way they present each scenario and encounter.

Often, your choices have no immediate risk or consequences. If you're traveling along a forest path and come across a fork in the trail, the GM will ask, "Which way do you go?" You might choose to take the right fork or the left. You could also choose to leave the trail, or just go back to town. Once your choice is made, the GM tells you what happens next. Down the line, that choice may impact what you encounter later in the game, but in many cases nothing dangerous happens immediately.

But sometimes what happens as a result of your choices is less than certain. In those cases, you'll attempt a check.

## Checks
<sup>CRB p. 443</sup>

When success isn't certain—whether you're swinging a sword at a foul beast, attempting to leap across a chasm, or straining to remember the name of the earl's second cousin at a soiree—you'll attempt a check. Pathfinder has many types of checks, from skill checks to attack rolls to saving throws, but they all follow these basic steps.

- Roll a d20 and identify the modifiers, bonuses, and penalties that apply.
- Calculate the result.
- Compare the result to the difficulty class (DC).
- Determine the degree of success and the effect.

Checks and difficulty classes (DC) both come in many forms. When you swing your sword at that foul beast, you'll make an attack roll against its Armor Class, which is the DC to hit another creature. If you are leaping across that chasm, you'll attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill check with a DC based on the distance you are trying to jump. When calling to mind the name of the earl's second cousin, you attempt a check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md). You might use either the Society skill or a Lore skill you have that's relevant to the task, and the DC depends on how common the knowledge of the cousin's name might be, or how many drinks your character had when they were introduced to the cousin the night before.

No matter the details, for any check you must roll the d20 and achieve a result equal to or greater than the DC to succeed. Each of these steps is explained below.

> [!pf2-brown] Game Conventions
> 
> Pathfinder has many specific rules, but you'll also want to keep these general guidelines in mind when playing.
> 
> ### The GM Has the Final Say
> <sup>CRB p. 444</sup>
> 
> If you're ever uncertain how to apply a rule, the GM decides.
> 
> Of course, Pathfinder is a game, so when adjudicating the rules, the GM is encouraged to listen to everyone's point of view and make a decision that is both fair and fun.
> 
> ### Specific Overrides General
> <sup>CRB p. 444</sup>
> 
> A core principle of Pathfinder is that specific rules override general ones. If two rules conflict, the more specific one takes precedence. If there's still ambiguity, the GM determines which rule to use. For example, the rules state that when attacking a concealed creature, you must attempt a DC 5 flat check to determine if you hit. Flat checks don't benefit from modifiers, bonuses, or penalties, but an ability that's specifically designed to overcome concealment might override and alter this. If a rule doesn't specify otherwise, default to the general rules presented in this chapter. While some special rules may also state the normal rules to provide context, you should always default to the normal rules even if effects don't specifically say to.
> 
> ### Rounding
> <sup>CRB p. 444</sup>
> 
> You may need to calculate a fraction of a value, like halving damage. Always round down unless otherwise specified.
> 
> For example, if a spell deals 7 damage and a creature takes half damage from it, that creature takes 3 damage.
> 
> ### Multiplying
> <sup>CRB p. 444</sup>
> 
> When more than one effect would multiply the same number, don't multiply more than once. Instead, combine all the multipliers into a single multiplier, with each multiple after the first adding 1 less than its value. For instance, if one ability doubled the duration of one of your spells and another one doubled the duration of the same spell, you would triple the duration, not quadruple it.
> 
> ### Duplicate Effects
> <sup>CRB p. 444</sup>
> 
> When you're affected by the same thing multiple times, only one instance applies, using the higher level of the effects, or the newer effect if the two are the same level. For example, if you were using [mage armor](compendium/spells/mage-armor.md) and then cast it again, you'd still benefit from only one casting of that spell. Casting a spell again on the same target might get you a better duration or effect if it were cast at a higher level the second time, but otherwise doing so gives you no advantage.
> 
> ### Ambiguous Rules
> <sup>CRB p. 444</sup>
> 
> Sometimes a rule could be interpreted multiple ways. If one version is too good to be true, it probably is. If a rule seems to have wording with problematic repercussions or doesn't work as intended, work with your group to find a good solution, rather than just playing with the rule as printed.

### Step 1: Roll D20 and Identify The Modifiers, Bonuses, and Penalties That Apply
<sup>CRB p. 444</sup>

Start by rolling your d20. You'll then identify all the relevant modifiers, bonuses, and penalties that apply to the roll. A **modifier** can be either positive or negative, but a **bonus** is always positive, and a **penalty** is always negative.

The sum of all the modifiers, bonuses, and penalties you apply to the d20 roll is called your total modifier for that statistic.

Nearly all checks allow you to add an **ability modifier** to the roll. An ability modifier represents your raw capabilities and is derived from an ability score, as described on page 20. Exactly which ability modifier you use is determined by what you're trying to accomplish. Usually a sword swing applies your Strength modifier, whereas remembering the name of the earl's cousin uses your Intelligence modifier.

When attempting a check that involves something you have some training in, you will also add your **bonus**. This bonus depends on your proficiency rank:

untrained, trained, expert, master, or legendary. If you're untrained, your bonus is +0—you must rely on raw talent and any bonuses from the situation. Otherwise, the bonus equals your character's level plus a certain amount depending on your rank. If your proficiency rank is trained, this bonus is equal to your level + 2, and higher proficiency ranks further increase the amount you add to your level.

| Proficiency Rank | Proficiency Bonus |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Untrained | 0 |
| Trained | Your level + 2 |
| Expert | Your level + 4 |
| Master | Your level + 6 |
| Legendary | Your level + 8 |

There are three other types of bonus that frequently appear: circumstance bonuses, item bonuses, and status bonuses. If you have different types of bonus that would apply to the same roll, you'll add them all. But if you have multiple bonuses of the same type, you can use only the highest bonus on a given roll—in other words, they don't "stack." For instance, if you have both a proficiency bonus and an item bonus, you add both to your d20 result, but if you have two item bonuses that could apply to the same check, you add only the higher of the two.

**Circumstance bonuses** typically involve the situation you find yourself in when attempting a check. For instance, using Raise a Shield with a buckler grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. Being behind cover grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC. If you are both behind cover and Raising a Shield, you gain only the +2 circumstance bonus for cover, since they're the same type and the bonus from cover is higher.

**Item bonuses** are granted by some item that you are wearing or using, either mundane or magical. For example, armor gives you an item bonus to AC, while expanded alchemist's tools grant you an item bonus to [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) checks when making alchemical items.

**Status bonuses** typically come from spells, other magical effects, or something applying a helpful, often temporary, condition to you. For instance, the 3rd-level [heroism](compendium/spells/heroism.md) spell grants a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks, saving throws, and skill checks. If you were under the effect of [heroism](compendium/spells/heroism.md) and someone cast the [bless](compendium/spells/bless.md) spell, which also grants a +1 status bonus on attacks, your attack rolls would gain only a +1 status bonus, since both spells grant a +1 status bonus to those rolls, and you only take the highest status bonus.

Penalties work very much like bonuses. You can have {**circumstance penalties**, **status penalties**, and sometimes even **item penalties.** Like bonuses of the same type, you take only the worst all of various penalties of a given type. However, you can apply both a bonus and a penalty of the same type on a single roll. For example, if you had a +1 status bonus from a [heroism](compendium/spells/heroism.md) spell but a –2 status penalty from the sickened condition, you'd apply them both to your roll—so [heroism](compendium/spells/heroism.md) still helps even though you're feeling unwell.

Unlike bonuses, penalties can also be **untyped**, in which case they won't be classified as "circumstance," "item," or "status." Unlike other penalties, you always add all your untyped penalties together rather than simply taking the worst one. For instance, when you use attack actions, you incur a multiple attack penalty on each attack you make on your turn after the first attack, and when you attack a target that's beyond your weapon's normal range increment, you incur a range penalty on the attack.

Because these are both untyped penalties, if you make multiple attacks at a faraway target, you'd apply both the multiple attack penalty and the range penalty to your roll.

Once you've identified all your various modifiers, bonuses, and penalties, you move on to the next step.

### Step 2: Calculate the Result
<sup>CRB p. 445</sup>

This step is simple. Add up all the various modifiers, bonuses, and penalties you identified in Step 1—this is your total modifier. Next add that to the number that came up on your d20 roll. This total is your check result.

### Step 3: Compare the Result to the DC
<sup>CRB p. 445</sup>

This step can be simple, or it can create suspense. Sometimes you'll know the **Difficulty Class** (**DC**) of your check. In these cases, if your result is equal to or greater than the DC, you succeed! If your roll anything less than the DC, you fail.

Other times, you might not know the DC right away. Swimming across a river would require an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check, but it doesn't have a specified DC—so how will you know if you succeed or fail? You call out your result to the GM and they will let you know if it is a success, failure, or otherwise. While you might learn the exact DC through trial and error, DCs sometimes change, so asking the GM whether a check is successful is the best way to determine whether or not you have met or exceeded the DC.

#### Calculating DCs
<sup>CRB p. 445</sup>

Whenever you attempt a check, you compare your result against a DC. When someone or something else attempts a check against you, rather than both forces rolling against one another, the GM (or player, if the opponent is another PC) compares their result to a fixed DC based on your relevant statistic. Your DC for a given statistic is 10 + the total modifier for that statistic.

### Step 4: Determine the Degree of Success and Effect
<sup>CRB p. 445</sup>

Many times, it's important to determine not only if you succeed or fail, but also how spectacularly you succeed or fail. Exceptional results—either good or bad—can cause you to critically succeed at or critically fail a check.

You critically succeed at a check when a check's result meets or exceeds the DC by 10 or more. If the check is an attack roll, this is sometimes called a critical hit. You can also critically fail a check. The rules for critical failure—sometimes called a fumble—are the same as those for a critical success, but in the other direction: if you fail a check by 10 or more, that's a critical failure.

If you rolled a 20 on the die (a "natural 20"), your result is one degree of success better than it would be by numbers alone. If you roll a 1 on the d20 (a "natural 1"), your result is one degree worse. This means that a natural 20 usually results in a critical success and natural 1 usually results in a critical failure. However, if you were going up against a very high DC, you might get only a success with a natural 20, or even a failure if 20 plus your total modifier is 10 or more below the DC. Likewise, if your modifier for a statistic is so high that adding it to a 1 from your d20 roll exceeds the DC by 10 or more, you can succeed even if you roll a natural 1! If a feat, magic item, spell, or other effect does not list a critical success or critical failure, treat is as an ordinary success or failure instead.

Some other abilities can change the degree of success for rolls you get. When resolving the effect of an ability that changes your degree of success, always apply the adjustment from a natural 20 or natural 1 before anything else.

## Specific Checks
<sup>CRB p. 446</sup>

While most checks follow these basic rules, it's useful to know about a few specific types of checks, how they're used, and how they differ from one another.

### Attack Rolls
<sup>CRB p. 446</sup>

When you use a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) action or make a spell attack, you attempt a check called an attack roll. Attack rolls take a variety of forms and are often highly variable based on the weapon you are using for the attack, but there are three main types: melee attack rolls, ranged attack rolls, and spell attack rolls. Spell attack rolls work a little bit differently, so they are explained separately on the next page.

**Melee attack rolls** use Strength as their ability modifier by default. If you're using a weapon or attack with the [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md) trait, then you can use your Dexterity modifier instead.

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Melee attack roll result = d20 roll + Strength modifier (or optionally Dexterity modifier for a [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md) weapon) + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties

**Ranged attack rolls** use Dexterity as their ability modifier.

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Ranged attack roll result = d20 roll + Dexterity modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties

When attacking with a weapon, whether melee or ranged, you add your proficiency bonus for the weapon you're using. Your class determines your proficiency rank for various weapons. Sometimes, you'll have different proficiency ranks for different weapons. For instance, at 5th level, a fighter gains the weapon mastery class feature, which grants master proficiency with the simple and martial weapons of one weapon group, expert proficiency with advanced weapons of that group and other simple and martial weapons, and trained proficiency in all other advanced weapons.

The bonuses you might apply to attack rolls can come from a variety of sources. Circumstance bonuses can come from the aid of an ally or a beneficial situation. Status bonuses are typically granted by spells and other magical aids. The item bonus to attack rolls comes from magic weapons—notably, a weapon's potency rune (page 580).

Penalties to attack rolls come from situations and effects as well. Circumstance penalties come from risky tactics or detrimental circumstances, status penalties come from spells and magic working against you, and item penalties occur when you use a shoddy item (page 273). When making attack rolls, two main types of untyped penalties are likely to apply. The first is the multiple attack penalty, and the second is the range penalty. The first applies anytime you make more than one attack action during the course of your turn, and the other applies only with ranged or thrown weapons. Both are described below.

#### Multiple Attack Penalty
<sup>CRB p. 446</sup>

The more attacks you make beyond your first in a single turn, the less accurate you become, represented by the multiple attack penalty. The second time you use an [attack](rules/traits/attack.md) action during your turn, you take a –5 penalty to your check. The third time you attack, and on any subsequent attacks, you take a –10 penalty to your check. Every check that has the [attack](rules/traits/attack.md) trait counts toward your multiple attack penalty, including [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), spell attack rolls, certain skill actions like [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md), and many others.

Some weapons and abilities reduce multiple attack penalties, such as [agile](rules/traits/agile.md) weapons, which reduce these penalties to –4 on the second attack or –8 on further attacks.

| Attack | Multiple Attack Penalty | Agile |
|--------|-------------------------|-------|
| First | None | None |
| Second | –5 | –4 |
| Third or subsequent | –10 | –8 |

Always calculate your multiple attack penalty for the weapon you're using on that attack. For example, let's say you're wielding a [longsword](compendium/equipment/items/longsword.md) in one hand and a [shortsword](compendium/equipment/items/shortsword.md) (which has the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md) trait) in your other hand, and you are going to make three [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) with these weapons during the course of your turn. The first [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) you make during your turn has no penalty, no matter what weapon you are using. The second Strike will take either a –5 penalty if you use the [longsword](compendium/equipment/items/longsword.md) or a –4 penalty if you use the [shortsword](compendium/equipment/items/shortsword.md).

Just like the second attack, the penalty for your third attack is based on which weapon you're using for that particular [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). It would be a –10 penalty with the [longsword](compendium/equipment/items/longsword.md) and a –8 penalty with the [shortsword](compendium/equipment/items/shortsword.md), no matter what weapon you used for your previous [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md).

The multiple attack penalty applies only during your turn, so you don't have to keep track of it if you can perform an Attack of Opportunity or a similar reaction that lets you make a Strike on someone else's turn.

##### Range Penalty
<sup>CRB p. 446</sup>

Ranged and thrown weapons each have a listed range increment, and attacks with them grow less accurate against targets farther away (range and range increments are covered in depth on page 279). As long as your target is at or within the listed range increment, also called the first range increment, you take no penalty to the attack roll. If you're attacking beyond that range increment, you take a –2 penalty for each additional increment beyond the first.

You can attempt to attack with a ranged weapon or thrown weapon up to six range increments away, but the farther away you are, the harder it is to hit your target.

For example, the range increment of a crossbow is 120 feet. If you are shooting at a target no farther away than that distance, you take no penalty due to range. If they're beyond 120 feet but no more than 240 feet away, you take a –2 penalty due to range. If they're beyond 240 feet but no more than 360 feet away, you take a –4 penalty due to range, and so on, until you reach the last range increment: beyond 600 feet but no more than 720 feet away, where you take a –10 penalty due to range.

##### Armor Class
<sup>CRB p. 447</sup>

Attack rolls are compared to a special difficulty class called an **Armor Class** (**AC**), which measures how hard it is for your foes to hit you with [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) and other attack actions. Just like for any other check and DC, the result of an attack roll must meet or exceed your AC to be successful, which allows your foe to deal damage to you.

Armor Class is calculated using the following formula.

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Armor Class = 10 + Dexterity modifier (up to your armor's Dex Cap) + proficiency bonus + armor's item bonus to AC + other bonuses + penalties

Use the proficiency bonus for the category (light, medium, or heavy) or the specific type of armor you're wearing. If you're not wearing armor, use your proficiency in unarmored defense.

Armor Class can benefit from bonuses with a variety of sources, much like attack rolls. Armor itself grants an item bonus, so other item bonuses usually won't apply to your AC, but magic armor can increase the item bonus granted by your armor.

Penalties to AC come from situations and effects in much the same way bonuses do. Circumstance penalties come from unfavorable situations, and status penalties come from effects that impede your abilities or from broken armor. You take an item penalty when you wear shoddy armor (page 273).

> [!pf2-brown] STRIDING AND STRIKING
> 
> Two of the simplest and most common actions you'll use in combat are Stride and Strike, described in full on page 471.
> 
> **[Stride](rules/actions/stride.md)** is an action that has the move trait and that allows you to move a number of feet up to your Speed.
> 
> You'll often need to Stride multiple times to reach a foe who's far away or to run from danger! Move actions can often trigger reactions or free actions. However, unlike other actions, a move action can trigger reactions not only when you first use the action, but also for every 5 feet you move during that action, as described on page 474. The Step action (page 471) lets you move without triggering reactions, but only 5 feet.
> 
> **[Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)** is an action that has the attack trait and that allows you to attack with a weapon you're wielding or an unarmed attack (such as a fist).
> 
> If you're using a melee weapon or unarmed attack, your target must be within your reach; if you're attacking with a ranged weapon, your target must be within range. Your reach is how far you can physically extend a part of your body to make an unarmed attack, or the farthest distance you can reach with a melee weapon. This is typically 5 feet, but special weapons and larger creatures have longer reaches. Your range is how far away you can attack with a ranged weapon or with some types of magical attacks.
> 
> Different weapons and magical attacks have different maximum ranges, and ranged weapons get less effective as you exceed their range increments.
> 
> Striking multiple times in a turn has diminishing returns. The multiple attack penalty (detailed on page 446) applies to each attack after the first, whether those attacks are [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), special attacks like the Grapple action of the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill, or spell attack rolls.

### Spell Attack Rolls
<sup>CRB p. 447</sup>

If you cast spells, you might be able to make a spell attack roll. These rolls are usually made when a spell makes an attack against a creature's AC.

The ability modifier for a spell attack roll depends on how you gained access to your spells. If your class grants you spellcasting, use your key ability modifier. Innate spells use your Charisma modifier unless the ability that granted them states otherwise. Focus spells and other sources of spells specify which ability modifier you use for spell attack rolls in the ability that granted them. If you have spells from multiple sources or traditions, you might use different ability modifiers for spell attack rolls for these different sources of spells. For example, a dwarf cleric with the Stonewalker ancestry feat would use her Charisma modifier when casting [meld into stone](compendium/spells/meld-into-stone.md) from that feat, since it's a divine innate spell, but she would use her Wisdom modifier when casting [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) and other spells using her cleric divine spellcasting.

Determine the spell attack roll with the following formula.

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Spell attack roll result = d20 roll + ability modifier used for spellcasting + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties

If you have the ability to cast spells, you'll have a proficiency rank for your spell attack rolls, so you'll always add a proficiency bonus. Like your ability modifier, this proficiency rank may vary from one spell to another if you have spells from multiple sources. Spell attack rolls can benefit from circumstance bonuses and status bonuses, though item bonuses to spell attack rolls are rare. Penalties affect spell attack rolls just like any other attack roll—including your multiple attack penalty.

Many times, instead of requiring you to make a spell attack roll, the spells you cast will require those within the area or targeted by the spell to attempt a saving throw against your **Spell DC** to determine how the spell affects them.

Your spell DC is calculated using the following formula.

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Spell DC = 10 + ability modifier used for spellcasting + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties

### Perception
<sup>CRB p. 448</sup>

Perception measures your ability to be aware of your environment. Every creature has Perception, which works with and is limited by a creature's senses (described on page 464). Whenever you need to attempt a check based on your awareness, you'll attempt a Perception check.

Your Perception uses your Wisdom modifier, so you'll use the following formula when attempting a Perception check.

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Perception check result = d20 roll + Wisdom modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties

Nearly all creatures are at least trained in Perception, so you will almost always add a proficiency bonus to your Perception modifier. You might add a circumstance bonus for advantageous situations or environments, and typically get status bonuses from spells or other magical effects. Items can also grant you a bonus to Perception, typically in a certain situation. For instance, a fine spyglass grants a +1 item bonus to Perception when attempting to see something a long distance away. Circumstance penalties to Perception occur when an environment or situation (such as fog) hampers your senses, while status penalties typically come from conditions, spells, and magic effects that foil the senses. You'll rarely encounter item penalties or untyped penalties for Perception.

Many abilities are compared to your **Perception DC** to determine whether they succeed. Your Perception DC is 10 + your total Perception modifier.

#### Perception for Initiative
<sup>CRB p. 448</sup>

Often, you'll roll a Perception check to determine your order in initiative. When you do this, instead of comparing the result against a DC, everyone in the encounter will compare their results. The creature with the highest result acts first, the creature with the second-highest result goes second, and so on. Sometimes you may be called on to roll a skill check for initiative instead, but you'll compare results just as if you had rolled Perception. The full rules for initiative are found in the rules for encounter mode on page 468.

### Saving Throws
<sup>CRB p. 448</sup>

There are three types of saving throws: Fortitude saves, Reflex saves, and Will saves. In all cases, saving throws measure your ability to shrug off harmful effects in the form of afflictions, damage, or conditions. You'll always add a proficiency bonus to each save. Your class might give a different proficiency to each save, but you'll be trained at minimum. Some circumstances and spells might give you circumstance or status bonuses to saves, and you might find [resilient](compendium/equipment/items/resilient.md) armor or other magic items that give an item bonus.

**Fortitude saving throws** allow you to reduce the effects of abilities and afflictions that can debilitate the body.

They use your Constitution modifier and are calculated as shown in the formula below.

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Fortitude save result = d20 roll + Constitution modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties

**Reflex saving throws** measure how well you can respond quickly to a situation and how gracefully you can avoid effects that have been thrown at you. They use your Dexterity modifier and are calculated as shown in the formula below.

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Reflex save result = d20 roll + Dexterity modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties

**Will saving throws** measure how well you can resist attacks to your mind and spirit. They use your Wisdom modifier and are calculated as shown in the formula below.

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Will save result = d20 roll + Wisdom modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties

Sometimes you'll need to know your DC for a given saving throw. The DC for a saving throw is 10 + the total modifier for that saving throw.

Most of the time, when you attempt a saving throw, you don't have to use your actions or your reaction. You don't even need to be able to act to attempt saving throws. However, in some special cases you might have to take an action to attempt a save. For instance, you can try to recover from the sickened condition by spending an action to attempt a Fortitude save.

#### Basic Saving Throws
<sup>CRB p. 449</sup>

Sometimes you will be called on to attempt a basic saving throw. This type of saving throw works just like any other saving throw—the "basic" part refers to the effects.

For a basic save, you'll attempt the check and determine whether you critically succeed, succeed, fail, or critically fail like you would any other saving throw. Then one of the following outcomes applies based on your degree of success—no matter what caused the saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You take no damage from the spell, hazard, or effect that caused you to attempt the save.
> - **Success** You take half the listed damage from the effect.
> - **Failure** You take the full damage listed from the effect.

> [!pf2-brown] FORTUNE AND MISFORTUNE EFFECTS
> 
> Fortune and misfortune effects can alter how you roll your dice. These abilities might allow you to reroll a failed roll, force you to reroll a successful roll, allow you to roll twice and use the higher result, or force you to roll twice and use the lower result.
> 
> You can never have more than one fortune and more than one misfortune effect come into play on a single roll. For instance, if an effect lets you roll twice and use the higher roll, you can't then use Halfling Luck (a fortune effect) to reroll if you fail. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If two misfortune effects apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it.
> 
> If both a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

### Skill Checks
<sup>CRB p. 449</sup>

Pathfinder has a variety of skills, from [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) to [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) to [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism). Each grants you a set of related actions that rely on you rolling a skill check. Each skill has a key ability score, based on the scope of the skill in question. For instance, [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) deals with feats of physical prowess, like swimming and jumping, so its key ability score is Strength. [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) deals with the ability to diagnose and treat wounds and ailments, so its key ability score is Wisdom. The key ability score for each skill is listed in Chapter 4: Skills. No matter which skill you're using, you calculate a check for it using the following formula.

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Skill check result = d20 roll + modifier of the skill's key ability score + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties

You're unlikely to be trained in every skill. When using a skill in which you're untrained, your proficiency bonus is +0; otherwise, it equals your level plus 2 for trained, or higher once you become expert or better. The proficiency rank is specific to the skill you're using. Aid from another character or some other beneficial situation may grant you a circumstance bonus. A status bonus might come from a helpful spell or magical effect. Sometimes tools related to the skill grant you an item bonus to your skill checks. Conversely, unfavorable situations might give you a circumstance penalty to your skill check, while harmful spells, magic, or conditions might also impose a status penalty. Using shoddy or makeshift tools might cause you to take an item penalty. Sometimes a skill action can be an attack, and in these cases, the skill check might take a multiple attack penalty, as described on page 446.

When an ability calls for you to use the DC for a specific skill, you can calculate it by adding 10 + your total modifier for that skill.

### Notating Total Modifiers
<sup>CRB p. 450</sup>

When creating your character and adventuring you'll record the total modifier for various important checks on your character sheet. Since many bonuses and penalties are due to the immediate circumstances, spells, and other temporary magical effects, you typically won't apply them to your notations.

Item bonuses and penalties are often more persistent, so you will often want to record them ahead of time. For instance, if you are using a weapon with a +1 weapon potency rune, you'll want to add the +1 item bonus to your notation for your attack rolls with that weapon, since you will include that bonus every time you attack with that weapon. But if you have a fine spyglass, you wouldn't add its item bonus to your Perception check notation, since you gain that bonus only if you are using sight—and the spyglass!—to see long distances.

## Special Checks
<sup>CRB p. 450</sup>

Some categories of checks follow special rules. The most notable are flat checks and secret checks.

### Flat Checks
<sup>CRB p. 450</sup>

When the chance something will happen or fail to happen is based purely on chance, you'll attempt a flat check. A flat check never includes any modifiers, bonuses, or penalties—you just roll a d20 and compare the result on the die to the DC. Only abilities that specifically apply to flat checks can change the checks' DCs; most such effects affect only certain types of flat checks.

If more than one flat check would ever cause or prevent the same thing, just roll once and use the highest DC. In the rare circumstance that a flat check has a DC of 1 or lower, skip rolling; you automatically succeed. Conversely, if one ever has a DC of 21 or higher, you automatically fail.

### Secret Checks
<sup>CRB p. 450</sup>

Sometimes you as the player shouldn't know the exact result and effect of a check. In these situations, the rules (or the GM) will call for a secret check. The secret trait appears on anything that uses secret checks. This type of check uses the same formulas you normally would use for that check, but is rolled by the GM, who doesn't reveal the result. Instead, the GM simply describes the information or effects determined by the check's result. If you don't know a secret check is happening (for instance, if the GM rolls a secret Fortitude save against a poison that you failed to notice), you can't use any fortune or misfortune abilities (see the sidebar on page 449) on that check, but if a fortune or misfortune effect would apply automatically, the GM applies it to the secret check. If you know that the GM is attempting a secret check—as often happens with [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) or Seek—you can usually activate fortune or misfortune abilities for that check. Just tell the GM, and they'll apply the ability to the check.

The GM can choose to make any check secret, even if it's not usually rolled secretly. Conversely, the GM can let you roll any check yourself, even if that check would usually be secret. Some groups find it simpler to have players roll all secret checks and just try to avoid acting on any out-of-character knowledge, while others enjoy the mystery.

## Damage
<sup>CRB p. 450</sup>

In the midst of combat, you attempt checks to determine if you can damage your foe with weapons, spells, or alchemical concoctions. On a successful check, you hit and deal damage. Damage decreases a creature's Hit Points on a 1-to-1 basis (so a creature that takes 6 damage loses 6 Hit Points). The full rules can be found in the Hit Points, Healing, and Dying section on page 459.

Damage is sometimes given as a fixed amount, but more often than not you'll make a damage roll to determine how much damage you deal. A damage roll typically uses a number and type of dice determined by the weapon or unarmed attack used or the spell cast, and it is often enhanced by various modifiers, bonuses, and penalties.

Like checks, a damage roll—especially a melee weapon damage roll—is often modified by a number of modifiers, penalties, and bonuses. When making a damage roll, you take the following steps, explained in detail below.

- Roll the dice indicated by the weapon, unarmed attack, or spell, and apply the modifiers, bonuses, and penalties that apply to the result of the roll.
- Determine the damage type.
- Apply the target's immunities, weaknesses, and resistances to the damage.
- If any damage remains, reduce the target's Hit Points by that amount.

### Step 1: Roll The Damage Dice and Apply Modifiers, Bonuses, and Penalties
<sup>CRB p. 450</sup>

Your weapon, unarmed attack, spell, or sometimes even a magic item determines what type of dice you roll for damage, and how many. For instance, if you're using a normal longsword, you'll roll `1d8`. If you're casting a 3rd-level [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md) spell, you'll roll `6d6`. Sometimes, especially in the case of weapons, you'll apply modifiers, bonuses, and penalties to the damage.

When you use melee weapons, unarmed attacks, and thrown ranged weapons, the most common modifier you'll add to damage is your Strength ability modifier. Weapons with the propulsive trait sometimes add half your Strength modifier. You typically do not add an ability modifier to spell damage, damage from most ranged weapons, or damage from alchemical bombs and similar items.

As with checks, you might add circumstance, status, or item bonuses to your damage rolls, but if you have multiple bonuses of the same type, you add only the highest bonus of that type. Again like checks, you may also apply circumstance, status, item, and untyped penalties to the damage roll, and again you apply only the greatest penalty of a specific type but apply all untyped penalties together.

Use the formulas below.

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Melee damage roll = damage die of weapon or unarmed attack + Strength modifier + bonuses + penalties

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Ranged damage roll = damage die of weapon + Strength modifier for thrown weapons + bonuses + penalties

> [!pf2-inset] 
> 
> Spell (and similar effects) damage roll = damage die of the effect + bonuses + penalties

If the combined penalties on an attack would reduce the damage to 0 or below, you still deal 1 damage.

#### Increasing Damage
<sup>CRB p. 451</sup>

In some cases, you increase the number of dice you roll when making weapon damage rolls. Magic weapons etched with the [striking](compendium/equipment/items/striking.md) rune can add one or more weapon damage dice to your damage roll. These extra dice are the same die size as the weapon's damage die. At certain levels, most characters gain the ability to deal extra damage from the weapon specialization class feature.

#### Persistent Damage
<sup>CRB p. 451</sup>

Persistent damage is a condition that causes damage to recur beyond the original effect. Unlike with normal damage, when you are subject to persistent damage, you don't take it right away. Instead, you take the specified damage at the end of your turns, after which you attempt a DC 15 flat check to see if you recover from the persistent damage.

Like normal damage, it can be doubled or halved based on the results of an attack roll or saving throw.

See the Conditions Appendix on pages 618–623 for the complete rules regarding the persistent damage condition.

#### Doubling and Halving Damage
<sup>CRB p. 451</sup>

Sometimes you'll need to halve or double an amount of damage, such as when the outcome of your Strike is a critical hit, or when you succeed at a basic Reflex save against a spell. When this happens, you roll the damage normally, adding all the normal modifiers, bonuses, and penalties. Then you double or halve the amount as appropriate (rounding down if you halved it). The GM might allow you to roll the dice twice and double the modifiers, bonuses, and penalties instead of doubling the entire result, but this usually works best for singletarget attacks or spells at low levels when you have a small number of damage dice to roll. Benefits you gain specifically from a critical hit, like the [flaming](compendium/equipment/items/flaming.md) weapon rune's persistent fire damage or the extra damage die from the fatal weapon trait, aren't doubled.

### Step 2: Determine The Damage Type
<sup>CRB p. 451</sup>

Once you've calculated how much damage you deal, you'll need to determine the damage type. There are many types of damage and sometimes certain types are applied in different ways. The smack of a club deals bludgeoning damage. The stab of a spear deals piercing damage. The staccato crack of a [lightning bolt](compendium/spells/lightning-bolt.md) spell deals electricity damage. Sometimes you might apply precision damage, dealing more damage for hitting a creature in a vulnerable spot or when the target is somehow vulnerable. The damage types are described on page 452.

#### Damage Types and Traits
<sup>CRB p. 451</sup>

When an attack deals a type of damage, the attack action gains that trait. For example, the [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) and attack actions you use wielding a sword when its [flaming](compendium/equipment/items/flaming.md) rune is active gain the fire trait, since the rune gives the weapon the ability to deal fire damage.

> [!pf2-brown] DAMAGE TYPES
> 
> Damage has a number of different types and categories, which are described below.
> 
> ### Physical Damage
> <sup>CRB p. 451</sup>
> 
> Damage dealt by weapons, many physical hazards, and a handful of spells is collectively called physical damage. The main types of physical damage are bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. **Bludgeoning damage** comes from weapons and hazards that deal blunt-force trauma, like a hit from a club or being dashed against rocks. **Piercing damage** is dealt from stabs and punctures, whether from a dragon's fangs or the thrust of a spear. **Slashing damage** is delivered by a cut, be it the swing of the sword or the blow from a scythe blades trap.
> 
> Ghosts and other incorporeal creatures have a high resistance to physical attacks that aren't magical (attacks that lack the magical trait). Furthermore, most incorporeal creatures have additional, though lower, resistance to magical physical damage (such as damage dealt from a mace with the magical trait) and most other damage types.
> 
> ### Energy Damage
> <sup>CRB p. 451</sup>
> 
> Many spells and other magical effects deal energy damage. Energy damage is also dealt from effects in the world, such as the biting cold of a blizzard to a raging forest fire. The main types of energy damage are acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic. **Acid damage** can be delivered by gases, liquids, and certain solids that dissolve flesh, and sometimes harder materials. **Cold damage** freezes material by way of contact with chilling gases and ice. **Electricity Damage** comes from the discharge of powerful lightning and sparks. **Fire damage** burns through heat and combustion. **Sonic damage** assaults matter with high-frequency vibration and sound waves. Many times, you deal energy damage by casting magic spells, and doing so is often useful against creatures that have immunities or resistances to physical damage.
> 
> Two special types of energy damage specifically target the living and the undead. Positive energy often manifests as healing energy to living creatures but can create **positive damage** that withers undead bodies and disrupts and injures incorporeal undead. Negative energy often revivifies the unnatural, unliving power of undead, while manifesting as **negative damage** that gnaws at the living.
> 
> Powerful and pure magical energy can manifest itself as **force damage**. Few things can resist this type of damage—not even incorporeal creatures such as ghosts and wraiths.
> 
> ### Alignment Damage
> <sup>CRB p. 451</sup>
> 
> Weapons and effects keyed to a particular alignment can deal **chaotic**, **evil**, **good**, or **lawful** damage. These damage types apply only to creatures that have the opposing alignment trait. Chaotic damage harms only lawful creatures, evil damage harms only good creatures, good damage harms only evil creatures, and lawful damage harms only chaotic creatures.
> 
> ### Mental Damage
> <sup>CRB p. 451</sup>
> 
> Sometimes an effect can target the mind with enough psychic force to actually deal damage to the creature. When it does, it deals **mental damage**. Mindless creatures and those with only programmed or rudimentary intelligence are often immune to mental damage and effects.
> 
> ### Poison Damage
> <sup>CRB p. 451</sup>
> 
> Venoms, toxins and the like can deal **poison damage**, which affects creatures by way of contact, ingestion, inhalation, or injury. In addition to coming from monster attacks, alchemical items, and spells, poison damage is often caused by ongoing afflictions, which follow special rules described on page 457.
> 
> ### Bleed Damage
> <sup>CRB p. 451</sup>
> 
> Another special type of physical damage is **bleed damage**. This is persistent damage that represents loss of blood.
> 
> As such, it has no effect on nonliving creatures or living creatures that don't need blood to live. Weaknesses and resistances to physical damage apply. Bleed damage ends automatically if you're healed to your full Hit Points.
> 
> ### Precision Damage
> <sup>CRB p. 451</sup>
> 
> Sometimes you are able to make the most of your attack through sheer precision. When you hit with an ability that grants you **precision damage**, you increase the attack's listed damage, using the same damage type, rather than tracking a separate pool of damage. For example, a non-magical dagger Strike that deals 1d6 precision damage from a rogue's sneak attack increases the piercing damage by 1d6.
> 
> Some creatures are immune to precision damage, regardless of the damage type; these are often amorphous creatures that lack vulnerable anatomy. A creature immune to precision damage would ignore the 1d6 precision damage in the example above, but it would still take the rest of the piercing damage from the Strike. Since precision damage is always the same type of damage as the attack it's augmenting, a creature that is resistant to physical damage, like a gargoyle, would resist not only the dagger's damage but also the precision damage, even though it is not specifically resistant to precision damage.
> 
> ### Precious Materials
> <sup>CRB p. 451</sup>
> 
> While not their own damage category, precious materials can modify damage to penetrate a creature's resistances or take advantage of its weaknesses. For instance, silver weapons are particularly effective against lycanthropes and bypass the resistances to physical damage that most devils have.

### Step 3: Apply the Target's Immunities, Weaknesses, and Resistances
<sup>CRB p. 451</sup>

Defenses against certain types of damage or effects are called immunities or resistances, while vulnerabilities are called weaknesses. Apply immunities first, then weaknesses, and resistances third. Immunity, weakness, or resistance to an alignment applies only to damage of that type, not to damage from an attacking creature of that alignment.

#### Immunity
<sup>CRB p. 451</sup>

When you have immunity to a specific type of damage, you ignore all damage of that type. If you have immunity to a specific condition or type of effect, you can't be affected by that condition or any effect of that type. If you have immunity to effects with a certain trait (such as death effects, poison, or disease) you are unaffected by any effect with that trait. Often, an effect can be both a trait and a damage type (this is especially true in the case of energy damage types). In these cases, the immunity applies to the entire effect, not just the damage. You can still be targeted by an ability with an effect you are immune to; you just don't apply the effect. However, some complex effects might have parts that affect you even if you're immune to one of the effect's traits; for instance, a spell that deals both fire and acid damage can still deal acid damage to you even if you're immune to fire.

Immunity to critical hits works a little differently. When a creature immune to critical hits is critically hit by a Strike or other attack that deals damage, it takes normal damage instead of double damage. This does not make it immune to any other critical success effects of other actions that have the attack trait (such as [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) and [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md)).

Another exception is immunity to nonlethal attacks. If you are immune to nonlethal attacks, you are immune to all damage from attacks with the nonlethal trait, no matter what other type the damage has. For instance, a stone golem has immunity to nonlethal attacks. This means that no matter how hard you hit it with your fist, you're not going to damage it—unless your fists don't have the [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md) trait, such as if you're a monk.

#### Temporary Immunity
<sup>CRB p. 453</sup>

Some effects grant you immunity to the same effect for a set amount of time. If an effect grants you temporary immunity, repeated applications of that effect don't affect you for as long as the temporary immunity lasts. Unless the effect says it applies only to a certain creature's ability, it doesn't matter who created the effect. For example, the [blindness](compendium/spells/blindness.md) spell says, "The target is temporarily immune to blindness for 1 minute." If anyone casts [blindness](compendium/spells/blindness.md) on that creature again before 1 minute passes, the spell has no effect.

Temporary immunity doesn't prevent or end ongoing effects of the source of the temporary immunity. For instance, if an ability makes you frightened and you then gain temporary immunity to the ability, you don't immediately lose the frightened condition due to the immunity you just gained—you simply don't become frightened if you're targeted by the ability again before the immunity ends.

#### Weakness
<sup>CRB p. 453</sup>

If you have a weakness to a certain type of damage or damage from a certain source, that type of damage is extra effective against you. Whenever you would take that type of damage, increase the damage you take by the value of the weakness. For instance, if you are dealt 2d6 fire damage and have weakness 5 to fire, you take 2d6+5 fire damage.

If you have a weakness to something that doesn't normally deal damage, such as water, you take damage equal to the weakness value when touched or affected by it. If more than one weakness would apply to the same instance of damage, use only the highest applicable weakness value. This usually happens only when a monster is weak to both a type of physical damage and a given material.

#### Resistance
<sup>CRB p. 453</sup>

If you have resistance to a type of damage, each time you take that type of damage, you reduce the amount of damage you take by the listed amount (to a minimum of 0 damage). Resistance can specify combinations of damage types or other traits. For instance, you might encounter a monster that's resistant to non-magical bludgeoning damage, meaning it would take less damage from bludgeoning attacks that weren't magical, but would take normal damage from your mace (since it's magical) or a non-magical [spear](compendium/equipment/items/spear.md) (since it deals piercing damage). A resistance also might have an exception. For example, resistance 10 to physical damage (except silver) would reduce any physical damage by 10 unless that damage was dealt by a silver weapon.

If you have more than one type of resistance that would apply to the same instance of damage, use only the highest applicable resistance value.

It's possible to have resistance to all damage. When an effect deals damage of multiple types and you have resistance to all damage, apply the resistance to each type of damage separately. If an attack would deal 7 slashing damage and 4 fire damage, resistance 5 to all damage would reduce the slashing damage to 2 and negate the fire damage entirely.

### Step 4: If Damage Remains, Reduce the Target's Hit Points
<sup>CRB p. 453</sup>

After applying the target's immunities, resistances, and weaknesses to the damage, whatever damage is left reduces the target's Hit Points on a 1-to-1 basis. More information about Hit Points can be found in the Hit Points, Healing, and Dying section on page 459.

#### Nonlethal Attacks
<sup>CRB p. 453</sup>

You can make a nonlethal attack in an effort to knock someone out instead of killing them (see Knocked Out and Dying on page 459). Weapons with the nonlethal trait (including fists) do this automatically. You take a –2 circumstance penalty to the attack roll when you make a nonlethal attack using a weapon that doesn't have the nonlethal trait. You also take this penalty when making a lethal attack using a nonlethal weapon.

Spells and other effects with the nonlethal trait that reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points knock the creature out instead of killing them.

## Conditions
<sup>CRB p. 453</sup>

The results of various checks might apply conditions to you or, less often, an item. Conditions change your state of being in some way. You might be gripped with fear or made faster by a spell or magic item. One condition represents what happens when a creature successfully drains your blood or life essence, while others represent creatures' attitudes toward you and how they interact with you.

Conditions are persistent; when you're affected by a condition, its effects last until the stated duration ends, the condition is removed, or terms dictated in the condition cause it to end. The rules for conditions are summarized on page 454 and described in full on pages 618–623.

## Effects
<sup>CRB p. 453</sup>

Anything you do in the game has an **effect**. Many of these outcomes are easy to adjudicate during the game.

If you tell the GM that you draw your sword, no check is needed, and the result is that your character is now holding a sword. Other times, the specific effect requires more detailed rules governing how your choice is resolved.

Many spells, magic items, and feats create specific effects, and your character will be subject to effects caused by monsters, hazards, the environment, and other characters.

While a check might determine the overall impact or strength of an effect, a check is not always part of creating an effect. Casting a [fly](compendium/spells/fly.md) spell on yourself creates an effect that allows you to soar through the air, but casting the spell does not require a check. Conversely, using the Intimidate skill to Demoralize a foe does require a check, and your result on that check determines the effect's outcome.

The following general rules are used to understand and apply effects.

### Duration
<sup>CRB p. 455</sup>

Most effects are discrete, creating an instantaneous effect when you let the GM know what actions you are going to use. Firing a bow, moving to a new space, or taking something out of your pack all resolve instantly. Other effects instead last for a certain duration. Once the duration has elapsed, the effect ends. The rules generally use the following conventions for durations, though spells have some special durations detailed on pages 304–305.

For an effect that lasts a number of rounds, the remaining duration decreases by 1 at the start of each turn of the creature that created the effect. This is common for beneficial effects that target you or your allies. Detrimental effects often last "until the end of the target's next turn" or "through" a number of their turns (such as "through the target's next 3 turns"), which means that the effect's duration decreases at the end of the creature's turn, rather than the start.

Instead of lasting a fixed number of rounds, a duration might end only when certain conditions are met (or cease to be true). If so, the effects last until those conditions are met.

### Range and Reach
<sup>CRB p. 455</sup>

Actions and other abilities that generate an effect typically work within a specified range or a reach. Most spells and abilities list a **range**—the maximum distance from the creature or object creating the effect in which the effect can occur.

Ranged and thrown weapons have a **range increment**.

Attacks with such weapons work normally up to that range. Attacks against targets beyond that range take a –2 penalty, which worsens by 2 for every additional multiple of that range, to a maximum of a –10 penalty after five additional range increments. Attacks beyond this range are not possible. For example, if you are using a shortbow, your attacks take no penalty against a target up to 60 feet away, a –2 penalty if a target is over 60 and up to 120 feet away, a –4 if a target is over 120 and up to 180 feet away, and so on, up to a maximum distance of 360 feet.

**Reach** is how far you can physically reach with your body or a weapon. Melee [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) rely on reach. Your reach also creates an area around your space where other creatures could trigger your reactions. Your reach is typically 5 feet, but weapons with the reach trait can extend this. Larger creatures can have greater reach; for instance, an ogre has a 10-foot reach. Unlike with measuring most distances, 10-foot reach can reach 2 squares diagonally. Reach greater than 10 feet is measured normally; 20-foot reach can reach 3 squares diagonally, 25-foot reach can reach 4, and so on.

### Targets
<sup>CRB p. 455</sup>

Some effects require you to choose specific targets.

Targeting can be difficult or impossible if your chosen creature is undetected by you, if the creature doesn't match restrictions on who you can target, or if some other ability prevents it from being targeted.

Some effects require a target to be willing. Only you can decide whether your PC is willing, and the GM decides whether an NPC is willing. Even if you or your character don't know what the effect is, such as if your character is unconscious, you still decide if you're willing.

Some effects target or require an ally, or otherwise refer to an ally. This must be someone on your side, often another PC, but it might be a bystander you are trying to protect. You are not your own ally. If it isn't clear, the GM decides who counts as an ally or an enemy.

### Areas
<sup>CRB p. 456</sup>

Some effects occupy an area of a specified shape and size.

An area effect always has a point of origin and extends out from that point. There are four types of areas: emanations, bursts, cones, and lines. When you're playing in encounter mode and using a grid, areas are measured in the same way as movement (page 463), but areas' distances are never reduced or affected by difficult terrain or lesser cover (page 476). You can use the diagrams below as common reference templates for areas, rather than measuring squares each time. Many area effects describe only the effects on creatures in the area. The GM determines any effects to the environment and unattended objects.

#### Burst
<sup>CRB p. 456</sup>

A burst effect issues forth in all directions from a single corner of a square within the range of the effect, spreading in all directions to a specified radius. For instance, when you cast [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md), it detonates at the corner of a square within 500 feet of you and creates a 20-foot burst, meaning it extends out 20 feet in every direction from the corner of the square you chose, affecting each creature whose space (or even one square of its space) is within the burst.

#### Cone
<sup>CRB p. 457</sup>

A cone shoots out from you in a quarter circle on the grid.

When you aim a cone, the first square of that cone must share an edge with your space if you're aiming orthogonally, or it must touch a corner of your space if you're aiming diagonally. If you're Large or larger, the first square can run along the edge of any square of your space. You can't aim a cone so that it overlaps your space. The cone extends out for a number of feet, widening as it goes, as shown in the Areas diagram. For instance, when a green dragon uses its breath weapon, it breathes a cone of poisonous gas that originates at the edge of one square of its space and affects a quarter-circle area 30 feet on each edge.

If you make a cone originate from someone or something else, follow these same rules, with the first square of the cone using an edge or corner of that creature or object's space instead of your own.

#### Emanation
<sup>CRB p. 457</sup>

An emanation issues forth from each side of your space, extending out to a specified number of feet in all directions. For instance, the [bless](compendium/spells/bless.md) spell's emanation radiates 5 or more feet outward from the caster. Because the sides of a creature's space are the starting point for the emanation, an emanation from a Large or larger creature affects a greater overall area than that of a Medium or smaller creature. Unless the text states otherwise, the creature creating an emanation effect chooses whether the creature at its center is affected.

#### Line
<sup>CRB p. 457</sup>

A line shoots forth from you in a straight line in a direction of your choosing. The line affects each creature whose space it overlaps. Unless a line effect says otherwise, it is 5 feet wide. For example, the [lightning bolt](compendium/spells/lightning-bolt.md) spell's area is a 60-foot line that's 5 feet wide.

### Line of Effect
<sup>CRB p. 457</sup>

When creating an effect, you usually need an unblocked path to the target of a spell, the origin point of an effect's area, or the place where you create something with a spell or other ability. This is called a line of effect. You have line of effect unless a creature is entirely behind a solid physical barrier. Visibility doesn't matter for line of effect, nor do portcullises and other barriers that aren't totally solid. If you're unsure whether a barrier is solid enough, usually a 1-foot-square gap is enough to maintain a line of effect, though the GM makes the final call.

In an area effect, creatures or targets must have line of effect to the point of origin to be affected. If there's no line of effect between the origin of the area and the target, the effect doesn't apply to that target. For example, if there's a solid wall between the origin of a [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md) and a creature that's within the burst radius, the wall blocks the effect—that creature is unaffected by the [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md) and doesn't need to attempt a save against it. Likewise, any ongoing effects created by an ability with an area cease to affect anyone who moves outside of the line of effect.

### Line of Sight
<sup>CRB p. 457</sup>

Some effects require you to have line of sight to your target. As long as you can precisely sense the area (as described in Perception on page 464) and it is not blocked by a solid barrier (as described in Cover), you have line of sight. An area of darkness prevents line of sight if you don't have [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md), but portcullises and other obstacles that aren't totally solid do not. If you're unsure whether a barrier is solid enough to block line of sight, usually a 1-foot-square gap is enough to maintain line of sight, though the GM makes the final call.

## Afflictions
<sup>CRB p. 457</sup>

Diseases and poisons are types of afflictions, as are curses and radiation. An affliction can infect a creature for a long time, progressing through different and often increasingly debilitating stages. The level of an affliction is the level of the monster, hazard, or item causing the affliction or, in the case of a spell, is listed in the affliction entry for that spell.

### Format
<sup>CRB p. 457</sup>

Whether appearing in a spell, as an item, or within a creature's stat block, afflictions appear in the following format.

#### Name and Traits
<sup>CRB p. 457</sup>

The affliction's name is given first, followed by its traits in parentheses—including the trait for the type of affliction (curse, disease, poison, and so forth). If the affliction needs to have a level specified, it follows the parentheses, followed by any unusual details, such as restrictions on removing the conditions imposed by an affliction.

#### Saving Throw
<sup>CRB p. 457</sup>

When you're first exposed to the affliction, you must attempt a saving throw against it. This first attempt to stave off the affliction is called the initial save. An affliction usually requires a Fortitude save, but the exact save and its DC are listed after the name and type of affliction. Spells that can poison you typically use the caster's spell DC.

On a successful initial saving throw, you are unaffected by that exposure to the affliction. You do not need to attempt further saving throws against it unless you are exposed to the affliction again.

If you fail the initial saving throw, after the affliction's onset period elapses (if applicable), you advance to stage 1 of the affliction and are subjected to the listed effect. On a critical failure, after its onset period (if applicable), you advance to stage 2 of the affliction and are subjected to that effect instead. The stages of an affliction are described below.

#### Onset
<sup>CRB p. 458</sup>

Some afflictions have onset times. For these afflictions, once you fail your initial save, you don't gain the effects for the first stage of the affliction until the onset time has elapsed. If this entry is absent, you gain the effects for the first stage (or the second stage on a critical failure) immediately upon failing the initial saving throw.

#### Maximum Duration
<sup>CRB p. 458</sup>

If an affliction lasts only a limited amount of time, it lists a maximum duration. Once this duration passes, the affliction ends. Otherwise, the affliction lasts until you succeed at enough saves to recover, as described in Stages below.

#### Stages
<sup>CRB p. 458</sup>

An affliction typically has multiple stages, each of which lists an effect followed by an interval in parentheses. When you reach a given stage of an affliction, you are subjected to the effects listed for that stage.

At the end of a stage's listed interval, you must attempt a new saving throw. On a success, you reduce the stage by 1; on a critical success, you reduce the stage by 2. You are then subjected to the effects of the new stage. If the affliction's stage is ever reduced below stage 1, the affliction ends and you don't need to attempt further saves unless you're exposed to the affliction again.

On a failure, the stage increases by 1; on a critical failure, the stage increases by 2. You are then subjected to the effects listed for the new stage. If a failure or critical failure would increase the stage beyond the highest listed stage, the affliction instead repeats the effects of the highest stage.

### Conditions from Afflictions
<sup>CRB p. 458</sup>

An affliction might give you conditions with a longer or shorter duration than the affliction. For instance, if an affliction causes you to be drained but has a maximum duration of 5 minutes, you remain drained even after the affliction ends, as is normal for the drained condition. Or, you might succeed at the flat check to remove persistent damage you took from an ongoing affliction, but you would still need to attempt saves to remove the affliction itself, and failing one might give you new persistent damage.

### Multiple Exposures
<sup>CRB p. 458</sup>

Multiple exposures to the same curse or disease currently affecting you have no effect. For a poison, however, failing the initial saving throw against a new exposure increases the stage by 1 (or by 2 if you critically fail) without affecting the maximum duration. This is true even if you're within the poison's onset period, though it doesn't change the onset length.

### Virulent Afflictions
<sup>CRB p. 458</sup>

Afflictions with the [virulent](rules/traits/virulent.md) trait are harder to remove.

You must succeed at two consecutive saves to reduce a virulent affliction's stage by 1. A critical success reduces a virulent affliction's stage by only 1 instead of by 2.

## Counteracting
<sup>CRB p. 458</sup>

Some effects try to counteract spells, afflictions, conditions, or other effects. Counteract checks compare the power of two forces and determine which defeats the other. Successfully counteracting an effect ends it unless noted otherwise.

When attempting a counteract check, add the relevant skill modifier or other appropriate modifier to your check against the target's DC. If you're counteracting an affliction, the DC is in the affliction's stat block. If it's a spell, use the caster's DC. The GM can also calculate a DC based on the target effect's level. For spells, the counteract check modifier is your spellcasting ability modifier plus your spellcasting proficiency bonus, plus any bonuses and penalties that specifically apply to counteract checks. What you can counteract depends on the check result and the target's level. If an effect is a spell, its level is the counteract level.

Otherwise, halve its level and round up to determine its counteract level. If an effect's level is unclear and it came from a creature, halve and round up the creature's level.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Counteract the target if its counteract level is no more than 3 levels higher than your effect's counteract level.
> - **Success** Counteract the target if its counteract level is no more than 1 level higher than your effect's counteract level.
> - **Failure** Counteract the target if its counteract level is lower than your effect's counteract level.
> - **Critical Failure** You fail to counteract the target.

## Hit Points, Healing, and Dying
<sup>CRB p. 459</sup>

All creatures and objects have Hit Points (HP). Your maximum Hit Point value represents your health, wherewithal, and heroic drive when you are in good health and rested. Your maximum Hit Points include the Hit Points you gain at 1st level from your ancestry and class, those you gain at higher levels from your class, and any you gain from other sources (like the Toughness general feat). When you take damage, you reduce your current Hit Points by a number equal to the damage dealt.

Some spells, items, and other effects, as well as simply resting, can heal living or undead creatures. When you are healed, you regain Hit Points equal to the amount healed, up to your maximum Hit Points.

### Knocked Out and Dying
<sup>CRB p. 459</sup>

Creatures cannot be reduced to fewer than 0 Hit Points.

When most creatures reach 0 Hit Points, they die and are removed from play unless the attack was nonlethal, in which case they are instead knocked out for a significant amount of time (usually 1 minute or more). When undead and construct creatures reach 0 Hit Points, they are destroyed.

Player characters, their companions, and other significant characters and creatures don't automatically die when they reach 0 Hit Points. Instead, they are knocked out and are at risk of death. At the GM's discretion, villains, powerful monsters, special NPCs, and enemies with special abilities that are likely to bring them back to the fight (like ferocity, regeneration, or healing magic) can use these rules as well.

As a player character, when you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, you're knocked out with the following effects:

- You immediately move your initiative position to directly before the turn in which you were reduced to 0 HP.
- You gain the [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition. If the effect that knocked you out was a critical success from the attacker or the result of your critical failure, you gain the [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition instead. If you have the [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition (page 460), increase your [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) value by an amount equal to your [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) value. If the damage was dealt by a nonlethal attack or nonlethal effect, you don't gain the dying condition; you are instead unconscious with 0 Hit Points.

#### Taking Damage while Dying
<sup>CRB p. 459</sup>

If you take damage while you already have the dying condition, increase your dying condition value by 1, or by 2 if the damage came from an attacker's critical hit or your own critical failure. If you have the wounded condition, remember to add the value of your wounded condition to your dying value.

### Recovery Checks
<sup>CRB p. 459</sup>

When you're dying, at the start of each of your turns, you must attempt a flat check with a DC equal to 10 + your current dying value to see if you get better or worse. This is called a recovery check. The effects of this check are as follows.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Your [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) value is reduced by 2.
> - **Success** Your [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) value is reduced by 1.
> - **Failure** Your [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) value increases by 1.
> - **Critical Failure** Your [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) value increases by 2.

### Conditions Related to Death and Dying
<sup>CRB p. 459</sup>

To understand the rules for getting knocked out and how dying works in the game, you'll need some more information on the conditions used in those rules.

Presented below are the rules for the [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying), [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), wounded, and doomed conditions.

#### Dying
<sup>CRB p. 459</sup>

You are bleeding out or otherwise at death's door. While you have this condition, you are unconscious. Dying always includes a value. If this value ever reaches dying 4, you die. If you're dying, you must attempt a recovery check at the start of your turn each round to determine whether you get better or worse.

If you lose the [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition by succeeding at a recovery check and are still at 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious, but you can wake up as described on page 460. You lose the dying condition automatically and wake up if you ever have 1 Hit Point or more. Anytime you lose the dying condition, you gain the wounded 1 condition, or increase your wounded value by 1 if you already have that condition.

#### Unconscious
<sup>CRB p. 459</sup>

You're sleeping, or you've been knocked out. You can't act.

You take a –4 status penalty to AC, Perception, and Reflex saves, and you have the blinded and [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) conditions.

When you gain this condition, you fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) and drop items you are wielding or holding unless the effect states otherwise or the GM determines you're in a position in which you wouldn't.

**If you're [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) because you're [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying)**, you can't wake up as long as you have 0 Hit Points. If you're restored to 1 Hit Point or more via healing, you lose the dying and unconscious conditions and can act normally on your next turn.

If you are [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and at 0 Hit Points, but not **dying**, you naturally return to 1 Hit Point and awaken after sufficient time passes. The GM determines how long you remain unconscious, from a minimum of 10 minutes to several hours. If you receive healing during this time, you lose the unconscious condition and can act normally on your next turn.

If you're [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and have more than 1 Hit Point (typically because you are asleep or unconscious due to an effect), you wake up in one of the following ways.

Each causes you to lose the [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) condition.

- You take damage, provided the damage doesn't reduce you to 0 Hit Points. (If the damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you remain [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and gain the [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition as normal.)
- You receive healing, other than the natural healing you get from resting.
- Someone nudges or shakes you awake using an Interact action.
- Loud noise is being made around you—though this isn't automatic. At the start of your turn, you automatically attempt a Perception check against the noise's DC (or the lowest DC if there is more than one noise), waking up if you succeed. This is often DC 5 for a battle, but if creatures are attempting to stay quiet around you, this Perception check uses their [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) DC. Some magical effects make you sleep so deeply that they don't allow you to attempt this Perception check.
- If you are simply asleep, the GM decides you wake up either because you have had a restful night's sleep or something disrupted that rest.

#### Wounded
<sup>CRB p. 460</sup>

You have been seriously injured during a fight. Anytime you lose the dying condition, you become wounded 1 if you didn't already have the wounded condition. If you already have the wounded condition, your wounded condition value instead increases by 1. If you gain the dying condition while wounded, increase the dying condition's value by your wounded value. The wounded condition ends if someone successfully restores Hit Points to you with Treat Wounds, or if you are restored to full Hit Points and rest for 10 minutes.

#### Doomed
<sup>CRB p. 460</sup>

Your life is ebbing away, bringing you ever closer to death. Some powerful spells and evil creatures can inflict the doomed condition on you. Doomed always includes a value. The maximum dying value at which you die is reduced by your doomed value. For example, if you were [doomed](rules/conditions.md#Doomed), you would die upon reaching dying 3 instead of dying 4. If your maximum dying value is ever reduced to 0, you instantly die. When you die, you're no longer doomed.

Your [doomed](rules/conditions.md#Doomed) value decreases by 1 each time you get a full night's rest.

### Death
<sup>CRB p. 460</sup>

After you die you lose all your actions, and you can't act or be affected by spells that target creatures (unless they specifically target dead creatures), and for all other purposes you are an object. When you die, you are reduced to 0 Hit Points if you had a different amount, and you can't be brought above 0 Hit Points as long as you remain dead. Some magic can bring creatures back to life, such as the [resurrect](compendium/spells/rituals/resurrect.md) ritual or the [raise dead](compendium/spells/raise-dead.md) spell.

### Heroic Recovery
<sup>CRB p. 460</sup>

If you have at least 1 Hero Point (page 467), you can spend all of your remaining Hero Points at the start of your turn or when your dying value would increase. You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilize with 0 Hit Points. You don't gain the wounded condition or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way, but if you already had that condition, you don't lose it or decrease its value. You lose the dying condition and become conscious. You do not gain the wounded condition (or increase its value) when you perform a heroic recovery.

### Death Effects and Instant Death
<sup>CRB p. 461</sup>

Some spells and abilities can kill you immediately or bring you closer to death without needing to reduce you to 0 Hit Points first. These abilities have the death trait and usually involve negative energy, the antithesis of life. If you are reduced to 0 Hit Points by a death effect, you are slain instantly without needing to reach dying 4. If an effect states it kills you outright, you die without having to reach dying 4 and without being reduced to 0 Hit Points.

### Massive Damage
<sup>CRB p. 461</sup>

You die instantly if you ever take damage equal to or greater than double your maximum Hit Points in one blow.

### Temporary Hit Points
<sup>CRB p. 461</sup>

Some spells or abilities give you temporary Hit Points.

Track these separately from your current and maximum Hit Points; when you take damage, reduce your temporary Hit Points first. Most temporary Hit Points last for a limited duration. You can't regain lost temporary Hit Points through healing, but you can gain more via other abilities. You can have temporary Hit Points from only one source at a time. If you gain temporary Hit Points when you already have some, choose whether to keep the amount you already have and their corresponding duration or to gain the new temporary Hit Points and their duration.

### Fast Healing and Regeneration
<sup>CRB p. 461</sup>

A creature with fast healing or regeneration regains the listed amount of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. A creature with regeneration has additional benefits. Its dying condition can't increase to a value that would kill it (this stops most creatures from going beyond dying 3) as long as its regeneration is active. If it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn, including against the triggering damage.

### Items and Hit Points
<sup>CRB p. 461</sup>

Items have Hit Points like creatures, but the rules for damaging them are different (page 272). An item has a Hardness statistic that reduces damage the item takes by that amount. The item then takes any damage left over. If an item is reduced to 0 HP, it's destroyed. An item also has a Broken Threshold. If its HP are reduced to this amount or lower, it's broken, meaning it can't be used for its normal function and it doesn't grant bonuses. Damaging an unattended item usually requires attacking it directly, and can be difficult due to that item's Hardness and immunities. You usually can't attack an attended object (one on a creature's person).

## Actions
<sup>CRB p. 461</sup>

You affect the world around you primarily by using actions, which produce effects. Actions are most closely measured and restricted during the encounter mode of play, but even when it isn't important for you to keep strict track of actions, they remain the way in which you interact with the game world. There are four types of actions: single actions, activities, reactions, and free actions.

**Single actions** can be completed in a very short time. They're self-contained, and their effects are generated within the span of that single action. During an encounter, you get 3 actions at the beginning of your turn, which you can use as described on page 468.

**Activities** usually take longer and require using multiple actions, which must be spent in succession. Stride is a single action, but Sudden Charge is an activity in which you use both the Stride and Strike actions to generate its effect.

**Reactions** have triggers, which must be met for you to use the reaction. You can use a reaction anytime its trigger is met, whether it's your turn or not. In an encounter, you get 1 reaction each round, which you can use as described on page 468. Outside of encounters, your use of reactions is more flexible and up to the GM. Reactions are usually triggered by other creatures or by events outside your control.

**Free actions** don't cost you any of your actions per turn, nor do they cost your reaction. A free action with no trigger follows the same rules as a single action (except the action cost), and a free action with a trigger follows the same rules as a reaction (except the reaction cost).

> 
> [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") Free Action

### Activities
<sup>CRB p. 461</sup>

An activity typically involves using multiple actions to create an effect greater than you can produce with a single action, or combining multiple single actions to produce an effect that's different from merely the sum of those actions. In some cases, usually when spellcasting, an activity can consist of only 1 action, 1 reaction, or even 1 free action.

An activity might cause you to use specific actions within it. You don't have to spend additional actions to perform them—they're already factored into the activity's required actions. (See Subordinate Actions on page 462.) You have to spend all the actions of an activity at once to gain its effects. In an encounter, this means you must complete it during your turn. If an activity gets interrupted or disrupted in an encounter (page 462), you lose all the actions you committed to it.

#### Exploration and Downtime Activities
<sup>CRB p. 461</sup>

Outside of encounters, activities can take minutes, hours, or even days. These activities usually have the exploration or downtime trait to indicate they're meant to be used during these modes of play. You can often do other things off and on as you carry out these activities, provided they aren't significant activities of their own. For instance, if you're Repairing an item, you might move around to stretch your legs or have a brief discussion—but you couldn't also Decipher Writing at the same time.

If an activity that occurs outside of an encounter is interrupted or disrupted, as described in Disrupting Actions below, you usually lose the time you put in, but no additional time beyond that.

> [!pf2-brown] IN-DEPTH ACTION RULES
> 
> These rules clarify some of the specifics of using actions.
> 
> ### Simultaneous Actions
> <sup>CRB p. 462</sup>
> 
> You can use only one single action, activity, or free action that doesn't have a trigger at a time. You must complete one before beginning another. For example, the Sudden Charge activity states you must Stride twice and then Strike, so you couldn't use an Interact action to open a door in the middle of the movement, nor could you perform part of the move, make your attack, and then finish the move.
> 
> Free actions with triggers and reactions work differently. You can use these whenever the trigger occurs, even if the trigger occurs in the middle of another action.
> 
> ### Subordinate Actions
> <sup>CRB p. 462</sup>
> 
> An action might allow you to use a simpler action—usually one of the Basic Actions on page 469—in a different circumstance or with different effects. This subordinate action still has its normal traits and effects, but is modified in any ways listed in the larger action. For example, an activity that tells you to Stride up to half your Speed alters the normal distance you can move in a Stride. The Stride would still have the move trait, would still trigger reactions that occur based on movement, and so on. The subordinate action doesn't gain any of the traits of the larger action unless specified. The action that allows you to use a subordinate action doesn't require you to spend more actions or reactions to do so; that cost is already factored in.
> 
> Using an activity is not the same as using any of its subordinate actions. For example, the quickened condition you get from the [haste](compendium/spells/haste.md) spell lets you spend an extra action each turn to Stride or Strike, but you couldn't use the extra action for an activity that includes a Stride or Strike. As another example, if you used an action that specified, "If the next action you use is a Strike," an activity that includes a Strike wouldn't count, because the next thing you are doing is starting an activity, not using the Strike basic action.

### Actions with Triggers
<sup>CRB p. 462</sup>

You can use free actions that have triggers and reactions only in response to certain events. Each such reaction and free action lists the trigger that must happen for you to perform it. When its trigger is satisfied—and _only_ when it is satisfied—you can use the reaction or free action, though you don't have to use the action if you don't want to.

There are only a few basic reactions and free actions that all characters can use. You're more likely to gain actions with triggers from your class, feats, and magic items.

#### Limitations on Triggers
<sup>CRB p. 462</sup>

The triggers listed in the stat blocks of reactions and some free actions limit when you can use those actions. You can use only one action in response to a given trigger. For example, if you had a reaction and a free action that both had a trigger of "your turn begins," you could use either of them at the start of your turn—but not both. If two triggers are similar, but not identical, the GM determines whether you can use one action in response to each or whether they're effectively the same thing. Usually, this decision will be based on what's happening in the narrative.

This limitation of one action per trigger is per creature; more than one creature can use a reaction or free action in response to a given trigger.

### Other Actions
<sup>CRB p. 462</sup>

Sometimes you need to attempt something not already covered by defined actions in the game. When this happens, the rules tell you how many actions you need to spend, as well any traits your action might have. For example, a spell that lets you switch targets might say you can do so "by spending a single action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)." Game masters can also use this approach when a character tries to do something that isn't covered in the rules.

### Gaining and Losing Actions
<sup>CRB p. 462</sup>

Conditions can change the number of actions you can use on your turn, or whether you can use actions at all. The slowed condition, for example, causes you to lose actions, while the quickened condition causes you to gain them.

Conditions are detailed in the appendix on pages 618–623.

Whenever you lose a number of actions—whether from these conditions or in any other way—you choose which to lose if there's any difference between them. For instance, the [haste](compendium/spells/haste.md) spell makes you quickened, but it limits what you can use your extra action to do. If you lost an action while [haste](compendium/spells/haste.md) was active, you might want to lose the action from haste first, since it's more limited than your normal actions.

Some effects are even more restrictive. Certain abilities, instead of or in addition to changing the number of actions you can use, say specifically that you can't use reactions. The most restrictive form of reducing actions is when an effect states that you can't act: this means you can't use any actions, or even speak.

### Disrupting Actions
<sup>CRB p. 462</sup>

Various abilities and conditions, such as an Attack of Opportunity, can disrupt an action. When an action is disrupted, you still use the actions or reactions you committed and you still expend any costs, but the action's effects don't occur. In the case of an activity, you usually lose all actions spent for the activity up through the end of that turn. For instance, if you began a [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) activity requiring 3 actions and the first action was disrupted, you lose all 3 actions that you committed to that activity.

The GM decides what effects a disruption causes beyond simply negating the effects that would have occurred from the disrupted action. For instance, a Leap disrupted midway wouldn't transport you back to the start of your jump, and a disrupted item hand off might cause the item to fall to the ground instead of staying in the hand of the creature who was trying to give it away.

## Movement
<sup>CRB p. 463</sup>

Your movement and position determine how you can interact with the world. Moving around in exploration and downtime modes is relatively fluid and free form.

Movement in encounter mode, by contrast, is governed by rules explained in Movement in Encounters (page 473). The rules below apply regardless of which mode you're playing in.

### Movement Types
<sup>CRB p. 463</sup>

Creatures in Pathfinder soar through the clouds, scale sheer cliffs, and tunnel underfoot. Most creatures have a Speed, which is how fast they can move across the ground. Some abilities give you different ways to move, such as through the air or underground.

Each of these special movement types has its own Speed value. Many creatures have these Speeds naturally. The various types of movement are listed below. Since the Stride action can be used only with your normal Speed, moving using one of these movement types requires using a special action, and you can't Step while using one of these movement types. Since Speed by itself refers to your land Speed, rules text concerning these special movement types specifies the movement types to which it applies. Even though Speeds aren't checks, they can have item, circumstance, and status bonuses and penalties. These can't reduce your Speeds below 5 feet unless stated otherwise.

Switching from one movement type to another requires ending your action that has the first movement type and using a new action that has the second movement type. For instance, if you Climbed 10 feet to the top of a cliff, you could then Stride forward 10 feet.

#### Speed
<sup>CRB p. 463</sup>

Most characters and monsters have a speed statistic—also called land Speed—which indicates how quickly they can move across the ground. When you use the Stride action, you move a number of feet equal to your Speed. Numerous other abilities also allow you to move, from Crawling to Leaping, and most of them are based on your Speed in some way. Whenever a rule mentions your Speed without specifying a type, it's referring to your land Speed.

#### Burrow Speed
<sup>CRB p. 463</sup>

A burrow Speed lets you tunnel through the ground. You can use the [Burrow](rules/actions/burrow.md) action if you have a burrow Speed. Burrowing doesn't normally leave behind a tunnel unless the ability specifically states that it does. Most creatures need to hold their breath when burrowing, and they may need tremorsense (page 465) to navigate with any accuracy.

#### Climb Speed
<sup>CRB p. 463</sup>

A climb Speed allows you to move up or down inclines and vertical surfaces. Instead of needing to attempt [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to Climb, you automatically succeed and move up to your climb Speed instead of the listed distance.

You might still have to attempt [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to Climb in hazardous conditions, to Climb extremely difficult surfaces, or to cross horizontal planes such as ceilings. You can also choose to roll an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to Climb rather than accept an automatic success in hopes of getting a critical success. Your climb Speed grants you a +4 circumstance bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to Climb.

If you have a climb Speed, you're not [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) while climbing.

#### Fly Speed
<sup>CRB p. 463</sup>

As long as you have a fly Speed, you can use the [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md) and [Arrest a Fall](rules/actions/arrest-a-fall.md) actions. You can also attempt to [Maneuver in Flight](rules/actions/maneuver-in-flight.md) if you're trained in the [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) skill.

Wind conditions can affect how you use the [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md) action. In general, moving against the wind uses the same rules as moving through difficult terrain (or greater difficult terrain, if you're also flying upward), and moving with the wind allows you to move 10 feet for every 5 feet of movement you spend (not cumulative with moving straight downward). For more information on spending movement, see Movement in Encounters on page 473.

Upward and downward movement are both relative to the gravity in your area; if you're in a place with zero gravity, moving up or down is no different from moving horizontally.

#### Swim Speed
<sup>CRB p. 463</sup>

With a swim Speed, you can propel yourself through the water with little impediment. Instead of attempting [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md), you automatically succeed and move up to your swim Speed instead of the listed distance. Moving up or down is still moving through difficult terrain.

You might still have to attempt checks to [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) in hazardous conditions or to cross turbulent water. You can also choose to roll an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) rather than accept an automatic success in hopes of getting a critical success. Your swim Speed grants you a +4 circumstance bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md).

Having a swim Speed doesn't necessarily mean you can breathe in water, so you might still have to hold your breath if you're underwater to avoid drowning.

### Falling
<sup>CRB p. 463</sup>

When you fall more than 5 feet, you take bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance you fell when you land. Treat falls longer than 1,500 feet as though they were 1,500 feet (750 damage). If you take any damage from a fall, you land prone. You fall about 500 feet in the first round of falling and about 1,500 feet each round thereafter.

You can Grab an Edge as a reaction to reduce the damage from some falls. In addition, if you fall into water, snow, or another relatively soft substance, you can treat the fall as though it were 20 feet shorter, or 30 feet shorter if you intentionally dove in. The effective reduction can't be greater than the depth (so when falling into 10-foot-deep water, you treat the fall as 10 feet shorter).

#### Falling on a Creature
<sup>CRB p. 464</sup>

If you land on a creature, that creature must attempt a DC 15 Reflex save. Landing exactly on a creature after a long fall is almost impossible.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.
> - **Success** The creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to one-quarter the falling damage you took.
> - **Failure** The creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to half the falling damage you took.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes the same amount of bludgeoning damage you took from the fall.

#### Falling Objects
<sup>CRB p. 464</sup>

A dropped object takes damage just like a falling creature. If the object lands on a creature, that creature can attempt a Reflex save using the same rules as for a creature falling on a creature. Hazards and spells that involve falling objects, such as a rock slide, have their own rules about how they interact with creatures and the damage they deal.

## Perception
<sup>CRB p. 464</sup>

Your Perception measures your ability to notice things, search for what's hidden, and tell whether something about a situation is suspicious. This statistic is frequently used for rolling initiative to determine who goes first in an encounter, and it's also used for the [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) action.

The rules for rolling a Perception check are found on page 448. The rules below describe the effects of light and visibility on your specific senses to perceive the world, as well as the rules for sensing and locating creatures with Perception.

### Light
<sup>CRB p. 464</sup>

The amount of light in an area can affect how well you see things. There are three levels of light: bright light, dim light, and darkness. The rules in this book assume that all creatures are in bright light unless otherwise noted. A source of light lists the radius in which it sheds bright light, and it sheds dim light to double that radius.

#### Bright Light
<sup>CRB p. 464</sup>

In bright light, such as sunlight, creatures and objects can be observed clearly by anyone with average vision or better. Some types of creatures are [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) or [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by bright light.

#### Dim Light
<sup>CRB p. 464</sup>

Areas in shadow or lit by weak light sources are in dim light. Creatures and objects in dim light have the [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition, unless the seeker has [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md) or [low-light vision](rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md), or a 0 other than vision.

#### Darkness
<sup>CRB p. 464</sup>

A creature or object within darkness is hidden or undetected unless the seeker has [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md) or a 0 other than vision. A creature without [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md) or another means of perceiving in darkness has the [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) condition while in darkness, though it might be able to see illuminated areas beyond the darkness. If a creature can see into an illuminated area, it can observe creatures within that illuminated area normally. After being in darkness, sudden exposure to bright light might make you [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for a short time, as determined by the GM.

### Senses
<sup>CRB p. 464</sup>

The ways a creature can use [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) depend on what senses it has. The primary concepts you need to know for understanding senses are precise senses, imprecise senses, and the three states of detection a target can be in: observed, hidden, or undetected. Vision, hearing, and scent are three prominent senses, but they don't have the same degree of acuity.

#### Precise Senses
<sup>CRB p. 464</sup>

Average vision is a precise sense—a sense that can be used to perceive the world in nuanced detail. The only way to target a creature without having drawbacks is to use a precise sense. You can usually detect a creature automatically with a precise sense unless that creature is hiding or obscured by the environment, in which case you can use the Seek basic action to better detect the creature.

#### Imprecise Senses
<sup>CRB p. 464</sup>

Hearing is an imprecise sense—it cannot detect the full range of detail that a 0 can. You can usually sense a creature automatically with an imprecise sense, but it has the [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) condition instead of the [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed) condition. It might be [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by you if it's using [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) or is in an environment that distorts the sense, such as a noisy room in the case of hearing. In those cases, you have to use the [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) basic action to detect the creature. At best, an imprecise sense can be used to make an [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) creature (or one you didn't even know was there) merely [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden)—it can't make the creature [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed).

#### Vague Senses
<sup>CRB p. 465</sup>

A character also has many vague senses—ones that can alert you that something is there but aren't useful for zeroing in on it to determine exactly what it is. The most useful of these for a typical character is the sense of smell. At best, a vague sense can be used to detect the presence of an [unnoticed](rules/conditions.md#Unnoticed) creature, making it [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected). Even then, the vague sense isn't sufficient to make the creature [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) or [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed).

When one creature might detect another, the GM almost always uses the most 0 available.

Pathfinder's rules assume that a given creature has vision as its only 0 and hearing as its only 0. Some characters and creatures, however, have 0 or 0 that don't match this assumption. For instance, a character with poor vision might treat that sense as 0, an animal with the [scent](rules/abilities/scent.md) ability can use its sense of smell as an 0, and a creature with echolocation or a similar ability can use hearing as a 0 sense. Such senses are often given special names and appear as "echolocation (precise)," "scent (imprecise) 30 feet," or the like.

### Special Senses
<sup>CRB p. 465</sup>

While a human might have a difficult time making creatures out in dim light, an elf can see those creatures just fine. And though elves have no problem seeing on a moonlit night, their vision cannot penetrate complete darkness, whereas a dwarf's can.

Special senses grant greater awareness that allows a creature with these senses to either ignore or reduce the effects of the undetected, hidden, or concealed conditions (described in 0 below) when it comes to situations that foil average vision. The following are a few examples of common special senses.

#### Darkvision and Greater Darkvision
<sup>CRB p. 465</sup>

A creature with [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md) or [greater darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md) can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only. Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-level [darkness](compendium/spells/darkness.md) spell, block normal [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md). A creature with [greater darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md), however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness.

#### Low-Light Vision
<sup>CRB p. 465</sup>

A creature with [low-light vision](rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md) can see in dim light as though it were bright light, so it ignores the [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition due to dim light.

#### Scent
<sup>CRB p. 465</sup>

Scent involves sensing creatures or objects by smell, and is usually a vague sense. The range is listed in the ability, and it functions only if the creature or object being detected emits an aroma (for instance, incorporeal creatures usually do not exude an aroma).

If a creature emits a heavy aroma or is upwind, the GM can double or even triple the range of [scent](rules/abilities/scent.md) abilities used to detect that creature, and the GM can reduce the range if a creature is downwind.

#### Tremorsense
<sup>CRB p. 465</sup>

Tremorsense allows a creature to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is usually an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the detecting creature is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface.

> [!pf2-brown] DETECTING WITH OTHER SENSES
> 
> If a monster uses a sense other than vision, the GM can adapt the variables that keep its foes from being detected to equivalents that work with the monster's senses. For example, a creature that has echolocation might use hearing as a primary sense. This could mean its quarry is concealed in a noisy chamber, hidden in a great enough din, or even [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) in the area of a [silence](compendium/spells/silence.md) spell.
> 
> ### Using Stealth with Other Senses
> <sup>CRB p. 465</sup>
> 
> The [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) skill is designed to use Hide for avoiding visual detection and Avoid Notice and Sneak to avoid being both seen and heard. For many special senses, a player can describe how they're avoiding detection by that special sense and use the most applicable [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) action. For instance, a creature stepping lightly to avoid being detected via tremorsense would be using Sneak.
> 
> In some cases, rolling a Dexterity-based [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) skill check to Sneak doesn't make the most sense. For example, when facing a creature that can detect heartbeats, a PC trying to avoid being detected might meditate to slow their heart rate, using Wisdom instead of Dexterity as the ability modifier for the [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check. When a creature that can detect you has multiple senses, such as if it could also hear or see, the PC would use the lowest applicable ability modifier for the check.

### Detecting Creatures
<sup>CRB p. 465</sup>

There are three conditions that measure the degree to which you can sense a creature: observed, hidden, and undetected. However, the concealed and invisible conditions can partially mask a creature, and the unnoticed condition indicates you have no idea a creature is around. In addition to the descriptions here, you can find these conditions in the Conditions page.

With the exception of [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), these conditions are relative to the viewer—it's possible for a creature to be observed to you but hidden from your ally. When you're trying to target a creature that's hard to see or otherwise sense, various drawbacks apply. Most of these rules apply to objects you're trying to detect as well as creatures.

Typically, the GM tracks how well creatures detect each other, since neither party has perfect information. For example, you might think a creature is in the last place you sensed it, but it was able to Sneak away. Or you might think a creature can't see you in the dark, but it has [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md).

You can attempt to avoid detection by using the [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) skill to [Avoid Notice](rules/actions/avoid-notice.md), [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md), or [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md), or by using [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) to [Create a Diversion](rules/actions/create-a-diversion.md).

#### Observed
<sup>CRB p. 466</sup>

In most circumstances, you can sense creatures without difficulty and target them normally. Creatures in this state are observed. Observing requires a precise sense, which for most creatures means sight, but see the Detecting with Other Senses sidebar for advice regarding creatures that don't use sight as their primary sense. If you can't observe the creature, it's either [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden), [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected), or [unnoticed](rules/conditions.md#Unnoticed), and you'll need to factor in the targeting restrictions. Even if a creature is [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed), it might still be [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed).

#### Hidden
<sup>CRB p. 466</sup>

A creature that's hidden is only barely perceptible. You know what space a hidden creature occupies, but little else. Perhaps the creature just moved behind cover and successfully used the Hide action. Your target might be in a deep fogbank or behind a waterfall, where you can see some movement but can't determine an exact location. Maybe you've been [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) or the creature is under the effects of [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md), but you used the [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) basic action to determine its general location based on hearing alone. Regardless of the specifics, you're [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to a hidden creature.

When targeting a [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) creature, before you roll to determine your effect, you must attempt a DC 11 flat check. If you fail, you don't affect the creature, though the actions you used are still expended—as well as any spell slots, costs, and other resources. You remain [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to the creature, whether you successfully target it or not.

#### Undetected
<sup>CRB p. 466</sup>

If a creature is undetected, you don't know what space it occupies, you're [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to it, and you can't easily target it. Using the [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) basic action can help you find an undetected creature, usually making it [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from you instead of [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected). If a creature is [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected), that doesn't necessarily mean you're unaware of its presence—you might suspect an [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) creature is in the room with you, even though you're unable to find its space. The [unnoticed](rules/conditions.md#Unnoticed) condition covers creatures you're entirely unaware of.

Targeting an [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) creature is difficult. If you suspect there's a creature around, you can pick a square and attempt an attack. This works like targeting a [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) creature, but the flat check and attack roll are both rolled in secret by the GM. The GM won't tell you why you missed—whether it was due to failing the flat check, rolling an insufficient attack roll, or choosing the wrong square. The GM might allow you to try targeting an undetected creature with some spells or other abilities in a similar fashion. [Undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) creatures are subject to area effects normally.

For instance, suppose an enemy elf wizard cast [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md) and then [Sneaked](rules/actions/sneak.md) away. You suspect that with the elf's Speed of 30 feet, they probably moved 15 feet toward an open door. You move up and attack a space 15 feet from where the elf started and directly on the path to the door. The GM secretly rolls an attack roll and flat check, but they know that you were not quite correct—the elf was actually in the adjacent space! The GM tells you that you missed, so you decide to make your next attack on the adjacent space, just in case. This time, it's the right space, and the GM's secret attack roll and flat check both succeed, so you hit!

#### Unnoticed
<sup>CRB p. 467</sup>

If you have no idea a creature is even present, that creature is unnoticed by you. A creature that is undetected might also be unnoticed. This condition usually matters for abilities that can be used only against targets totally unaware of your presence.

## Concealment and Invisibility
<sup>CRB p. 467</sup>

The concealed and invisible conditions reflect certain circumstances that can make a creature harder to see.

### Concealed
<sup>CRB p. 467</sup>

This condition protects a creature if it's in mist, within dim light, or amid something else that obscures sight but does not provide a physical barrier to effects. An effect or type of terrain that describes an area of concealment makes all creatures within it concealed.

When you target a creature that's [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) from you, you must attempt a DC 5 flat check before you roll to determine your effect. If you fail, you don't affect the target. the [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition doesn't change which of the main categories of detection apply to the creature. A creature in a light fog bank is still observed even though it's concealed.

### Invisible
<sup>CRB p. 467</sup>

A creature with the invisible condition (by way of an [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md) spell or [invisibility potion](compendium/equipment/items/invisibility-potion.md), for example) is automatically [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) to any creatures relying on sight as their only precise sense. Precise senses other than sight ignore the invisible condition.

You can use the [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) basic action to attempt to figure out an [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creature's location, making it instead only [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from you. This lasts until the [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creature successfully uses [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md) to become [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) again. If you're already [observing](rules/conditions.md#Observed) a creature when it becomes [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), it starts out [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden), since you know where it was when it became [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible), though it can then [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md) to become [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected).

Other effects might make an [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creature hidden or even observed but concealed. For instance, if you were tracking an invisible creature's footprints through the snow, the footprints would make it hidden.

Similarly, throwing a net over an [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creature would make it [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed) but [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) for as long as the net is on the creature.

## Hero Points
<sup>CRB p. 467</sup>

Your heroic deeds earn you Hero Points, which grant you good fortune or let you recover from the brink of death. Unlike most aspects of your character, which persist over the long term, Hero Points last for only a single session.

The GM is in charge of awarding Hero Points (guidelines for doing so can be found 1).

Usually, each character gets 1 Hero Point at the start of a session and can gain more later by performing heroic deeds—something selfless, daring, or beyond normal expectations. You can have a maximum of 3 Hero Points at a time, and you lose any remaining Hero Points at the end of a session.

You can spend your Hero Points in one of two ways.

Neither of these is an action, and you can spend Hero Points even if you aren't able to act. You can spend a Hero Point on behalf of your familiar or animal companion.

- **Spend 1 Hero Point** to reroll a check. You must use the second result. This is a fortune effect (which means you can't use more than 1 Hero Point on a check).
- **Spend all your Hero Points** (minimum 1) to avoid death. You can do this when your [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition would increase. You lose the [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition entirely and stabilize with 0 Hit Points. You don't gain the [wounded](rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition or increase its value from losing the [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition in this way, but if you already had that condition, you don't lose it or decrease its value.

### Describing Heroic Deeds
<sup>CRB p. 467</sup>

Because spending Hero Points reflects heroic deeds or tasks that surpass normal expectations, if you spend a Hero Point, you should describe the deed or task your character accomplishes with it to the other players.

Your character's deed might invoke a lesson learned in a past adventure, could be spurred by a determination to save someone else, or might depend on an item that ended up on their person due to a previous exploit. If you don't want to describe the deed or don't have any strong ideas about how to do so, ask the GM to come up with something for you. This can be a collaborative process, too. The GM might remind you of a long-forgotten event in the campaign, and all you have to do is fill in how that event comes to mind just at the right time, motivating you to push past your limits.

## Encounter Mode
<sup>CRB p. 468</sup>

### Structure
<sup>CRB p. 468</sup>

An encounter is played out in a series of rounds, during which the player characters, adversaries, and other participants in the encounter act in sequence.

You roll initiative to determine this order at the start of the encounter and then play through rounds until a conclusion is reached and the encounter ends. The rules in this section assume a combat encounter—a battle—but the general structure can apply to any kind of encounter.

#### Step 1: Roll Initiative
<sup>CRB p. 468</sup>

When the GM calls for it, you'll roll initiative to determine your place in the initiative order, which is the sequence in which the encounter's participants will take their turns. Rolling initiative marks the start of an encounter. More often than not, you'll roll initiative when you enter a battle.

Typically, you'll roll a Perception check to determine your initiative—the more aware you are of your surroundings, the more quickly you can respond. Sometimes, though, the GM might call on you to roll some other type of check. For instance, if you were Avoiding Notice during exploration (page 479), you'd roll a [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check. A social encounter could call for a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check.

The GM rolls initiative for anyone other than the player characters in the encounter. If these include a number of identical creatures, the GM could roll once for the group as a whole and have them take their turns within the group in any order. However, this can make battles less predictable and more dangerous, so the GM might want to roll initiative for some or all creatures individually unless it's too much of a burden.

Unlike a typical check, where the result is compared to a DC, the results of initiative rolls are ranked. This ranking sets the order in which the encounter's participants act—the initiative order. The character with the highest result goes first. The second highest follows, and so on until whoever had the lowest result takes their turn last.

If your result is tied with a foe's result, the adversary goes first. If your result is tied with another PC's, you can decide between yourselves who goes first when you reach that place in the initiative order. After that, your places in the initiative order usually don't change during the encounter.

#### Step 2: Play a Round
<sup>CRB p. 468</sup>

A round begins when the participant with the highest initiative roll result starts their turn, and it ends when the one with the lowest initiative ends their turn. The process of taking a turn is detailed below. Creatures might also act outside their turns with reactions and free actions.

#### Step 3: Begin the Next Round
<sup>CRB p. 468</sup>

Once everyone in the encounter has taken a turn, the round is over and the next one begins. Don't roll initiative again; the new round proceeds in the same order as the previous one, repeating the cycle until the encounter ends.

#### Step 4: End the Encounter
<sup>CRB p. 468</sup>

When your foes are defeated, some sort of truce is reached, or some other event or circumstance ends the combat, the encounter is over. You and the other participants no longer follow the initiative order, and a more free-form style of play resumes, with the game typically moving into exploration mode. Sometimes at the end of an encounter, the GM will award Experience Points to the party or you'll find treasure to divvy up.

### Turns
<sup>CRB p. 468</sup>

When it's your turn to act, you can use single actions ([>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")), short activities ([>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") and [>>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action")), reactions ([reaction]), and free actions ([F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action")). When you're finished, your turn ends and the character next in the initiative order begins their turn.

Sometimes it's important to note when during your turn something happens, so a turn is divided into three steps.

#### Step 1: Start Your Turn
<sup>CRB p. 468</sup>

Many things happen automatically at the start of your turn—it's a common point for tracking the passage of time for effects that last multiple rounds. At the start of each of your turns, take these steps in any order you choose:

- If you created an effect lasting for a certain number of rounds, reduce the number of rounds remaining by 1. The effect ends if the duration is reduced to 0. For example, if you cast a spell that lasts 3 rounds on yourself during your first turn of a fight, it would affect you during that turn, decrease to 2 rounds of duration at the start of your second turn, decrease to 1 round of duration at the start of your third turn, and expire at the start of your fourth turn.
- You can use 1 free action or reaction with a trigger of "Your turn begins" or something similar.
- If you're [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying), roll a recovery check (page 459).
- Do anything else that is specified to happen at the start of your turn.

The last step of starting your turn is always the same.

- Regain your 3 actions and 1 reaction. If you haven't spent your reaction from your last turn, you lose it—you can't "save" actions or reactions from one turn to use during the next turn. If a condition prevents you from being able to act, you don't regain any actions or your reaction. Some abilities or conditions (such as [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) and [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed)) can change how many actions you regain and whether you regain your reaction. If you lose actions and gain additional actions (such as if you're both [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) and [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed)), you choose which actions to lose.

#### Step 2: Act
<sup>CRB p. 469</sup>

You can use actions in any order you wish during your turn, but you have to complete one action or activity before beginning another; for example, you can't use a single action in the middle of performing a 2-action activity. What actions you can use often depend on your class features, skills, feats, and items, but there are default actions anyone can use, described in Basic Actions below. Some effects might prevent you from acting. If you can't act, you can't use any actions, including reactions and free actions.

If you begin a 2-action or 3-action activity on your turn, you must be able to complete it on your turn. You can't, for example, begin to High Jump using your final action on one turn and then complete it as your first action on your next turn.

Once you have spent all 3 of your actions, your turn ends (as described in Step 3) and the next creature's turn begins. You can, however, use only some of your actions and end your turn early. As soon as your turn ends, you lose all your remaining actions, but not your reaction or your ability to use free actions.

#### Step 3: End Your Turn
<sup>CRB p. 469</sup>

Once you've done all the things you want to do with the actions you have available, you reach the end of your turn.

Take the following steps in any order you choose. Play then proceeds to the next creature in the initiative order.

- End any effects that last until the end of your turn. For example, spells with a sustained duration end at the end of your turn unless you used the [Sustain a Spell](rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) action during your turn to extend them. Some effects caused by enemies might also last through a certain number of your turns, and you decrease the remaining duration by 1 during this step, ending the effect if its duration is reduced to 0.
- If you have a [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) condition, you take the damage at this point. After you take the damage, you can attempt the flat check to end the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). You then attempt any saving throws for ongoing afflictions. Many other conditions change at the end of your turn, such as the [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition decreasing in severity. These take place after you've taken any [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), attempted flat checks to end the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and attempted saves against any afflictions.
- You can use 1 free action or reaction with a trigger of "Your turn ends" or something similar.
- Resolve anything else specified to happen at the end of your turn.

> 
> The GM keeps track of the initiative order for an encounter.
> 
> It's usually okay for the players to know this order, since they'll see who goes when and be aware of one another's results. However, the GM might want to conceal the names of adversaries the PCs have yet to identify.
> 
> Once the encounter's order is set, it's usually not necessary to track the original initiative numbers. The GM can create a simple list, use a series of cards or other indicators, or use a _Pathfinder Combat Pad_, which has magnetic markers to allow for easily rearranging the order.
> 
> ### Changing the Initiative Order
> <sup>CRB p. 469</sup>
> 
> Any method used to track the initiative order needs to be flexible because the order can change. A creature can use the Delay basic action to change its place in the order, in which case you can erase it from the list or pull its marker aside until it reenters the initiative order. When a creature gets knocked out, its initiative order also changes (see Knocked Out and Dying on page 459). Using the Ready basic action doesn't change a creature's place in the initiative order, though, because the designated action becomes a reaction.

### Basic Actions
<sup>CRB p. 469</sup>

Basic actions represent common tasks like moving around, attacking, and helping others. As such, every creature can use basic actions except in some extreme circumstances, and many of those actions are used very frequently. Most notably, you'll use Interact, Step, Stride, and Strike a great deal. Many feats and other actions call upon you to use one of these basic actions or modify them to produce different effects. For example, a more complex action might let you Stride up to double your Speed instead of just up to your Speed, and a large number of activities include a Strike.

Actions that are used less frequently but are still available to most creatures are presented in Specialty Basic Actions starting on page 472. These typically have requirements that not all characters are likely to meet, such as wielding a shield or having a burrow Speed.

In addition to the actions in these two sections, the actions for spellcasting can be found on pages 302–305, and the actions for using magic items appear on pages 531–534.

> [!pf2-note]
> To view all actions, please visit the Actions page.

> [!pf2-brown] SPEAKING
> 
> As long as you can act, you can also speak. You don't need to spend any type of action to speak, but because a round represents 6 seconds of time, you can usually speak at most a single sentence or so per round. Special uses of speech, such as attempting a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) skill check to Lie, require spending actions and follow their own rules.
> 
> All speech has the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md) trait. If you communicate in some way other than speech, other rules might apply. For instance, using sign language is [visual](rules/traits/visual.md) instead of [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md).

#### Specialty Basic Actions
<sup>CRB p. 472</sup>

These actions are useful under specific circumstances. Some require you to have a special movement type (page 463).

### Activities in Encounters
<sup>CRB p. 472</sup>

Activities that take longer than a turn can't normally be performed during an encounter. Spells with a casting time of 1 minute or more are a common example of this, as are several skill actions. When you commit to an activity during your turn in an encounter, you commit to spending all of the actions it requires. If the activity gets interrupted partway through, you lose all of the actions you would have spent on that activity. Activities are described in full on page 461.

### Reactions in Encounters
<sup>CRB p. 472</sup>

Your reactions let you respond immediately to what's happening around you. The GM determines whether you can use reactions before your first turn begins, depending on the situation in which the encounter happens.

Once your first turn begins, you gain your actions and reaction. You can use 1 reaction per round. You can use a reaction on anyone's turn (including your own), but only when its trigger occurs. If you don't use your reaction, you lose it at the start of your next turn, though you typically then gain a reaction at the start of that turn.

Some reactions are specifically meant to be used in combat and can change how the battle plays out drastically.

One example of such a reaction is [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md), which fighters gain at 1st level.

This reaction lets you make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) if a creature within reach uses a [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md) or [move](rules/traits/move.md) action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a [move](rules/traits/move.md) action. The Triggering Moves diagram on page 474 illustrates examples of movements that might trigger an [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md) from a creature without reach and one with reach.

You'll notice this reaction allows you to use a modified basic action, a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). This follows the rules on subordinate actions found on page 462.

Because your [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md) takes place outside of your turn, the attack roll doesn't incur a multiple attack penalty.

### Movement in Encounters
<sup>CRB p. 473</sup>

Your movement during encounter mode depends on the actions and other abilities you use. Whether you Stride, Step, Swim, or Climb, the maximum distance you can move is based on your Speed. Certain feats or magic items can grant you other movement types, allowing you to swiftly burrow, climb, fly, or swim (page 463).

When the rules refer to a "movement cost" or "spending movement," they are describing how many feet of your Speed you must use to move from one point to another. Normally, movement costs 5 feet per square when you're moving on a grid, or it costs the number of feet you move if you're not using a grid. However, sometimes it's harder to move a certain distance due to difficult terrain or other factors. In such a case, you might have to spend a different amount of movement to move from one place to another.

For example, a form of movement might require 10 feet of movement to move 1 square, and moving through some types of terrain costs an extra 5 feet of movement per square.

#### Grid Movement
<sup>CRB p. 473</sup>

If an encounter involves combat, it's often a good idea to track the movement and relative position of the participants using a Pathfinder Flip-Mat, Flip-Tiles, or some other form of grid to display the terrain, and miniatures to represent the combatants. When a character moves on a grid, every 1-inch square of the play area is 5 feet across in the game world. Hence, a creature moving in a straight line spends 5 feet of its movement for every map square traveled.

Because moving diagonally covers more ground, you count that movement differently. The first square of diagonal movement you make in a turn counts as 5 feet, but the second counts as 10 feet, and your count thereafter alternates between the two. For example, as you move across 4 squares diagonally, you would count 5 feet, then 10, then 5, and then 10, for a total of 30 feet. You track your total diagonal movement across all your movement during your turn, but reset your count at the end of your turn.

#### Size, Space, and Reach
<sup>CRB p. 473</sup>

Creatures and objects of different sizes occupy different amounts of space. The sizes and the spaces they each take up on a grid are listed in [Table 9–1: Size and Reach](rules/tables/size-and-reach.md).

Table 9–1 also lists the typical reach for creatures of each size, for both tall creatures (most bipeds) and long creatures (most quadrupeds). See page 455 for more about reach.

The Space entry lists how many feet on a side a creature's space is, so a Large creature fills a 10-foot-by-10-foot space (4 squares on the grid). Sometimes part of a creature extends beyond its space, such as if a giant octopus is grabbing you with its tentacles. In that case, the GM will usually allow attacking the extended portion, even if you can't reach the main creature. A Small or larger creature or object takes up at least 1 square on a grid, and creatures of these sizes can't usually share spaces except in situations like a character riding a mount. Rules for moving through other creatures' spaces appear below.

![Size and Reach](rules/tables/size-and-reach.md)

Multiple Tiny creatures can occupy the same square. At least four can fit in a single square, though the GM might determine that even more can fit. Tiny creatures can occupy a space occupied by a larger creature as well, and if their reach is 0 feet, they must do so in order to attack.

#### Move Actions That Trigger Reactions
<sup>CRB p. 474</sup>

Some reactions and free actions are triggered by a creature using an action with the move trait. The most notable example is Attack of Opportunity. Actions with the move trait can trigger reactions or free actions throughout the course of the distance traveled. Each time you exit a square (or move 5 feet if not using a grid) within a creature's reach, your movement triggers those reactions and free actions (although no more than once per move action for a given reacting creature). If you use a move action but don't move out of a square, the trigger instead happens at the end of that action or ability.

Some actions, such as Step, specifically state they don't trigger reactions or free actions based on movement.

#### Moving Through a Creature's Space
<sup>CRB p. 474</sup>

You can move through the space of a willing creature. If you want to move through an unwilling creature's space, you can [Tumble Through](rules/actions/tumble-through.md) that creature's space using [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics). You can't end your turn in a square occupied by another creature, though you can end a move action in its square provided that you immediately use another move action to leave that square. If two creatures end up in the same square by accident, the GM determines which one is forced out of the square (or whether one falls prone).

##### Prone and Incapacitated Creatures
<sup>CRB p. 474</sup>

You can share a space with a prone creature if that creature is willing, unconscious, or dead and if it is your size or smaller. The GM might allow you to climb atop the corpse or unconscious body of a larger creature in some situations. A prone creature can't stand up while someone else occupies its space, but it can Crawl to a space where it's able to stand, or it can attempt to Shove the other creature out of the way.

##### Creatures of Different Sizes
<sup>CRB p. 475</sup>

In most cases, you can move through the space of a creature at least three sizes larger than you (Table 9-1). This means a Medium creature can move through the space of a Gargantuan creature and a Small creature can move through the space of a Huge creature. Likewise, a bigger creature can move through the space of a creature three sizes smaller than itself or smaller. You still can't end your movement in a space occupied by a creature.

Tiny creatures are an exception. They can move through creatures' spaces and can even end their movement there.

##### Objects
<sup>CRB p. 475</sup>

Because objects aren't as mobile as creatures are, they're more likely to fill a space. This means you can't always move through their spaces like you might move through a space occupied by a creature. You might be able to occupy the same square as a statue of your size, but not a wide column. The GM determines whether you can move into an object's square normally, whether special rules apply, or if you are unable to move into the square at all.

### Forced Movement
<sup>CRB p. 475</sup>

When an effect forces you to move, or if you start falling, the distance you move is defined by the effect that moved you, not by your Speed. Because you're not acting to move, this doesn't trigger reactions that are triggered by movement.

If forced movement would move you into a space you can't occupy—because objects are in the way or because you lack the movement type needed to reach it, for example—you stop moving in the last space you can occupy. Usually the creature or effect forcing the movement chooses the path the victim takes. If you're pushed or pulled, you can usually be moved through hazardous terrain, pushed off a ledge, or the like. Abilities that reposition you in some other way can't put you in such dangerous places unless they specify otherwise. In all cases, the GM makes the final call if there's doubt on where forced movement can move a creature.

### Terrain
<sup>CRB p. 475</sup>

Several types of terrain can complicate your movement by slowing you down, damaging you, or endangering you.

#### Difficult Terrain
<sup>CRB p. 475</sup>

Difficult terrain is any terrain that impedes your movement, ranging from particularly rough or unstable surfaces to thick ground cover and countless other impediments. Moving into a square of **difficult terrain** (or moving 5 feet into or within an area of difficult terrain, if you're not using a grid) costs an extra 5 feet of movement.

Moving into a square of **greater difficult terrain** instead costs 10 additional feet of movement. This additional cost is not increased when moving diagonally. You can't Step into difficult terrain.

Movement you make while you are jumping ignores the terrain you're jumping over. Some abilities (such as flight or being incorporeal) allow you to avoid the movement reduction from some types of difficult terrain. Certain other abilities let you ignore difficult terrain on foot; such an ability also allows you to move through greater difficult terrain at the normal movement cost as for difficult terrain, though it wouldn't let you ignore greater difficult terrain unless the ability specifies otherwise.

#### Hazardous Terrain
<sup>CRB p. 476</sup>

Hazardous terrain damages you whenever you move through it. An acid pool and a pit of burning embers are both examples of hazardous terrain. The amount and type of damage depend on the specific hazardous terrain.

#### Narrow Surfaces
<sup>CRB p. 476</sup>

A narrow surface is so precariously thin that you need to [Balance](rules/actions/balance.md) or risk falling. Even on a success, you are [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) on a narrow surface.

Each time you are hit by an attack or fail a save on a narrow surface, you must succeed at a Reflex save (with the same DC as the [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Balance](rules/actions/balance.md)) or fall.

#### Uneven Ground
<sup>CRB p. 476</sup>

Uneven ground is an area unsteady enough that you need to [Balance](rules/actions/balance.md) or risk falling prone and possibly injuring yourself, depending on the specifics of the uneven ground. You are [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) on uneven ground. Each time you are hit by an attack or fail a save on uneven ground, you must succeed at a Reflex save (with the same DC as the [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check to Balance) or fall prone.

#### Inclines
<sup>CRB p. 476</sup>

An incline is an area so steep that you need to [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md) using the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill in order to progress upward.

You're [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) when [Climbing](rules/actions/climb.md) an incline.

### Flanking
<sup>CRB p. 476</sup>

When you and an ally are flanking a foe, it has a harder time defending against you. A creature is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) (taking a –2 circumstance penalty to AC) to melee attacks from creatures that are flanking it.

To flank a foe, you and your ally must be on opposites sides or corners of the creature. A line drawn between the center of your space and the center of your ally's space must pass through opposite sides or opposite corners of the foe's space. Additionally, both you and the ally have to be able to act, must be wielding melee weapons or able to make an unarmed attack, can't be under any effects that prevent you from attacking, and must have the enemy within reach. If you are wielding a reach weapon, you use your [reach](rules/traits/reach.md) with that weapon for this purpose.

### Cover
<sup>CRB p. 477</sup>

When you're behind an obstacle that could block weapons, guard you against explosions, and make you harder to detect, you're behind cover. Standard cover gives you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, to Reflex saves against area effects, and to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md), [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md), or otherwise avoid detection. You can increase this to greater cover using the [Take Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md) basic action, increasing the circumstance bonus to +4. If cover is especially light, typically when it's provided by a creature, you have lesser cover, which grants a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. A creature with standard cover or greater cover can attempt to use [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md), but lesser cover isn't sufficient.

| Type of Cover | Bonus | Can Hide |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| Lesser | +1 to AC | No |
| Standard | +2 to AC, Reflex, [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) | Yes |
| Greater | +4 to AC, Reflex, [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) | Yes |

Cover is relative, so you might simultaneously have cover against one creature and not another. Cover applies only if your path to the target is partially blocked. If a creature is entirely behind a wall or the like, you don't have line of effect and typically can't target it at all.

Usually, the GM can quickly decide whether your target has cover. If you're uncertain or need to be more precise, draw a line from the center of your space to the center of the target's space. If that line passes through any terrain or object that would block the effect, the target has standard cover (or greater cover if the obstruction is extreme or the target has [Taken Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md)). If the line passes through a creature instead, the target has lesser cover. When measuring cover against an area effect, draw the line from the effect's point of origin to the center of the creature's space.

#### Cover and Large Creatures
<sup>CRB p. 477</sup>

If a creature between you and a target is two or more sizes larger than both you and your target, that creature's space blocks the effect enough to provide standard cover instead of lesser cover. The GM might determine that a creature doesn't gain cover from terrain that it's significantly larger than. For example, a Huge dragon probably wouldn't receive any benefit from being behind a 1-foot-wide pillar.

#### Special Circumstances
<sup>CRB p. 477</sup>

Your GM might allow you to overcome your target's cover in some situations. If you're right next to an arrow slit, you can shoot without penalty, but you have greater cover against someone shooting back at you from far away. Your GM might let you reduce or negate cover by leaning around a corner to shoot or the like. This usually takes an action to set up, and the GM might measure cover from an edge or corner of your space instead of your center.

### Special Battles
<sup>CRB p. 477</sup>

Sometimes fights occur while the characters are atop mounts or when the PCs take to the sky or seas.

#### Mounted Combat
<sup>CRB p. 478</sup>

You can ride some creatures into combat. As noted in the [Mount](rules/actions/mount.md) specialty basic action, your mount needs to be at least one size larger than you and willing. Your mount acts on your initiative. You must use the [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) action (page 249) to get your mount to spend its actions. If you don't, the animal wastes its actions. If you have the Ride general feat, you succeed automatically when you [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) that's your mount.

For example, if you are mounted on a horse and you make three attacks, your horse would remain stationary since you didn't command it. If you instead spent your first action to [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) and succeeded, you could get your mount to Stride. You could spend your next action to attack or to command the horse to attack, but not both.

##### Mounted Attacks
<sup>CRB p. 478</sup>

You and your mount fight as a unit. Consequently, you share a multiple attack penalty. For example, if you Strike and then [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) to have your mount Strike, your mount's attack takes a –5 multiple attack penalty.

You occupy every square of your mount's space for the purpose of making your attacks. If you were Medium and on a Large mount, you could attack a creature on one side of your mount, then attack on the opposite side with your next action. If you have a longer reach, the distance depends partly on the size of your mount. On a Medium or smaller mount, use your normal reach. On a Large or Huge mount, you can attack any square adjacent to the mount if you have 5- or 10-foot reach, or any square within 10 feet of the mount (including diagonally) if you have 15-foot reach.

##### Mounted Defenses
<sup>CRB p. 478</sup>

When you're mounted, attackers can target either you or your mount. Anything that affects multiple creatures (such as an area) affects both of you as long as you're both in the area. You are in an attacker's reach or range if any square of your mount is within reach or range. Because your mount is larger than you and you share its space, you have lesser cover against attacks targeting you when you're mounted if the mount would be in the way.

Because you can't move your body as freely while you're riding a mount, you take a –2 circumstance penalty to Reflex saves while mounted. Additionally, the only move action you can use is the Mount action to dismount.

> [!pf2-brown] THREE-DIMENSIONAL COMBAT
> 
> In aerial and aquatic combat, you might need to track positioning in three dimensions. For flying creatures, you might use one of the following methods:
> 
> - Find platforms to place flying creatures' miniatures on.
> - Set a die next to a creature with the number indicating how many squares up in the air it is.
> - Make a stack of dice or tokens, 1 per 5 feet of elevation.
> - Write the elevation next to the monster on the grid. In underwater combat, choose a plane to be the baseline, typically the waterline, the sea floor, or a stationary object you can measure from.
> 
> As with ground-based movement, moving diagonally up or down in 3-D space requires counting every other diagonal as 10 feet. Measure flanking in all directions—creatures above and below an enemy can flank it just as effectively as they can from opposite sides.

#### Aerial Combat
<sup>CRB p. 478</sup>

Many monsters can fly, and PCs can use spells and items to gain the ability to fly. Flying creatures have to use the Fly action (page 472) to move through the air. Performing an especially tricky maneuver—such as trying to reverse course 180 degrees or fly through a narrow gap—might require using [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) to Maneuver in Flight. Creatures might fall from the sky, using the falling rules found on page 463. At the GM's discretion, some ground-based actions might not work in the air. For instance, a flying creature couldn't Leap.

#### Aquatic Combat
<sup>CRB p. 478</sup>

Use these rules for battles in water or underwater:

- You're [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) unless you have a swim Speed.
- You gain resistance 5 to acid and fire.
- You take a –2 circumstance penalty to melee slashing or bludgeoning attacks that pass through water.
- Ranged attacks that deal bludgeoning or slashing damage automatically miss if the attacker or target is underwater, and piercing ranged attacks made by an underwater creature or against an underwater target have their range increments halved.
- You can't cast fire spells or use actions with the fire trait underwater.
- At the GM's discretion, some ground-based actions might not work underwater or while floating.

##### Drowning and Suffocating
<sup>CRB p. 478</sup>

You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier. Reduce your remaining air by 1 round at the end of each of your turns, or by 2 if you attacked or cast any spells that turn. You also lose 1 round worth of air each time you are critically hit or critically fail a save against a damaging effect. If you speak (including casting spells with verbal components or activating items with command components) you lose all remaining air.

When you run out of air, you fall [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and start suffocating. You can't recover from being unconscious and must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save at the end of each of your turns. On a failure, you take 1d10 damage, and on a critical failure, you die. On each check after the first, the DC increases by 5 and the damage by 1d10; these increases are cumulative. Once your access to air is restored, you stop suffocating and are no longer unconscious (unless you're at 0 Hit Points).

## Exploration Mode
<sup>CRB p. 479</sup>

Much of exploration mode involves movement and roleplaying. You might be traveling from one town to another, chatting with a couple of merchants an outpost along the way, or maybe having a terse conversation with the watchful city guards at your destination. Instead of measuring your rate of movement in 5-foot squares every round, you measure it in feet or miles per minute, hour, or day, using your travel speed. Rather than deciding on each action every turn, you'll engage in an exploration activity, and you'll typically spend some time every day resting and making your daily preparations.

### Travel Speed
<sup>CRB p. 479</sup>

Depending on how the GM tracks movement, you move in feet or miles based on your character's Speed with the relevant movement type. Typical rates are on the table below.

![Travel Speed](rules/tables/travel-speed.md)

The rates in Table 9 –2 assume traveling over flat and clear terrain at a determined pace, but one that's not exhausting.

Moving through difficult terrain halves the listed movement rate. greater difficult terrain reduces the distance traveled to one-third the listed amount. If the travel requires a skill check to accomplish, such as mountain climbing or swimming, the GM might call for a check once per hour using the result and the table above to determine your progress.

### Exploration Activities
<sup>CRB p. 479</sup>

While you're traveling and exploring, tell the GM what you'd generally like to do along the way. If you to do nothing more than make steady progress toward your goal, you move at the full travel speeds given in Table 9 –2.

When you want to do something other than simply travel, you describe what you are attempting to do. It isn't necessary to go into extreme detail, such as "Using my dagger, I nudge the door so I can check for devious traps." Instead, "I'm searching the area for hazards" is sufficient. The GM finds the best exploration activity to match your description and describes the effects of that activity. Some exploration activities limit how fast you can travel and be effective.

These are most common exploration activities.

### Rest and Daily Preparations
<sup>CRB p. 480</sup>

You perform at your best when you take enough time to rest and prepare. Once every 24 hours, you can take a period of rest (typically 8 hours), after which you regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) times your level, and you might recover from or improve certain conditions (page 453). Sleeping in armor results in poor rest that leaves you [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued). If you go more than 16 hours without resting, you become [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) (you cannot recover from this until you rest at least 6 continuous hours).

After you rest, you make your daily preparations, which takes around 1 hour. You can prepare only if you've rested, and only once per day. Preparing includes the following:

- Spellcasters regain spell slots, and prepared spellcasters choose spells to have available that day.
- Focus Points, other abilities that refresh during your preparations, and abilities that can be used only a certain number of times per day, including magic item uses, are reset.
- You don armor and equip weapons and other gear.
- You invest up to 10 worn magic items to gain their benefits for the day.

## Downtime Mode
<sup>CRB p. 481</sup>

Downtime gives you time to rest fully, engage in crafting or a professional endeavor, learn new spells, retrain feats, or just have fun. You can sell items acquired during your adventures, buy new goods, and perform other activities as determined by your feats, your skills, and the settlement where you are spending the downtime.

### Long-Term Rest
<sup>CRB p. 481</sup>

You can spend an entire day and night resting during downtime to recover Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) multiplied by twice your level.

### Retraining
<sup>CRB p. 481</sup>

Retraining offers a way to alter some of your character choices, which is helpful when you want to take your character in a new direction or change decisions that didn't meet your expectations. You can retrain feats, skills, and some selectable class features. You can't retrain your ancestry, heritage, background, class, or ability scores. You can't perform other downtime activities while retraining.

Retraining usually requires you to spend time learning from a teacher, whether that entails physical training, studying at a library, or falling into shared magical trances. Your GM determines whether you can get proper training or whether something can be retrained at all. In some cases, you'll have to pay your instructor.

Some abilities can be difficult or impossible to retrain (for instance, a sorcerer can retrain their bloodline only in extraordinary circumstances).

When retraining, you generally can't make choices you couldn't make when you selected the original option. For instance, you can't exchange a 2nd-level skill feat for a 4th-level one, or for one that requires prerequisites you didn't meet at the time you took the original feat. If you don't remember whether you met the prerequisites at the time, ask your GM to make the call. If you cease to meet the prerequisites for an ability due to retraining, you can't use that ability. You might need to retrain several abilities in sequence in order to get all the abilities you want.

#### Feats
<sup>CRB p. 481</sup>

You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your feats. Remove the old feat and replace it with another of the same type. For example, you could swap a skill feat for another skill feat, but not for a wizard feat.

#### Skills
<sup>CRB p. 481</sup>

You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your skill increases. Reduce your proficiency rank in the skill losing its increase by one step and increase your proficiency rank in another skill by one step. The new proficiency rank has to be equal to or lower than the proficiency rank you traded away. For instance, if your bard is a master in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) and [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth), and an expert in [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), you could reduce the character's proficiency in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) to expert and become a master in [Occultism](compendium/skills.md#Occultism), but you couldn't reassign that skill increase to become legendary in [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance). Keep track of your level when you reassign skill increases; the level at which your skill proficiencies changed can influence your ability to retrain feats with skill prerequisites.

You can also spend a week to retrain an initial trained skill you gained during character creation.

#### Class Features
<sup>CRB p. 481</sup>

You can change a class feature that required a choice, making a different choice instead. This lets you change a druid order or a wizard school, for example. The GM will tell you how long this takes—always at least a month.

### Other Downtime Activities
<sup>CRB p. 481</sup>

Work with your GM if there are other ways you want to spend downtime. You might need to pay for your cost of living (the prices for this can be found on page 294).

You might acquire property, manage a business, become part of a guild or civic group, curry favor in a large city, take command of an army, take on an apprentice, start a family, or minister to a flock of the faithful.
