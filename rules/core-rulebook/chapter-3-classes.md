# Chapter 3: Classes
<sup>CRB p. 67</sup>

The rules within each class allow you to bring a wealth of character concepts to life. Perhaps you want to create a brilliant but scatterbrained alchemist who can rattle off complex formulas for alchemical items but has trouble remembering his best friend's birthday. Or perhaps you want your character to be a muscle-bound swordswoman who becomes as immovable as a mountain when she hoists a shield. Maybe they'll be a hot-tempered sorcerer whose gesticulating fingers pulse with light from an angelic ancestor. The choices you make for your character within their class—such as a cleric's choice of deity, a fighter's choice of weapon, or a sorcerer's bloodline—bring these visions to life within the context of the rules and the world.

The entries on the pages that follow describe the 12 core classes in Pathfinder. Each entry contains the information you need to play a character of that class, as well as to advance them from their humble beginnings at 1st level to the dizzying heights of power at 20th level. In addition to the class entries, you might need to reference the following sections, which detail additional character options and how to advance your character in level.

- **Leveling Up** on page 31 tells you how to make your character stronger when you get enough Experience Points to reach a new level.
- **Animal Companions and Familiars** on page 214 provides rules to create an animal companion or a familiar to share your adventures with. You must have a class feature or feat that grants you a companion or familiar to use these rules.
- **Archetypes** on page 219 gives you thematic options that allow you to further customize your character's abilities. Though these rules are not recommended for beginners, the archetypes in this book allow you to gain abilities from other classes starting at 2nd level.

## Reading Class Entries
<sup>CRB p. 67</sup>

Every class entry includes information about typical members of the class, plus suggestions for roleplaying characters of that class and playing these characters in the game's various modes. Each class provides your character with an ability boost to a key ability score; a number of Hit Points they receive at each level; proficiency ranks for various abilities, equipment, and skills; special abilities from their class features; and more. Your character's class entry also provides the information needed when they gain levels, so it will be a vital reference throughout the course of your campaign.

### Playing the Class
<sup>CRB p. 67</sup>

The first section of each class describes the interests and tendencies typical of that class, as well as information on how others view them. This can help inspire you as you determine your character's actions and define their personality, but you aren't obligated to play your character as this section describes.

### Key Ability
<sup>CRB p. 67</sup>

This is the ability score that a member of your class cares about the most. Many of your most useful and powerful abilities are tied to this ability in some way.

For instance, this is the ability score you'll use to determine the Difficulty Class (DC) associated with your character's class features and feats. This is called your class DC. If your character is a member of a spellcasting class, this key ability is used to calculate spell DCs and similar values.

Most classes are associated with one key ability score, but some allow you to choose from two options. For instance, if you're a fighter, you can choose either Strength or Dexterity as your key ability. A fighter who chooses Strength will excel in hand-to-hand combat, while those who choose Dexterity prefer ranged or [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md) weapons.

Additionally, when you choose your character's class, they gain an ability boost to their key ability score, increasing that ability score by 2. For more about ability boosts, see page 20.

### Hit Points
<sup>CRB p. 67</sup>

This section tells you how many Hit Points your character gains from their class at each level. To determine your character's starting Hit Points, add together the Hit Points they got when you chose their ancestry and the amount listed in this entry, which equals your Constitution modifier plus a fixed number.

Classes that intend for characters to rush into battle with weapons bared gain a higher number of Hit Points each level, while those for characters who cast spells or engage in trickery gain fewer.

Each time your character gains a level, they increase their maximum Hit Points by the amount listed in this entry.

For more about calculating your character's Constitution modifier and determining their Hit Points, see page 26.

### Initial Proficiencies
<sup>CRB p. 68</sup>

When you choose your character's class, they gain a set of initial proficiencies. Proficiencies measure your character's ability to perform tasks, use abilities, and succeed at checks.

Proficiency ranks range from trained to legendary. For instance, a character who is trained with a longbow can use it effectively, while a person who is legendary with the weapon might be able to split an arrow from 100 paces away!

Each class entry specifies your character's initial proficiency rank in Perception, saving throws, attacks, defenses, and either spells or class DC. You gain the trained proficiency rank in at least one skill that is important to your class, and you can choose other skills to gain trained proficiency in—the exact number depends on your class. If your class would make you trained in a skill you're already trained in (typically due to your background), you can select another skill to become trained in.

A proficiency rank can unlock various feats and class features, and it also helps determine the modifier for any check you roll or DC you calculate related to that statistic.

If your character is trained in Perception, a saving throw, or another statistic, they gain a proficiency bonus equal to their level + 2, while if they have expert proficiency, they gain a proficiency bonus equal to their level + 4. For more about proficiency ranks, see page 13.

Spellcasting classes grant a proficiency rank for spell attacks and DCs, which are further detailed in each class's entry.

If something isn't listed in your character's class entry, their proficiency rank in that statistic is untrained unless they gain training from another source. If your character is untrained in something, you add a proficiency bonus of +0 when attempting a check or calculating a DC related to that statistic.

### Advancement Table
<sup>CRB p. 68</sup>

This table summarizes the feats, skill increases, ability boosts, and other benefits your character gains as they advance in level. The first column of the class table indicates a level, and the second column lists each feature your character receives when they reach that level. The 1st-level entry includes a reminder to select your ancestry and background.

### Class Features
<sup>CRB p. 68</sup>

This section presents all the abilities the class grants your character. An ability gained at a higher level lists the required level next to the ability's name. All classes include the class features detailed below, and each class also gets special class features specific to it. Many class features require you to choose between options. Unless the specific ability states otherwise, such decisions can't be changed without retraining (as explained on page 481).

#### Class Feats
<sup>CRB p. 68</sup>

This section specifies the levels at which your character gains class feats—special feats that only members of that class can access. Class feats are granted beginning at 1st or 2nd level, depending on the class. Specific class feats are detailed at the end of each class entry.

#### Skill Feats
<sup>CRB p. 68</sup>

This section specifies the levels at which your character gains feats with the skill trait, called skill feats. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5: Feats, beginning on page 254. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, most classes gain a skill feat, though rogues gain them earlier and more often. Your character must be trained in the corresponding skill to take a skill feat.

#### General Feats
<sup>CRB p. 68</sup>

This section specifies the levels at which your character gains general feats. Most classes grant a general feat at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter. At each of these levels, you can select any general feat (including skill feats) as long as your character qualifies for it. More information can be found in Chapter 5: Feats (page 254).

#### Skill Increases
<sup>CRB p. 68</sup>

This section specifies the levels at which your character can increase their proficiency rank in a skill. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, most classes grant a skill increase, though rogues gain them earlier and more often.

Your character can use a skill increase to either become trained in one skill in which they're untrained or become an expert in one skill in which they're already trained.

If your character is at least 7th level, they can use a skill increase to become a master of a skill in which they're already an expert. If they're at least 15th level, they can use an increase to become legendary in a skill of which they're already a master.

#### Ability Boosts
<sup>CRB p. 68</sup>

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, your character boosts four different ability scores. Your character can use these ability boosts to increase their ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.

For more about ability boosts and applying them during character creation, see page 20.

#### Ancestry Feats
<sup>CRB p. 68</sup>

This section serves as a reminder of the ancestry feats your character gains at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.

Ancestry feats are detailed in each ancestry entry in Chapter 2, which begins on page 32.

- The alchemist uses their skill at crafting to create alchemical items—such as bombs, elixirs, and poisons—that they use to defeat foes and aid allies. Smart and resourceful, an alchemist often has just the right tool for the job and esoteric knowledge to help their friends get out of a jam.
- The barbarian is a fearsome embodiment of rage, focusing the deadly power of their anger against anyone who stands in their way. A barbarian is quick to enter battle and, once their fury has been unleashed, is immensely strong, often unpredictable, and nearly unstoppable.
- An artist and a scholar, the bard uses performance and esoteric learning to bolster their companions and foil their enemies. Sometimes sneaky and quite often charming, the bard adventures with pizzazz and talent backed up by an impressive repertoire of occult magic.
- A defender of good who straps on armor and wields a righteous weapon, the champion protects the innocent and vanquishes evil. Steadfast in their beliefs, and devoted to both a deity and an aspect of good, they follow a strict code as they fight to make the world a better place.
- The cleric is dedicated to the worship of a single deity and draws divine magic from this devotion. Clerics can be vastly different depending on who they worship, and whether they're cloistered clerics who pursue one of their deity's domains or war priests who serve as the sword arm of their god.
- The druid walks the wild, primordial places of the world without fear, harnessing the primal magic of nature and controlling it with calm purpose. A devotee of the wilderness, the druid finds nourishment in its power, allies among its creatures, and strength in its fury.
- With calculated daring and fearless determination, the fighter tracks down and confronts their enemies while defending allies from harm. A master of the battlefield, the fighter is quick to exploit opportunities and strike any who stumble within reach of their sword or bow.
- The monk seeks perfection in all things, and that includes transforming their body into the perfect weapon. They can be walking with calm purpose and contemplating the subtleties of existence in one minute and then transform into a blur of deadly blows in the next.
- Resourceful and cunning, the ranger is a hunter, tracker, and warrior who preserves the natural world and protects civilization from its ravages. Whether they use a bow, crossbow, a pair of weapons, or snares, the ranger is a fearsome enemy and great ally in the wild.
- Cunning and quick, the rogue brings skill and expertise few of their comrades can match. In battle, they excel at sneak attacks and ambushes. Their racket gives them the tools they need to get the job done, and their wide array of skill choices lets them specialize as they see fit.
- The intense magic the sorcerer commands comes from neither study nor worship—it comes from their blood. Their magical abilities depend on whether they have the blood of dragons, angels, fey, aberrant creatures, or some other being flowing through their veins and powering their spells.
- The wizard is the arcane master of spellcasting, plucking incredible power from reality through complicated spell formulas. They stride with confidence, without a need for armor or weapons, enacting their will upon the world and bringing woe upon their enemies.

## Animal Companions and Familiars
<sup>CRB p. 214</sup>

### Animal Companions
<sup>CRB p. 214</sup>

An animal companion is a loyal comrade who follows your orders without you needing to use Handle an Animal on it. Your animal companion has the [animal](rules/traits/animal.md) and [minion](rules/traits/minion.md) traits, and it gains 2 actions during your turn if you use the [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) action to command it; this is in place of the usual effects of [Command an Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md). If your companion dies, you can spend a week of downtime to replace it at no cost. You can have only one animal companion at a time.

#### Riding Animal Companions
<sup>CRB p. 214</sup>

You or an ally can ride your animal companion as long as it is at least one size larger than the rider. If it is carrying a rider, the animal companion can use only its land Speed, and it can't move and Support you on the same turn. However, if your companion has the mount special ability, it's especially suited for riding and ignores both of these restrictions.

#### Young Animal Companions
<sup>CRB p. 214</sup>

The following are the base statistics for a young animal companion, the first animal companion most characters get. You make adjustments to these statistics depending on the type of animal you choose. As you gain levels, you might make further adjustments as your companion becomes more powerful. An animal companion has the same level you do. Animal companions calculate their modifiers and DCs just as you do with one difference: the only item bonuses they can benefit from are to speed and AC (their maximum item bonus to AC is +2).

#### Proficiencies
<sup>CRB p. 214</sup>

Your animal companion uses your level to determine its proficiency bonuses. It's trained in its unarmed attacks, unarmored defense, barding, all saving throws, Perception, [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics), and [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics). Animal companions can't use abilities that require greater Intelligence, such as Coerce or Decipher Writing, even if trained in the appropriate skill, unless they have a specialization that allows it.

#### Ability Modifiers
<sup>CRB p. 214</sup>

An animal companion begins with base ability modifiers of **Str** +2, **Dex** +2, **Con** +1, **Int**–4, **Wis** +1, **Cha** +0. Each type has its own strengths and increases two of these modifiers by 1 each. These increases are already calculated into the stat blocks in Companion Types below.

#### Hit Points
<sup>CRB p. 214</sup>

Your animal companion has ancestry Hit Points from its type, plus a number of Hit Points equal to 6 plus its Constitution modifier for each level you have.

#### Mature Animal Companions
<sup>CRB p. 214</sup>

To advance a young animal companion to a mature animal companion (usually a result of one of your class feat choices), increase its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom modifiers by 1. Increase its unarmed attack damage from one die to two dice (for instance 1d8 to 2d8), and its proficiency rank for Perception and all saving throws to expert. Increase its proficiency ranks in [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth), and [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) to trained, and if it was already trained in one of those skills from its type, increase its proficiency rank in that skill to expert. If your companion is Medium or smaller, it grows by one size.

#### Nimble Animal Companions
<sup>CRB p. 214</sup>

To advance a mature animal companion to a nimble animal companion, increase its Dexterity modifier by 2 and its Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom modifiers by 1. It deals 2 additional damage with its unarmed attacks. Increase its proficiency ranks in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) to expert. It also learns the advanced maneuver for its type. Its attacks become magical for the purpose of ignoring resistances.

#### Savage Animal Companions
<sup>CRB p. 214</sup>

To advance a mature animal companion to a savage animal companion, increase its Strength modifier by 2 and its Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom modifiers by 1. It deals 3 additional damage with its unarmed attacks. Increase its proficiency rank in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) to expert. It also learns the advanced maneuver for its type. If your companion is Medium or smaller, it grows by one size. Its attacks become magical for the purpose of ignoring resistances.

#### Companion Types
<sup>CRB p. 214</sup>

The species of animal you choose is called your companion's type. Each companion type has its own statistics. The Size entry indicates your companion's starting size as a young animal companion. Following the size entry are the companion's unarmed attacks, and then its ability modifiers. The Hit Points entry indicates the companion's ancestry Hit Points. The Skill entry indicates an additional trained skill your companion has. The Senses entry lists your companion's special senses. The Speed entry gives your companion's Speeds. The Special entry, if present, lists any other special abilities your companion has, for example whether it often serves as a mount and is particularly appropriate for mounted classes, such as the champion.

The Support Benefit entry indicates a special benefit you gain by [Commanding the Animal](rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) to use the Support action (see below). The Advanced Maneuver entry indicates a powerful new action your companion learns how to use if it becomes a nimble or savage animal companion.

#### Specialized Animal Companions
<sup>CRB p. 217</sup>

Specialized animal companions are more intelligent and engage in more complex behaviors. The first time an animal gains a specialization, it gains the following: Its proficiency rank for unarmed attacks increases to expert. Its proficiency ranks for saving throws and Perception increase to master.

Increase its Dexterity modifier by 1 and its Intelligence modifier by 2. Its unarmed attack damage increases from two dice to three dice, and it increases its additional damage with unarmed attacks from 2 to 4 or from 3 to 6.

Each specialization grants additional benefits. Most animal companions can have only one specialization.

##### Ambusher
<sup>CRB p. 217</sup>

In your companion's natural environment, it can use a [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md) action even if it's currently observed. Its proficiency rank in [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) increases to expert (or master if it was already an expert from its type), and its Dexterity modifier increases by 1. Its proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to expert.

##### Bully
<sup>CRB p. 217</sup>

Your companion terrorizes foes with dominance displays and pushes them around the battlefield. Its proficiency ranks for [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) and [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) increase to expert (or master if it was already expert from its type), its Strength modifier increases by 1, and its Charisma modifier increases by 3.

##### Daredevil
<sup>CRB p. 217</sup>

Your companion joins the fray with graceful leaps and dives.

It gains the deny advantage|barbarian||3 ability, so it isn't [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures unless such a creature's level is greater than yours. Its proficiency rank in [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) increases to master, and its Dexterity modifier increases by 1. Its proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.

##### Racer
<sup>CRB p. 217</sup>

Your companion races. It gains a +10-foot status bonus to its Speed, swim Speed, or fly Speed (your choice). Its proficiency in Fortitude saves increases to legendary, and its Constitution modifier increases by 1.

##### Tracker
<sup>CRB p. 217</sup>

Your companion is an incredible tracker. It can move at full Speed while following tracks. Its proficiency rank in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) increases to expert (or master if it was already an expert from its type), and its Wisdom modifier increases by 1.

##### Wrecker
<sup>CRB p. 217</sup>

Your companion smashes things. Its unarmed attacks ignore half an object's Hardness. Its [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) proficiency increases to master, and its Strength modifier increases by 1.

### Familiars
<sup>CRB p. 217</sup>

Familiars are mystically bonded creatures tied to your magic. Most familiars were originally animals, though the ritual of becoming a familiar makes them something more. You can choose a Tiny animal you want as your familiar, such as a bat, cat, raven, or snake. Some familiars are different, usually described in the ability that granted you a familiar; for example, a druid's leshy familiar is a Tiny plant instead of an animal, formed from a minor nature spirit.

Familiars have the minion trait (page 634), so during an encounter, they gain 2 actions in a round if you spend an action to command them. If your familiar dies, you can spend a week of downtime to replace it at no cost.

You can have only one familiar at a time.

#### Modifiers and AC
<sup>CRB p. 217</sup>

Your familiar's save modifiers and AC are equal to yours before applying circumstance or status bonuses or penalties. Its Perception, [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics), and [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) modifiers are equal to your level plus your spellcasting ability modifier (Charisma if you don't have one, unless otherwise specified). If it attempts an attack roll or other skill check, it uses your level as its modifier. It doesn't have or use its own ability modifiers and can never benefit from item bonuses.

#### Hit Points
<sup>CRB p. 217</sup>

Your familiar has 5 Hit Points for each of your levels.

#### Size
<sup>CRB p. 218</sup>

Your familiar is Tiny.

#### Senses
<sup>CRB p. 218</sup>

Your familiar has [low-light vision](rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md) and can gain additional senses from familiar abilities. It can communicate empathically with you as long as it's within 1 mile of you, sharing emotions. It doesn't understand or speak languages normally, but it can gain speech from a familiar ability.

#### Movement
<sup>CRB p. 218</sup>

Your familiar has either a Speed of 25 feet or a swim Speed of 25 feet (choose one upon gaining the familiar).

It can gain other movement types from familiar abilities.

#### Familiar and Master Abilities
<sup>CRB p. 218</sup>

Each day, you channel your magic into two abilities, which can be either familiar or master abilities. If your familiar is an animal that naturally has one of these abilities (for instance, an owl has a fly Speed), you must select that ability. Your familiar can't be an animal that naturally has more familiar abilities than your daily maximum familiar abilities.

##### Familiar Abilities
<sup>CRB p. 218</sup>

- It gains a swim Speed of 25 feet (or Speed of 25 feet if it already has a swim Speed).
- It gains a burrow Speed of 5 feet, allowing it to dig Tiny holes.
- It gains a climb Speed of 25 feet.
- Choose one type of save. It takes no damage when it succeeds at that type of save; this doesn't prevent effects other than damage.
- It gains [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md).
- Increase one of the familiar's Speeds from 25 feet to 40 feet.
- It gains a fly Speed of 25 feet.
- It can understand and speak with animals of the same species. To select this, your familiar must be an animal, it must have the speech ability, and you must be at least 6th level.
- It can use your Quick Alchemy action. You must have Quick Alchemy, and your familiar must be in your space. This has the same cost and requirement as if you used it. It must have the manual dexterity ability to select this.
- It can use up to two of its limbs as if they were hands to use manipulate actions.
- It gains [scent](rules/abilities/scent.md) (imprecise, 30 feet).
- It understands and speaks a language you know.

##### Master Abilities
<sup>CRB p. 218</sup>

- You can prepare an additional cantrip, or if you have a repertoire, instead designate a cantrip to add to your repertoire every time you select this ability; you can retrain it but can't otherwise change it. You must be able to prepare cantrips or add them to your repertoire to select this.
- Your familiar grows extra infused reagents on or in its body. You gain an additional batch of infused reagents. You must have the infused reagents ability to select this ability.
- Once per day, your familiar can use 2 actions with the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md) to regain 1 Focus Point, up to your usual maximum You must have a focus pool to select this.
- If your familiar would be reduced to 0 HP by damage, as a reaction with the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md), you can take the damage. If you do, you take all the damage and your familiar takes none. However, if special effects when a hit damages your familiar (such as snake venom) still apply to your familiar.
- You gain one additional spell slot at least 3 levels lower than your highest-level spell slot; you must be able to cast 4th-level spells using spell slots to select this master ability.
- If your familiar is in your space, you can cast a spell with a range of touch, transfer its power to your familiar, and command the familiar to deliver the spell. If you do, the familiar uses its 2 actions for the round to move to a target of your choice and touch that target. If it doesn't reach the target to touch it this turn, the spell has no effect.

## Archetypes
<sup>CRB p. 219</sup>

Applying an archetype requires you to select archetype feats instead of class feats. Start by finding the archetype that best fits your character concept, and select the archetype's dedication feat using one of your class feat choices. Once you have the dedication feat, you can select any feat from that archetype in place of a class feat as long as you meet its prerequisites. The archetype feat you select is still subject to any selection restrictions on the class feat it replaces. For example, if you gained an ability at 6th level that granted you a 4th-level class feat with the dwarf trait, you could swap out that class feat only for an archetype feat of 4th level or lower with the dwarf trait. Archetype feats you gain in place of a class feat are called archetype class feats.

Occasionally, an archetype feat works like a skill feat instead of a class feat. These archetype feats have the skill trait, and you select them in place of a skill feat, otherwise following the same rules above. These are not archetype class feats (for instance, to determine the number of Hit Points you gain from the Fighter Resiliency archetype feat).

Each archetype's dedication feat represents a certain portion of your character's time and focus, so once you select a dedication feat for an archetype, you must satisfy its requirements before you can gain another dedication feat. Typically, you satisfy an archetype dedication feat by gaining a certain number of feats from the archetype's list. You cannot retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any other feats from that archetype.

Sometimes an archetype feat lets you gain another feat, such as the alchemist's basic concoction. You must always meet the prerequisites of the feat you gain in this way.

Two special kinds of archetypes are designated by the class and multiclass traits. The archetypes in this book are all multiclass archetypes.

### Multiclass Archetypes
<sup>CRB p. 219</sup>

Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying your training into another class's specialties. You can't select a multiclass archetype's dedication feat if you are a member of the class of the same name (for instance, a fighter can't select the Fighter Dedication feat).

### Class Archetypes
<sup>CRB p. 219</sup>

Archetypes with the class trait represent a fundamental divergence from your class's specialties, but one that exists within the context of your class. You can select a class archetype only if you are a member of the class of the same name. Class archetypes always alter or replace some of a class's static class features, in addition to any new feats they offer. It may be possible to take a class archetype at 1st level if it alters or replaces some of the class's initial class features.

In that case, you must take that archetype's dedication feat at 2nd level, and after that you proceed normally. You can never have more than one class archetype.

### Spellcasting Archetypes
<sup>CRB p. 219</sup>

Some archetypes grant you a substantial degree of spellcasting, albeit delayed compared to a character from a spellcasting class. In this book, the spellcasting archetypes are bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard, the multiclass archetypes for the five main spellcasting classes, but future books might introduce spellcasting archetypes that aren't multiclass archetypes.

A spellcasting archetype allows you to use scrolls, staves, and wands in the same way that a member of a spellcasting class can.

Spellcasting archetypes always grant the ability to cast cantrips in their dedication, and then they have a basic spellcasting feat, an expert spellcasting feat, and a master spellcasting feat. These feats share their name with the archetype; for instance, the wizard's master spellcasting feat is called Master Wizard Spellcasting.

All spell slots you gain from spellcasting archetypes have restrictions depending on the archetype; for instance, the bard archetype grants you spell slots you can use only to cast occult spells from your bard repertoire, even if you are a sorcerer with occult spells in your sorcerer repertoire.

**Basic Spellcasting Feat:** Usually available at 4th level, these feats grant a 1st-level spell slot. At 6th level, they grant you a 2nd-level spell slot, and if you have a spell repertoire, you can select one spell from your repertoire as a signature spell. At 8th level, they grant you a 3rd-level spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the "basic spellcasting benefits."

**Expert Spellcasting Feat:** Typically taken at 12th level, these feats make you an expert in spell attack rolls and DCs of the appropriate magical tradition and grant you a 4th-level spell slot. If you have a spell repertoire, you can select a second spell from your repertoire as a signature spell. At 14th level, they grant you a 5th-level spell slot, and at 16th level, they grant you a 6th-level spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the "expert spellcasting benefits."

**Master Spellcasting Feat:** Usually found at 18th level, these feats make you a master in spell attack rolls and DCs of the appropriate magical tradition and grant you a 7th-level spell slot. If you have a spell repertoire, you can select a third spell from your repertoire as a signature spell. At 20th level, they grant you an 8th-level spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the "master spellcasting benefits."
