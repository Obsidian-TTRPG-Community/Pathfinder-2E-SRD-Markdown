- The magus, a polymath of battle, trains in both spells and strikes. Combining these arts, a magus channels spells into their weapon or body to inflict devastating wounds upon their foes. The magus's versatility in combat and knowledge of the arcane makes them a welcome addition to any party.
- A summoner acts as the living anchor to a powerful being called an eidolon, which they call upon for aid. Summoners maintain deep connections with their eidolons, granting them the ability to influence the way the creature evolves. Eidolons manifest in many forms, including as constructs, demons, dragons, fey, and other creatures.

## Multiclass Archetypes
<sup>SoM p. 74</sup>

Applying an archetype requires you to select archetype feats instead of class feats. Find the archetype that best fits your character concept, and select the archetype's dedication feat using one of your class feat choices. Once you have the dedication feat, you can select any feat from that archetype in place of a class feat as long as you meet its prerequisites. The feat you select is still subject to any selection restrictions on the class feat it replaces. For example, if you gained an ability at 6th level that granted you a 4th-level class feat with the dwarf trait, you could swap out that class feat only for an archetype feat of 4th level or lower with the dwarf trait. Archetype feats you gain in place of a class feat are called archetype class feats.

Occasionally, an archetype feat works like a skill feat instead of a class feat. These archetype feats have the skill trait, and you select them in place of a skill feat, otherwise following the same rules above. These are not archetype class feats (for instance, to determine the number of Hit Points you gain from the [Fighter Resiliency](compendium/feats/fighter-resiliency.md) archetype feat).

Each archetype's dedication feat represents a certain portion of your character's time and focus, so once you select a dedication feat for an archetype, you must satisfy its requirements before you can gain another dedication feat. Typically, you satisfy an archetype dedication feat by gaining a certain number of feats from the archetype's list. You cannot retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any other feats from that archetype.

Sometimes an archetype feat lets you gain another feat, such as the summoner's [Basic Synergy](compendium/feats/basic-synergy-som.md). You must still meet the prerequisites of that feat.

Archetypes with the [multiclass](rules/traits/multiclass.md "Multiclass Feat Trait") trait, like both the magus and summoner archetypes, represent diversifying your training into another class's specialties. You can't select a multiclass archetype's dedication feat if you are a member of the class of the same name (for instance, a magus can't select the [Magus Dedication](compendium/feats/magus-dedication-som.md) feat).

### Bounded Spellcasting Archetype
<sup>SoM p. 74</sup>

Some archetypes, such as the magus and summoner multiclass archetypes, grant you spellcasting abilities based on the way magi and summoners cast spells, albeit delayed compared to a character from those classes. In this book, both archetypes are bounded spellcasting archetypes, but future books might introduce bounded spellcasting archetypes that aren't multiclass archetypes. A bounded spellcasting archetype allows you to use scrolls, staves, and wands in the same way that a member of a spellcasting class can, and the basic bounded spellcasting feat counts as having a spellcasting class feature.

Bounded spellcasting archetypes always have a basic bounded spellcasting feat, an expert bounded spellcasting feat, and a master bounded spellcasting feat. These feats share their name with the archetype. For instance, the magus's master spellcasting feat is called [Master Magus Spellcasting](compendium/feats/master-magus-spellcasting-som.md). All spell slots you gain from bounded spellcasting archetypes have restrictions depending on the archetype. For example, the summoner archetype grants you spell slots you can use only to cast spells from your summoner repertoire, even if you are a sorcerer with spells of the same tradition in your sorcerer repertoire.

**Basic Bounded Spellcasting Feat:** Usually gained at 6th level, these feats give you a 1st-level spell slot and a 2nd-level spell slot from that magical tradition. If you have a spell repertoire, you can select one spell from your repertoire as a signature spell. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the "basic bounded spellcasting benefits." At 10th level, you replace your 1st-level spell slot with a 3rd-level spell slot.

**Expert Bounded Spellcasting Feat:** Usually taken at 12th level, these feats make you an expert in spell attack rolls and DCs of the appropriate magical tradition. You gain an additional 3rd-level spell slot. If you have a spell repertoire, you can select a second spell from your repertoire as a signature spell. At 14th level, you replace your spell slots with two 4th-level spell slots and one 5th-level spell slot, and at 16th level, you replace your spell slots with two 5th-level spell slots and one 6th-level spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the "expert bounded spellcasting benefits."

**Master Bounded Spellcasting Feat:** Usually taken at 18th level, these feats make you a master in spell attack rolls and DCs of the appropriate magical tradition and grant you an additional 6th-level spell slot. At 20th level, they replace your two 5th-level spell slots with two 7th-level spell slots. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the "master bounded spellcasting benefits."

### Summoner
<sup>SoM p. 76</sup>

You have a tenuous connection to an eidolon, a bodiless being that shares your life force, and with effort you can manifest the eidolon into the world.

#### Multiclass Summoner Characters
<sup>SoM p. 76</sup>

- Alchemist summoners can use their eidolons as lab assistants or even as the source of experiments. They are a good fit for construct or plant eidolons.
- Barbarian summoners find themselves drawn to the fury of anger phantoms, the two fueled by the same inner instinct.
- Bard summoners inspire their eidolons to greater heights with their bardic performances. They often team up with eidolons who pair well with their muse, such as a fey eidolon for a polymath muse or a phantom eidolon for a warrior muse.
- Champion summoners get along best with divine eidolons matching the alignment associated with their causeâ€”angel eidolons for the tenets of good, devil eidolons for a tyrant, and so on. This allows the champion and eidolon to have a unity in philosophy and purpose that other eidolon choices might lack.
- Cleric summoners often find a connection to eidolons associated with their deity, such as a Sarenite cleric who chooses an angel eidolon. Clerics' ability to heal and support allows them to keep their eidolon healthy.
- Druid summoners find the life link with primal eidolons to be a religious experience. They are especially likely to bond with eidolons that match their order, such as plant eidolons for the leaf order or beast eidolons for the animal or wild order.
- Fighter summoners use tactics and techniques with their eidolons to best foes. They can partner with eidolons of any kind, but they work especially well with eidolons who provide utilities that complement their fighting style.
- Monk summoners often choose eidolons that are on their own path to enlightenment, to help enrich the monk's journey. These might be divine eidolons, especially if the monk is religious or uses divine ki spells, but they also might be phantoms seeking to transcend their phantom existence to reach the afterlife.
- Ranger summoners get along best with beast and plant eidolons, but they make a good team with other eidolons as well, especially when an archer ranger teams up with a melee eidolon.
- Rogue summoners gain a partner in crime that can disappear when necessary, providing the eidolon with the ultimate getaway as long as no one expects it to carry back loot from a heist. Rogues work well with tricky eidolons, such as fey, and they get a lot of mileage out of sharing their skills with their eidolon. The Unfetter Eidolon feat can be especially useful if the rogue wants to establish a quick alibi far from the eidolon's crimes.
- Sorcerer summoners often choose eidolons that match closely to their bloodline, such as a psychopomp eidolon for the psychopomp bloodline. The eidolon might even be part of the story of how the sorcerer gained their bloodline.
- Wizard summoners are especially appreciative of an eidolon to help them in combat, and they tend to favor arcane eidolons like dragon and construct eidolons.
