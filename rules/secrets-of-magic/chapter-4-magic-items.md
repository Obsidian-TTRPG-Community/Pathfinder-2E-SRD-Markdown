## Creating a Magic Item
<sup>SoM p. 155</sup>

As a crafter, creating a magic item is one of the most intensely personal projects you can undertake. While every serpentine wondrous figurine might more or less resemble a knotted snake carved out of jade, what type of snake is it? And what type of jade? Ten different figurines from ten different crafters could each show a distinct artistic mark, and experts can identify the handiwork of noteworthy crafters on sight. Similarly, items activated with commands typically each have unique utterances determined by the crafter. Before setting out to create a magic item, contemplate how your personality might inhabit and shape the item created.

## Investing a Magic Item
<sup>SoM p. 155</sup>

The word "preparation" means different things to different wearers of invested magic items. To some, investing a diadem of intellect may involve sitting silently with it at the beginning of the day and feeling the magical energy course through it and themselves, but others may simply pull the headband out of their rucksack, wipe it off, and give it a glance to make sure the gems aren't cracked. Still others might refuse to ever take the headband off in the first place, even while washing up or sleeping. Any of these could work! The difference between these habits isn't a matter of respect or proper vs. improper technique, it simply reflects what investiture means to the person using the item.

## Activating a Magic Item
<sup>SoM p. 155</sup>

You might activate a magic item flamboyantly, pragmatically, intensely, or off-handedly, but those choices are only external manifestations of how you activate the item. A deeper question is what the act of using a magic item feels like. Does the world seem to emit a deep thrum for an instant as a _[third eye](compendium/equipment/items/third-eye.md)_ gemstone sinks into your brow and manifests as a tattoo? Do you experience a counter-intuitive icy coolness when a blast from a _potion of dragon's breath_ explodes from your mouth? A wizard might have a step-by-step instruction list that they mentally follow when they use a _[staff of power](compendium/equipment/items/staff-of-power.md)_—potentially out of habit or concerns for safety. Imagining how you interact with magic items, some of which possess world-altering power, can be a revealing window into how you view your place in the cosmos.

## Collected Notes
<sup>SoM p. 155</sup>

In his 72 years as an amateur historian, Lambus of Magnimar amassed a collection of thousands of accounts of people's everyday encounters and experimentations with magic items from across Golarion. Excerpts from his impressive collection can be found throughout the Consumables and Permanent Items sections later in the chapter.

## Fulus
<sup>SoM p. 158</sup>

Many regional variants of fulus, each of which carries a different name, exist throughout Tian Xia. The workings behind the writings remained a secret until scholars correctly deduced that the charms were, in fact, edicts that commanded magic to act in the fashion prescribed by the talisman. Deciphering these writings allowed for the creation of fulus that draw power from sources as diverse as a witch's patron, an arcane legacy, or the changing of the seasons. For the creative adventurer, this lightweight paper makes a versatile tool with many potential applications.

### Fulu Rules
<sup>SoM p. 158</sup>

**[Fulu](rules/traits/fulu-som.md "Fulu Item Trait"):** Fulus are small paper charms that can be affixed to a suit of armor, a shield, a weapon, a creature, or even a structure. Some fulus are composed of multiple such charms, taking effect only once all have been affixed. Normal fulus have effects immediately once affixed, while fulu talismans have an effect only once activated. Once a fulu has been activated, it lasts for the given duration and then burns out. Unless otherwise noted, fulus expire one year after being created, reverting to mundane paper.

All fulus have the [fulu](rules/traits/fulu-som.md "Fulu Item Trait") and [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait") traits. Fulus also have a tradition trait—either [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait") or [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")—determined by the magical tradition of its creator. For example, a fulu created by a priest would have the [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait") trait, whereas a witch who dabbles in fate might create a fulu with the [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait") trait. Some fulus also have the [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait") trait, if they work similarly to talismans (such as being affixed to a suit of armor, a shield, or a weapon.

Each fulu's stat block indicates the type of item or creature it can be affixed to. Affixing or removing a fulu requires using the [Affix a Fulu](rules/actions/affix-a-fulu-som.md) activity, or the [Affix a Talisman](rules/actions/affix-a-talisman.md) action instead if the fulu is also a talisman.

### Using Fulus
<sup>SoM p. 158</sup>

Beyond fulu talismans, non-talisman fulus can be affixed or removed easily, though removing a fulu causes it to immediately burn out. The paper is fragile, easily destroyed by hazards such as water, fire, or an observant enemy when either unattended or affixed to the ground or a structure. Fulus that are also talismans use the normal rules for Affixing and removing talismans instead of the action presented here.

![Affix a Fulu](rules/actions/affix-a-fulu-som.md)

### Crafting a Fulu
<sup>SoM p. 158</sup>

Fulus can be created using the [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) skill like any other magic item, and they have a batch size of four, meaning you can Craft four copies of the same fulu at a time. A fulu's script consists of symbols citing the person or place from which the fulu draws power, a symbol of command, details of the desired effect, and other formulaic elements to complete the charm. Each part is written as the crafter recites a spell mantra, with the crafter's powers and magic essences weaving into the ink and paper. As creating a fulu requires knowledge of these mantras, a fulu can't be disassembled to learn its formula like many other items—the formula for a fulu can be learned only firsthand.

Unlike most items, the ritualistic aspect of fulus' creation allows the creator to expedite the process, though doing so decreases the fulus' stability. A character with the formula for a fulu can [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) up to four fulus for their full price in a single day of downtime, rather than taking four days as normal for the [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) downtime activity. However, if they do so, the fulus only last for a month, rather than a year. This is perfect for fulus you expect to use soon after [Crafting](rules/actions/craft.md) them, as in that case, there isn't much difference between a month and a year.

### Fulus
<sup>SoM p. 158</sup>

The following are some of the fulus most frequently seen in temples and on armors and weapons. While divine fulus are most common on Golarion, fulus of all traditions are generally available, so the fulus in this section list the magical trait as a placeholder.

> [!pf2-sidebar] Real-Life Usage
> 
> In the real world, "fulu" refers to two divine instruments found in Daoist traditions. "Fu" refers to warding talismans, and "lu" are writs for summoning divine soldiers or spirits; both can still be found in use by Daoist temples and folk religions. Unlike in Golarion, fulus that draw power from unrecognized divine figures or use ahistorical symbols are considered frauds. Some temples have attempted to reduce predatory appropriation by recording their talismans' meanings (though not how to create them) in informative manuals.

> [!pf2-sidebar] Creating Your Own Fulu
> 
> Many fulus replicate spell effects, functioning much like scrolls affixed onto the targets. As the GM, if you want to create a new fulu using this concept, in general, the number of fulus needed to replicate a spell is the same as the number of actions required to Cast the Spell. You can draw that full set of fulus into one hand with the same [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action. While this means affixing time is equal to casting time, the fulus don't need to be affixed on the same turn, so take that into account when deciding whether or how to build a particular fulu. If a spell has more than three targets, such as a heightened [remove fear](compendium/spells/remove-fear.md), you might allow for the creation of a fulu that's affixed to the ground and that affects targets within a certain distance once a character places the last one.

#### Fulu Items
<sup>SoM p. 161</sup>

The following items are associated with fulus.

- [Fulu Compendium](compendium/equipment/items/fulu-compendium-som.md)

## Grimoires
<sup>SoM p. 161</sup>

Most grimoires can hold up to 100 spells, like any spellbook, but allow spellcasters to erase spells written by a book's previous owner in favor of spells that employ their own magical formulas. If a spellcaster wants to transfer their spells from one of their spellbooks to a grimoire, they can conduct a simple, 1-minute ritual with the two books to cause the spells to vanish from their spellbook and appear in the grimoire.

If you prepare spells (whether from your class features, like a cleric or wizard, or from a special feat or ability, like the Esoteric Polymath bard feat), you can study a grimoire during your daily preparations to enhance one or more of the spells within. Until your next daily preparations, you gain the ability to Activate the grimoire. As you've already absorbed the power from the grimoire during your daily preparations, you can Activate it even if you later lose possession of the book itself. Grimoires' benefits apply only to spells cast via spell slots—not cantrips, focus spells, or innate spells. No one can use more than one grimoire per day, nor can a grimoire be used by more than one person per day.

### Grimoires

A few of the grimoires known to exist are listed here.

## Magical Tattoos
<sup>SoM p. 164</sup>

Tattooing is a precise art, and making magical tattoos requires developing a special rapport between the artist and their living canvas. For this reason, it can be difficult to find someone to ink a magical tattoo on your body. (Consequently, most most magical tattoos other than the ones appearing here are uncommon.) Securing such services might require a person to achieve notable deeds, become a member of a community, or prove their character and commitment to the artist.

Most magical tattooing requires the same tools as traditional methods, just using magical inks and, sometimes, magical implements, such as needles, bone tattooing rakes, or the like. Some processes, including certain traditional Varisian methods, etch the magic directly into the skin without puncturing it. The pain remains the same.

### Tattooing Rules
<sup>SoM p. 164</sup>

To craft a magical tattoo, you must be able to craft magic items and have a specialty in tattooing. You can attain these requirements by taking the [Tattoo Artist](compendium/feats/tattoo-artist-tv.md) skill feat below, or you can take both the [Magical Crafting](compendium/feats/magical-crafting.md) and [Specialty Crafting](compendium/feats/specialty-crafting.md) skill feats, choosing artistry as your specialty.

#### Crafting A Tattoo
<sup>SoM p. 164</sup>

Inking a magical tattoo onto a creature is much like etching a rune onto an item. The tattooist uses the [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) activity, and the subject must be present throughout the process. The tattooist must meet any special [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) requirements, and they can ink only one tattoo at a time. Not only does a magical tattoo not have any effect until the [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) activity is complete, but it also requires a healing period. Though this time frame can last up to a month, applying magical or alchemical healing can shorten it to as little as a day.

#### The Tattoo Trait
<sup>SoM p. 164</sup>

A magical tattoo has the [tattoo](rules/traits/tattoo-lowg.md "Tattoo Item Trait") trait. It's permanently a part of the subject's body, and reduces the number of items that creature can invest per day by 1. Each tattoo has the [invested](rules/traits/invested.md "Invested Item Trait") trait to indicate this limitation—a magical tattoo is like an invested item that the tattooed creature has no choice but to invest. If the tattoo loses its magic or is destroyed, it no longer reduces your investiture. Just like a physical magic item, a magical tattoo can be counteracted by spells like [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) or [disjunction](compendium/spells/disjunction.md). If destroyed, the tattoo fades from the skin.

If a creature gets a new magical tattoo when their limit on invested items has already been reduced to zero, the new tattoo's magic fails to take hold, and it becomes a non-magical tattoo instead. However, a tattooist can alter an existing tattoo when they [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) a tattoo, modifying the old one into a different magical tattoo and removing the old effect. Magical tattoos can usually be 11 into their greater versions by having a tattooist add to or modify the existing tattoo.

## Personal Staves
<sup>SoM p. 166</sup>

A custom staff is always unique, and you need your GM's permission to create one and introduce it to your game.

### Creating a Personal Staff
<sup>SoM p. 166</sup>

Establishing magical pathways to turn a simple piece of wood or metal into a staff is no simple matter. Without some structure to bind multiple disparate spells to a single staff, the magic would surely fail. Thus, a custom staff must always be created around a single trait. For example, an elemental trait (air, earth, fire, or water), energy trait (acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic, positive, negative, or force), alignment trait, the detection trait, the light trait, and so on. The staff and its spells must have the trait. A few traits are too broad to use, including incapacitation and the traits for spell schools and traditions. The GM might add others to this list.

#### Determining Level And Price
<sup>SoM p. 166</sup>

Your level sets a personal staff's maximum item level, which determines the Price and the number and level of spells the staff can have, as shown on the table below.

![Personal Staves](rules/tables/personal-staves-som.md)

#### Picking Your Spells
<sup>SoM p. 166</sup>

Once you've decided the trait, choose the spells to inscribe. They must share the trait you chose for the staff. For instance, your undine sorcerer might create a _deep sea staff_ themed around the [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") trait, inscribing it with spells such as [create water](compendium/spells/create-water.md) and [hydraulic push](compendium/spells/hydraulic-push.md).

You can inscribe a number of common spells on the staff depending on its level, as shown on the table below. You can place the same spell into the staff at multiple levels to provide heightened versions, though doing so uses up one of your picks for that spell level. You can add a spell you can't cast to a staff by supplying a casting of it via another caster or by using [Trick Magic Item](compendium/feats/trick-magic-item.md); however, since you can cast a spell from a staff only if it's on your spell list, this option isn't useful for most characters.

#### Example
<sup>SoM p. 166</sup>

Lini, a 15th-level druid, wants to create a staff to interact with the plants she encounters. She chooses the plant trait to represent that theme. Next, she selects some common spells for the staff, starting with one cantrip and adding one or two spells at each level, up to the staff's maximum spell level. To build a 15th-level staff with 6th-level spells, she selects the following combination of spells:

- Cantrip: [tanglefoot](compendium/spells/tanglefoot.md)
- 1st: protector tree, [shillelagh](compendium/spells/shillelagh.md)
- 2nd: [entangle](compendium/spells/entangle.md), [shape wood](compendium/spells/shape-wood.md)
- 3rd: [tree shape](compendium/spells/tree-shape.md), [wall of thorns](compendium/spells/wall-of-thorns.md)
- 4th: [barkskin](compendium/spells/barkskin.md), [speak with plants](compendium/spells/speak-with-plants.md)
- 5th: [plant form](compendium/spells/plant-form.md), [wall of thorns](compendium/spells/wall-of-thorns.md)
- 6th: nature's reprisal, [plant form](compendium/spells/plant-form.md)

Note that some of these spells are duplicates of lower-level spells, which can be a great way to fill in levels if new spells don't appeal to you. It's usually best to choose a spell for one of these slots that has an extra benefit when heightened (such as plant form giving you better statistics), but even if you don't find a spell with such a benefit, it's worth filling every open slot.

#### Crafting the Staff
<sup>SoM p. 166</sup>

> [!pf2-sidebar] Staff of Nature's Cunning
> 
> You might want to take a version of the Lini's Leafstick for your own character or to give out as treasure in a campaign. To make that easier, here's a non-unique version with multiple types for different levels.
> 
> [Staff of Nature's Cunning](compendium/equipment/items/staff-of-natures-cunning-som.md)

Once you've themed and designed your staff, you can craft it with the following the guidelines, along with previously established rules for crafting magical items.

As with normal staves, one casting of all listed levels of all spells in the staff must be provided during [Crafting](rules/actions/craft.md).

Choose a magical school for your staff from among the schools the spells on it have. Pick the one that best reflects the spells, usually the one most shared among them. You can optionally give your staff a trait for one magic tradition, instead of the [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") trait, if the staff is fully steeped in that tradition and contains spells only from that tradition's spell list.

You still need to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) the staff. If you're not good at [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting), you can have somebody use the [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) activity for you, but you must be present the whole time. Since the creation of a custom staff is [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait"), you and the GM might decide to have a special quest for esoteric ingredients and methods as part of the story.

##### Example
<sup>SoM p. 167</sup>

Lini selected mostly transmutation spells for her staff, so she chooses the [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait") trait. She could give it the primal trait, but choses to keep it open with the [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") trait, much like the [verdant staff](compendium/equipment/items/verdant-staff.md) in the Core Rulebook.

To Craft the staff, Lini follows the normal rules. She provides 3,250 gp in raw materials, spends 4 days at work, and attempts a [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check. Each day she works on it, she prepares the spells she needs to put into the staff given its Craft Requirements.

#### Naming The Staff
<sup>SoM p. 167</sup>

When your staff is complete, give it a name—though skeptics might sneer, spellcasters believe that naming a staff upon creation will help it attune to its new master.

##### Example
<sup>SoM p. 167</sup>

Lini christens her new creation _Lini's Leafstick_!

![Lini's Leafstick](compendium/equipment/items/linis-leafstick-som.md)

### Revising the Staff
<sup>SoM p. 166</sup>

As you level up, your staff will get less useful unless you upgrade it. You might also want to make revisions as you play if you come to dislike the spells you chose.

To change spells already in the staff, use the [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) activity with a Price equal to 1/10th the staff's Price. You can swap out any of the spells in the staff when you finish. The new spells have to have the staff's chosen trait and be an appropriate level, just as though you were choosing them when initially making the staff, and you must provide castings of them.

Upgrading the staff is similar to 11 an item to a higher-level version. Decide the staff's new level. Pay the difference in Price, pick the new spells, and use [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) for the upgrade. You must supply castings of the new spells. Upgrading doesn't let you switch any of the spells you'd previously chosen.

## Spell Catalysts
<sup>SoM p. 167</sup>

Items with the [catalyst](rules/traits/catalyst-som.md "Catalyst Item Trait") trait are consumable material spell components that alter or magnify specific spells. [Activating](rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) a catalyst is part of [Casting the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md). The catalyst might increase the number of actions required to Cast the Spell, as indicated in the catalyst's Activate entry. Additionally, the spell gains material components if it didn't have them already or adds the catalyst to its existing components. Because the catalyst becomes part of the material components, you can draw the catalyst as part of [Casting the Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md).

## Spellhearts
<sup>SoM p. 170</sup>

Unlike talismans, a spellheart can be used repeatedly, and doesn't burn out after use. Each spellheart can be attached to different items, giving a benefit depending on your choice, which means you can plan ahead in facing expected dangers. They have the spellheart trait.

**[Spellheart](rules/traits/spellheart-som.md "Spellheart Equipment Trait")**: Spellhearts are permanent items that work similarly to talismans. You affix a spellheart using the [Affix a Spellheart](rules/actions/affix-a-talisman.md) activity, which is otherwise identical to [Affix a Talisman](rules/actions/affix-a-talisman.md). The limit of one talisman per item remains—an item can have one spellheart or one talisman, not both. The rules related to talismans and affixing them are on page 565 of the Core Rulebook. When casting a cantrip from a spellheart, you can use your own spell attack roll or spell DC if it's higher. [Crafting](rules/actions/craft.md) a spellheart requires the spells the spellheart can cast. For example, a major five-feather wreath requires [air walk](compendium/spells/air-walk.md), gale blast, and [wall of wind](compendium/spells/wall-of-wind.md).
