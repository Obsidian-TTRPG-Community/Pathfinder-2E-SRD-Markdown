| `d6` | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Transforms into a sandy material, making the area difficult terrain. |
| 2 | Crystallizes into razor shards, dealing 5d6 slashing damage to creatures that use the Stride action in the area (DC 26 basic Reflex save). |
| 3 | Transforms into a surface more slippery than glass, making the area difficult terrain. Creatures that Stride in the area must succeed at a DC 26 Acrobatics check or fall prone. |
| 4 | Liquefies into a pool of molten metal, dealing 5d6 fire damage to creatures that begin their turn in the area (DC 26 basic Reflex save). |
| 5 | Transforms into a glue-like substance. To Stride in the area, creatures must first succeed at a DC 26 Athletics check to pull their legs free. |
| 6 | The metal becomes inert and has no effect. It begins in this state. |
