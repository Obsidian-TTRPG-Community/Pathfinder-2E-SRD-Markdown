# Alignment Aura  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 328*  

The strength of an alignment aura depends on the level of the creature, item, or spell. The auras of undead, clerics and other divine spellcasters with a patron deity, and creatures from the Outer Sphere are one step stronger than normal (faint instead of none, for example).

| Creature Item Level | Spell or Effect Level | Aura Strength |
|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| 0-5 | â€” | None |
| 6-10 | 0-3 | Faint |
| 11-15 | 4-7 | Moderate |
| 16-20 | 8-9 | Powerful |
| 21+ | 10 | Overwhelming |
