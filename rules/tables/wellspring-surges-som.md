# Wellspring Surges  
*Source: Secrets of Magic p. 250*  

| `d20` | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | **Energy Unleashed** ([evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")) Raw energy deals 2d6 damage per spell level of the surge (basic Reflex save) in a 10-foot burst. |
| 2 | **Positive Energy Expulsion** ([healing](rules/traits/healing.md "Healing Effect Trait"), [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait"), [positive](rules/traits/positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait")) Positive energy explodes outward, healing living creatures for 1d8 Hit Points per spell level of the surge in a 20-foot burst. Undead creatures instead take the same amount of positive damage, with a basic Will save. |
| 3 | **Mass Siphon** ([transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")) Creatures and objects within a 30-foot emanation become nearly weightless until the end of your next turn. Nearly weightless creatures can [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md) at their land Speed and can [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) as far upward as they could normally [Leap](rules/actions/leap.md) horizontally. |
| 4 | **Magical Nemesis** ([conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait"), [teleportation](rules/traits/teleportation.md "Teleportation Effect Trait")) A random creature connected to your magic (or inimical to it) appears within 60 feet. The creature should be of a level approximately equal to the level of an animal summoned by [summon animal](compendium/spells/summon-animal.md) of the spell level, although it can be of any type. The GM determines the specific creature. The creature is [unfriendly](rules/conditions.md#Unfriendly) to you and friendly to your apparent enemies. After 1 minute, the creature can choose either to return where it came from or to remain. It is not [summoned](rules/traits/summoned.md "Summoned Creature Trait") or a [minion](rules/traits/minion.md "Minion Creature Trait"). |
| 5 | **Monstrous Transformation** ([mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait"), [morph](rules/traits/morph.md "Morph Effect Trait"), [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")) Your head and arms transform into an exaggerated imitation of a creature connected to your magic for 1 minute. The GM determines the creature. You gain a status bonus to weapon and unarmed damage rolls equal to the spell level. At the start of each of your turns while you are transformed, you must succeed at a Will saving throw or be [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused) until the start of your next turn. On a critical success, you can choose to end the effect entirely, also losing the status bonus. |
| 6 | **Sudden Gale** ([air](rules/traits/air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait"), [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")) Weather in a 40-foot emanation is disturbed. Strong winds blow in a random direction for 1 minute. Each creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) (and be pushed 10 feet on a critical failure), and you must succeed at this save immediately after the surge. Any movement against the wind is difficult terrain, or greater difficult terrain while flying. |
| 7 | **Tremor** ([earth](rules/traits/earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait"), [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")) The earth trembles in a 40-foot emanation. Each creature on a surface must immediately succeed at a Fortitude save or fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone). The surface then becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. |
| 8 | **Oppressive Voice** ([divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait"), [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait"), [nonlethal](rules/traits/nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait")) The voice of your muse, your deity, an ancestor, or another appropriate entity suddenly overwhelms your mind. You must attempt a Will saving throw. You take 1d4 mental damage per spell level with a basic Will save. On a failure, you're also [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) ([stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) on a critical failure). |
| 9 | **Trinket Squall** ([illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")) Visual illusions of objects related to your magic fall like rain throughout a 40-foot burst for 1 minute, giving concealment in the area. Creatures can attempt to 0. |
| 10 | **Antimagic Eruption** ([abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")) The surge attempts to counteract a random spell active on you and on each creature within a 10-foot burst. |
| 11 | **Mental Broadcast** ([detection](rules/traits/detection.md "Detection Effect Trait"), [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait"), [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")) For 1 minute, everyone within 30 feet of you can hear your surface thoughts. |
| 12 | **Verdant Clutch** ([conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait"), [plant](rules/traits/plant.md "Plant Creature Type Trait")) Plants and vines grow from all surfaces within 20 feet, causing all creatures in the area to be [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) unless they succeed at a Reflex save. The [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) DC is equal to the spell DC. |
| 13 | **Tinge of Terror** ([emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait"), [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait"), [fear](rules/traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait"), [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")) All creatures within 20 feet are affected by powerful fright. They attempt a Will save, becoming [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a failure or [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical failure. |
| 14 | **Strike up the Band** ([auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait"), [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")) For 1 minute, you are followed by orchestral theme music tied to the emotional content of the actions you're performing. This grants you a +2 status bonus to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), and [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) checks, a –2 status penalty to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) checks, and makes certain uses of [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) virtually impossible. It might have other effects as the GM sees fit. |
| 15 | **Life Sap** ([necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")) The surge drains your life force and strength. You become [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) and [doomed](rules/conditions.md#Doomed), and you are [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 minute. |
| 16 | **Ablative Barrier** ([abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")) Energy forms a protective barrier that ablates slowly as creatures in the area take damage. All creatures in a 40-foot burst gain resistance to all damage equal to double the surge's spell level for up to 1 minute. Whenever a creature applies this resistance, the resistance for all affected creatures reduces by 1. The effect ends for all creatures when it reduces to 0. |
| 17 | **Luminous Pests** ([illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md "Illusion School Trait"), [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")) Numerous tiny flying creatures formed of bright colorful light, such as bats or hummingbirds, emerge from you, flying in a 30-foot cone. You and all creatures in the cone must succeed at a Will save or be [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute, or [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round and then [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute on a critical failure. |
| 18 | **Emotional Turmoil** ([emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait"), [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait"), [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")) A swirl of conflicting emotions overwhelm you from the surging magic. For 1 minute, attempt a DC 11 flat check at the start of each of your turns. On a success, you gain a +2 status bonus to all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks; on a failure, you take a –2 status penalty to them instead. |
| 19 | **Sudden Downpour** ([evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md "Evocation School Trait"), [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait")) Water cascades from above, putting out non-magical fires in a 10-foot burst and attempting to counteract magical fires. |
| 20 | **Spell Surge** You immediately cast any spell in your repertoire of the surge's spell level or lower (or from your prepared spells or innate spells if you don't have a repertoire but have been forced to generate a wellspring surge). You must choose a spell that takes 3 or fewer actions to cast. |
