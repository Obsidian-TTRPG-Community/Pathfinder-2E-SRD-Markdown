# Hustle (basic)
[exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md "Exploration Action & Ability Trait")  [move](rules/traits/move.md "Move Combat Trait")  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 480*  



You strain yourself to move at double your travel speed. You can Hustle only for a number of minutes equal to your Constitution modifier × 10 (minimum 10 minutes). If you are in a group that is Hustling, use the lowest Constitution modifier among everyone to determine how fast the group can Hustle together.
