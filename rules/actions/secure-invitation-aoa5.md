# Secure Invitation
[downtime](rules/traits/downtime.md "Downtime Action & Ability Trait")  
*Source: Age of Ashes #5: Against the Scarlet Triad p. 24*  


The PC seeks out someone with an invitation they're willing to sell.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The PC finds an invitation-holder and convinces them to give away the invitation for free. The PCs gain 1 Edge Point.
> - **Success** The PC finds someone willing to sell their invitation for 250 gp. If they pay, the group gets 1 Edge Point. They can attempt to steal it instead (DC 34 [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery)), but if they do, increase Awareness at the beginning of Phase 2: Infiltration by 2.
> - **Failure** The PC is unable to find an invitation.
