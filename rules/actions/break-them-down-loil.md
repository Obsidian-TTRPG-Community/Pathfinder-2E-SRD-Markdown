**Class** gunslinger; **Subclass** Triggerbrand
- **Activity**: Two-Action

Your foes are but dross from which you carve and shoot your legend. Make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) and then a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a combination weapon, both against the same enemy; you don't need to change modes to do so. If the melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) hits, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the attack roll with the ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but your multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until you've made both attacks. If both [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) hit, you deal an additional `2d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to the enemy, and they're [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until this [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) ends.
