# Cunning Disguise
[exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md "Exploration Action & Ability Trait")  
*Source: Age of Ashes #5: Against the Scarlet Triad p. 27*  


The PCs conceal their true identities, relying on false personas to be admitted onto the estate. A PC can use a skill closely connected to their chosen disguise in place of [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), such as [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) for a guard, [Guild Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) for a merchant, or any food-related [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) for a caterer.

If a PC succeeds at a Cunning Disguise, roll a secret DC 34 [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check for them to notice something off about one of the guests. On a success, inform them about the [Dispel a Disguise](rules/actions/dispel-a-disguise-aoa5.md) Opportunity.
