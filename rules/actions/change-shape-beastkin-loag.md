- **Activity**: Single Action

You change into your humanoid or hybrid shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance, and most beastkin remain in their hybrid shapes by default. In hybrid shape, you appear as a mix between your ancestry and your inherent animal. While in hybrid shape, you gain a jaws unarmed Strike resembling the features of your inherent animal (fangs for bats, beaks for eagles, mandibles for wasps, and so on). Your jaws deal `1d4` piercing damage, have the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md), [finesse](rules/traits/finesse.md), and [unarmed](rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits, and are in the brawling weapon group. In your humanoid shape, you retain the appearance of your original ancestry.
