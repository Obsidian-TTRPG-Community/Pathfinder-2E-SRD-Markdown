# Seek the Hidden Forge
[downtime](rules/traits/downtime.md "Downtime Action & Ability Trait")  [secret](rules/traits/secret.md "Secret General Trait")  
*Source: Age of Ashes #4: Fires of the Haunted City p. 18*  

- **Requirements**: At least one Hidden Forge clue.

By spending a day examining Hidden Forge clues, consulting with locals, studying maps of Kovlar, and otherwise investigating the mystery, a PC attempts to determine the location of the secret shrine to [Droskar](compendium/setting/deities/droskar-logm.md) in the dwarven city. A character can attempt to interpret these clues with a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception), [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society), or [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) checkâ€”the DC remains 36 regardless of the check used to interpret the clues. This DC is reduced by 2 for each Hidden Forge clue possessed beyond the first. Thus, if the character has access to two Hidden Forge Clues, the DC is reduced to 34, up to a maximum reduction to DC 22 if a character has 8 Hidden Forge Clues.
