[exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md "Exploration Action & Ability Trait")  [move](rules/traits/move.md "Move Combat Trait")  
*Source: Age of Ashes #5: Against the Scarlet Triad p. 13*  


You pack up as many supplies as you can carry and make your way back to Bazal's Basin with food and water. Attempt a DC 34 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to determine the amount and quality of the food you manage to haul and keep safe from being damaged in the storm. A character who uses powerful magic (such as [teleport](compendium/spells/teleport.md)) to aid in transporting the food automatically achieves a result one category higher than they roll.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You return with 15 Bulk of supplies.
> - **Success** You return with 10 Bulk of supplies.
> - **Failure** Some of the food was damaged in transport, and you return with only 5 Bulk of supplies.
> - **Critical Failure** All of the supplies you attempted to transport are ruined.
