# Squeeze (basic)
[exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md)  [move](rules/traits/move.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 241*  

**Skill** [acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) (trained)

You contort yourself to squeeze through a space so small you can barely fit through. This action is for exceptionally small spaces; many tight spaces are difficult terrain that you can move through more quickly and without a check.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You squeeze through the tight space in 1 minute per 10 feet of squeezing.
> - **Success** You squeeze through in 1 minute per 5 feet.
> - **Critical Failure** You become stuck in the tight space. While you're stuck, you can spend 1 minute attempting another [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check at the same DC. Any result on that check other than a critical failure causes you to become unstuck.
