**Skill** [athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) (untrained)
- **Activity**: Single Action

You propel yourself through water. In most calm water, you succeed at the action without needing to attempt a check. If you must breathe air and you're submerged in water, you must hold your breath each round. If you fail to hold your breath, you begin to drown (as described on page 478). If the water you are swimming in is turbulent or otherwise dangerous, you might have to attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to Swim.

If you end your turn in water and haven't succeeded at a Swim action that turn, you sink 10 feet or get moved by the current, as determined by the GM. However, if your last action on your turn was to enter the water, you don't sink or move with the current that turn.
