# Take Cover (basic) [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 471*  


- **Requirements**: You are benefiting from cover, are near a feature that allows you to take cover, or are [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
- **Activity**: Single Action

You press yourself against a wall or duck behind an obstacle to take better advantage of cover. If you would have standard cover, you instead gain greater cover, which provides a +4 circumstance bonus to AC; to Reflex saves against area effects; and to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md), [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md), or otherwise avoid detection. Otherwise, you gain the benefits of standard cover (a +2 circumstance bonus instead). This lasts until you move from your current space, use an [attack](rules/traits/attack.md) action, become [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), or end this effect as a free action.
