**Variant Rule** Hexploration

As long as your group has successfully [Reconnoitered](rules/actions/reconnoiter-gmg.md) the hex, you can use this activity to create an accurate map of the hex with a successful [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) check (typically at a trained or expert DC). When you have an accurate map of the hex, the DC of any check to navigate that hex is reduced by 2.
