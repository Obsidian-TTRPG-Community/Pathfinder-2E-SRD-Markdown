# Grapple (basic) [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[attack](rules/traits/attack.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 242*  

**Skill** [athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) (untrained)
- **Requirements**: You have at least one free hand or have your target grappled or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained). Your target cannot be more than one size larger than you.
- **Activity**: Single Action

You attempt to grab an opponent with your free hand. Attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check against their Fortitude DC. You can also Grapple to keep your hold on a creature you already grabbed or restrained.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Your opponent is [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) until the end of your next turn unless you move or your opponent [Escapes](rules/actions/escape.md).
> - **Success** Your opponent is [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) until the end of your next turn unless you move or your opponent [Escapes](rules/actions/escape.md).
> - **Failure** You fail to grab your opponent. If you already had the opponent [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) using a Grapple, those conditions on that creature end.
> - **Critical Failure** If you already had the opponent [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained), it breaks free. Your target can either grab you, as if it succeeded at using the Grapple action against you, or force you to fall and land [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
