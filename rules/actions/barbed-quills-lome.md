# Barbed Quills [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
*Source: Lost Omens: The Mwangi Expanse p. 123*  

**Ancestry** Shisk; **Heritage** Shisk|LOME|Quillcoat|Quillcoat|LOME|
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You are hit with an unarmed strike or a strike with a non-reach melee weapon.
- **Activity**: Reaction

You break off quills in your attacker's flesh. You deal `1d8` piercing damage to the triggering creature (basic Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.) On a critical failure, the creature also takes `1d4` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) as your quills hook into its flesh. At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this damage increases by `1d8` and the persistent piercing damage increases by 1.
