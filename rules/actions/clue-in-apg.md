You share information with the triggering creature. They gain a circumstance bonus to their check equal to your circumstance bonus to checks investigating your subject from [Pursue a Lead](rules/actions/pursue-a-lead-apg.md). The GM can add any relevant traits to this reaction depending on the situation, such as [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") and [linguistic](rules/traits/linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait") if you're conveying information verbally.
