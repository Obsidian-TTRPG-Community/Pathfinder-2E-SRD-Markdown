**Skill** [acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) (untrained)
- **Activity**: Single Action

You [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed. During this movement, you can try to move through the space of one enemy. Attempt an [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check against the enemy's Reflex DC as soon as you try to enter its space. You can [Tumble Through](rules/actions/tumble-through.md) using Climb, Fly, Swim, or another action instead of [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) in the appropriate environment.

> - **Success** You move through the enemy's space, treating the squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement). If you don't have enough Speed to move all the way through its space, you get the same effect as a failure.
> - **Failure** Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you had moved out of the square you started in.
