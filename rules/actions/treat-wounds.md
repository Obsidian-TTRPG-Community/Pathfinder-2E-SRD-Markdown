**Skill** [medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) (trained)
- **Requirements**: You are holding [healer's tools](compendium/equipment/items/healers-tools.md), or you are wearing them and have a hand free.
- **Activity**: 10 minute

You spend 10 minutes treating one injured living creature (targeting yourself, if you so choose). The target is then temporarily immune to Treat Wounds actions for 1 hour, but this interval overlaps with the time you spent treating (so a patient can be treated once per hour, not once per 70 minutes).

The [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check DC is usually 15, though the GM might adjust it based on the circumstances, such as treating a patient outside in a storm, or treating magically cursed wounds. If you're an expert in [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine), you can instead attempt a DC 20 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 10; if you're a master of [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine), you can instead attempt a DC 30 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 30; and if you're legendary, you can instead attempt a DC 40 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 50. The damage dealt on a critical failure remains the same.

If you succeed at your check, you can continue treating the target to grant additional healing. If you treat them for a total of 1 hour, double the Hit Points they regain from Treat Wounds.

The result of your [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check determines how many Hit Points the target regains.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target regains `4d8` Hit Points, and its wounded condition is removed.
> - **Success** The target regains `2d8` Hit Points, and its wounded condition is removed.
> - **Critical Failure** The target takes `1d8` damage
