**Variant Rule** Soulforged Armaments

You meditate, pray, or otherwise try to reinforce your soul's connection to your soulforged armament. This takes 10 minutes. Attempt a counteract check against your soulforged corruption. The counteract level is half your level rounded up, and the counteract check modifier is your [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) modifier. If successful, reduce the stage of your [soulforged corruption](compendium/gm/afflictions/soulforged-corruption-som.md) by 1 (to a minimum of Stage 1).
