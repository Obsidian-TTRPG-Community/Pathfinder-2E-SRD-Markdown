# Avoid Notice (basic)
[exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md "Exploration Action & Ability Trait")  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 479*  



You attempt a [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check to avoid notice while traveling at half speed. If you have the [Swift Sneak](compendium/feats/swift-sneak.md) feat, you can move at full Speed rather than half, but you still can't use another exploration activity while you do so. If you have the [Legendary Sneak](compendium/feats/legendary-sneak.md) feat, you can move at full Speed and use a second exploration activity. If you're Avoiding Notice at the start of an encounter, you usually roll a [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check instead of a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check both to determine your initiative and to see if the enemies notice you (based on their [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DCs, as normal for [Sneak](rules/actions/sneak.md), regardless of their initiative check results).
