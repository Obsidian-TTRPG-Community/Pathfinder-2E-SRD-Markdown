**Variant Rule** Vehicles
- **Requirements**: You are aboard the vehicle and adjacent to its controls.
- **Activity**: Single Action

You grab the reins, the wheel, or some other mechanism to control the vehicle. Attempt a piloting check; on a success, you become the vehicle's pilot, or regain control of the vehicle if it was uncontrolled. Some vehicles have complicated controls that cause this action to become a multi-action activity.
