# Scout the Facility
[downtime](rules/traits/downtime.md "Downtime Action & Ability Trait")  
*Source: Age of Ashes #5: Against the Scarlet Triad p. 24*  


The PC spends part of the day observing the Bhetshamtal Estate, recording patrols, noting escape routes, and creating a mental map.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The PC makes decisive observations that grant the PCs 1 Edge Point that can be used for sneaking through or navigating the estate.
> - **Failure** The PC learns nothing noteworthy.
> - **Critical Failure** The PC misjudges some element of the security. Inform the PCs that the scouting grants 1 Edge Point. When they use that Edge Point, they don't get the normal benefit, and if they rolled a normal failure they get a critical failure instead.
