# Unexpected Falcons
[exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md "Exploration Action & Ability Trait")  
*Source: Age of Ashes #5: Against the Scarlet Triad p. 26*  

- **Requirements**: The PCs got a critical failure while attempting to [Contact Steel Falcons](rules/actions/contact-steel-falcons-aoa5.md). This Complication can occur whenever the GM sees fit.

The Steel Falcons are performing their own heist to rescue their captain, Wallen Iuphasti, and they and the PCs encounter each other suddenly. Expecting trouble, the Steel Falcons have weapons drawn and are poised to attack. To overcome this encounter, the PCs quickly talk down the Andoren operatives.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Failure** The Steel Falcons become more vocal and threatening, and a brief fight breaks out. This increases the Awareness Point total by 3 (instead of the normal 1 for a failure).
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but increase Awareness by 5.
