- **Requirements**: A creature is [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by one or more of your allies but isn't [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by you.
- **Activity**: Single Action

You indicate a creature that you can see to one or more allies, gesturing in a direction and describing the distance verbally. That creature is [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) to your allies, rather than [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected). This works only for allies who can see you and are in a position where they could potentially detect the target. If your allies can't hear or understand you, they must succeed at a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check against the creature's [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) DC or they misunderstand and believe the target is in a different location.
