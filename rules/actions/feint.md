# Feint (basic) [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[mental](rules/traits/mental.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 246*  

**Skill** [deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) (trained)
- **Requirements**: You are within melee reach of the opponent you attempt to Feint.
- **Activity**: Single Action

With a misleading flourish, you leave an opponent unprepared for your real attack. Attempt a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check against that opponent's [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You throw your enemy's defenses against you entirely off. The target is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against melee attacks that you attempt against it until the end of your next turn.
> - **Success** Your foe is fooled, but only momentarily. The target is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the next melee attack that you attempt against it before the end of your current turn.
> - **Critical Failure** Your feint backfires. You are [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against melee attacks the target attempts against you until the end of your next turn.
