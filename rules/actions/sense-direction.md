# Sense Direction (basic)
[exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md "Exploration Action & Ability Trait")  [secret](rules/traits/secret.md "Secret General Trait")  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 252*  

**Skill** [survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) (untrained)

Using the stars, the position of the sun, traits of the geography or flora, or the behavior of fauna, you can stay oriented in the wild. Typically, you attempt a [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) check only once per day, but some environments or changes might necessitate rolling more often. The GM determines the DC and how long this activity takes (usually just a minute or so). More unusual locales or those you're unfamiliar with might require you to have a minimum proficiency rank to Sense Direction. Without a compass, you take a â€“2 item penalty to checks to Sense Direction.
