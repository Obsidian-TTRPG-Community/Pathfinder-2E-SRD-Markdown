*Source: Guns & Gears p. 108*  

**Class** gunslinger; **Subclass** Drifter
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a firearm or crossbow in one hand, and your other hand either wields a one-handed melee weapon or is empty.
- **Activity**: Single Action

You make a melee attack and then reload your gun in one fluid movement. [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) an opponent within reach with your one-handed melee weapon (or, if your other hand is empty, with an unarmed attack), and then [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to reload. You don't need a free hand to reload in this way.
