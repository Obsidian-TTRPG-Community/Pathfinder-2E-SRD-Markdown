**Skill** [intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) (untrained)
- **Activity**: Single Action

With a sudden shout, a well-timed taunt, or a cutting putdown, you can shake an enemy's resolve. Choose a creature within 30 feet of you who you're aware of. Attempt an [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check against that target's Will DC. If the target does not understand the language you are speaking, you're not speaking a language, or they can't hear you, you take a â€“4 circumstance penalty to the check. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your attempts to Demoralize it for 10 minutes.
