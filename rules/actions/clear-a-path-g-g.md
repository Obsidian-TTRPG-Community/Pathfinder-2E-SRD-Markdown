*Source: Guns & Gears p. 110*  

**Class** gunslinger; **Subclass** Vanguard
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a two-handed firearm or two-handed crossbow.
- **Activity**: Single Action

You push outward with your weapon to clear some space before quickly reloading a fresh round. You make an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) an opponent within your reach using your weapon, then [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to reload. For this [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md), you don't need a free hand, and you add the weapon's item bonus on attack rolls (if any) to the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check. If your last action was a ranged [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with the weapon, use the same multiple attack penalty as that [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) for the [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md); the [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) still counts toward your multiple attack penalty on further attacks as normal.
