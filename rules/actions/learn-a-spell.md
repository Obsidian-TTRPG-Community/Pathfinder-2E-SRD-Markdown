# Learn a Spell (basic)

*Source: Core Rulebook p. 238*  


- **Requirements**: You have a spellcasting class feature, and the spell you want to learn is on your magical tradition's spell list.

You can gain access to a new spell of your tradition from someone who knows that spell or from magical writing like a spellbook or scroll. If you can cast spells of multiple traditions, you can Learn a Spell of any of those traditions, but you must use the corresponding skill to do so. For example, if you were a cleric with the [bard multiclass archetype](compendium/character/archetypes/bard.md), you couldn't use [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) to add an occult spell to your bardic spell repertoire.

To learn the spell, you must do the following:

- Spend 1 hour per level of the spell, during which you must remain in conversation with a person who knows the spell or have the magical writing in your possession.
- Have materials with the Price indicated in [Table 4-3: Learning a Spell](rules/tables/learning-a-spell.md).
- Attempt a skill check for the skill corresponding to your tradition (DC determined by the GM, often close to the DC on [Table 4-3: Learning a Spell](rules/tables/learning-a-spell.md)). [Uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md) or [rare](rules/traits/rare.md) spells have [higher DCs](rules/tables/dc-adjustments.md); full guidelines for the GM appear on page 503.

If you have a spellbook, Learning a Spell lets you add the spell to your spellbook; if you prepare spells from a list, it's added to your list; if you have a spell repertoire, you can select it when you add or swap spells.
