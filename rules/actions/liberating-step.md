# Liberating Step [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 107*  

**Class** champion; **Subclass** Liberator
- **Trigger** An enemy damages, Grabs, or [Grapples](rules/actions/grapple.md) your ally, and both are within 15 feet of you.
- **Activity**: Reaction

You free an ally from restraint. If the trigger was an ally taking damage, the ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. The ally can attempt to break free of effects grabbing, restraining, immobilizing, or paralyzing them. They either attempt a new save against one such effect that allows a save, or attempt to [Escape](rules/actions/escape.md) from one effect as a free action. If they can move, the ally can Step as a free action, even if they didn't need to escape.
