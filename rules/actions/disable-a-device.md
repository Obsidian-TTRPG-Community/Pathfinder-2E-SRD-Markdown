**Skill** [thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) (trained)
- **Requirements**: Some devices require you to use [thieves' tools](compendium/equipment/items/thieves-tools.md) when disabling them.
- **Activity**: Two-Action

This action allows you to disarm a trap or another complex device. Often, a device requires numerous successes before becoming disabled, depending on its construction and complexity. Thieves' tools are helpful and sometimes even required to Disable a Device, as determined by the GM, and sometimes a device requires a higher proficiency rank in [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) to disable it.

Your [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check result determines how much progress you make.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You disable the device, or you achieve two successes toward disabling a complex device. You leave no trace of your tampering, and you can rearm the device later, if that type of device can be rearmed.
> - **Success** You disable the device, or you achieve one success toward disabling a complex device.
> - **Critical Failure** You trigger the device.
