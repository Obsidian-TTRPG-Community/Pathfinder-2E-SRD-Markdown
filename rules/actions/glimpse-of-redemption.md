**Class** champion; **Subclass** Redeemer
- **Trigger** An enemy damages your ally, and both are within 15 feet of you.
- **Activity**: Reaction

Your foe hesitates under the weight of sin as visions of redemption play in their mind's eye. The foe must choose one of the following options

- The ally is unharmed by the triggering damage.
- The ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. After the damaging effect is applied, the enemy becomes enfeebled 2 until the end of its next turn.
