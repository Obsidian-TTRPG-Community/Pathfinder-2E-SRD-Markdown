- **Requirements**: You have a [repair kit](compendium/equipment/items/repair-kit.md).

You spend 10 minutes attempting to fix a damaged item, placing the item on a stable surface and using the [repair kit](compendium/equipment/items/repair-kit.md) with both hands. The GM sets the DC, but it's usually about the same DC to Repair a given item as it is to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) it in the first place. You can't Repair a destroyed item.
