**Class** barbarian
- **Requirements**: You aren't [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) or raging.
- **Activity**: Single Action

You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), whichever comes first. You can't voluntarily stop raging. While you are raging:

- You deal 2 additional damage with melee weapons and unarmed attacks. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is [agile](rules/traits/agile.md).
- You take a â€“1 penalty to AC.
- You can't use actions with the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait unless they also have the [rage](rules/traits/rage.md) trait. You can [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) while raging.

After you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from [Rage](rules/actions/rage.md), and you can't [Rage](rules/actions/rage.md) again for 1 minute.
