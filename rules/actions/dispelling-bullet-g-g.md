**Class** gunslinger
**Archetype** [Spellshot](compendium/character/archetypes/spellshot-g-g.md)
- **Activity**: Two-Action

You imprint a bullet with a field of abjuration built upon your magical signature, disrupting the magic of whatever it hits. Make a firearm or crossbow [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) against a foe you can see. If you hit, you attempt to counteract a spell effect active on the target (your choice, or the highest-level effect if you don't choose). Your counteract level is equal to half your level (rounded up), and your counteract check modifier is equal to your class DC â€“ 10.
