# Sustain an Activation (basic) [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 534*  


- **Requirements**: You have at least one magic item activation that you can sustain and you are not fatigued.
- **Activity**: Single Action

Choose one magic item activation with a sustained duration you have in effect. The duration of that activation continues until the end of your next turn. Some activations may have slightly different or expanded effects if you sustain them. Sustaining an Activation for more than 10 minutes (100 rounds) ends the activation and makes you fatigued unless the item's description states a different maximum duration (such as "up to 1 minute" or "up to 1 hour").

If your Sustain an Activation action is disrupted, the item's effect immediately ends.
