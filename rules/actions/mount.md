- **Requirements**: You are adjacent to a creature that is at least one size larger than you and is willing to be your mount.
- **Activity**: Single Action

You move onto the creature and ride it. If you're already mounted, you can instead use this action to dismount, moving off the mount into a space adjacent to it.
