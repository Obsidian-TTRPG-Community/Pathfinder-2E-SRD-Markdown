# Breaking the Chains
[exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md "Exploration Action & Ability Trait")  
*Source: Age of Ashes #5: Against the Scarlet Triad p. 28*  

- **Requirements**: The PCs have overcome the other three Obstacles for this phase.

The captives are sealed behind bars and chained to the walls. The PCs undo these bindings as quietly as possible. Once the PCs defeat this Obstacle, they have freed Exavisu and one of her assistants and can begin Phase 4: Extraction. See the [That's Not Everyone](rules/actions/thats-not-everyone-aoa5.md) Complication for more options.
