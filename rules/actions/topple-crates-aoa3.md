# Topple Crates
[manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md)  
*Source: Age of Ashes #3: Tomorrow Must Burn p. 31*  

- **Requirements**: You are adjacent to a column of crates.

You attempt to topple a stack of heavy crates onto a foe. Attempt a DC 22 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** You topple the crates toward a target within a 15-foot line from the column. The falling crates deal `3d10+6` bludgeoning damage with a DC 26 basic Reflex save. A creature that critically fails is also knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone). Any squares where crates crashed down become difficult terrain.
> - **Failure** You are unable to topple the crates.
> - **Critical Failure** The crates topple onto you instead, with the same effects as a success but affecting only you and your square.
