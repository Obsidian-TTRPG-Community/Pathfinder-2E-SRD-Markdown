You [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) meticulously for hidden doors, concealed hazards, and so on. You can usually make an educated guess as to which locations are best to check and move at half speed, but if you want to be thorough and guarantee you checked everything, you need to travel at a Speed of no more than 300 feet per minute, or 150 feet per minute to ensure you check everything before you walk into it. You can always move more slowly while [Searching](rules/actions/search.md) to cover the area more thoroughly, and the [Expeditious Search](compendium/feats/expeditious-search.md) feat increases these maximum Speeds. If you come across a secret door, item, or hazard while [Searching](rules/actions/search.md), the GM will attempt a free secret check to [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) to see if you notice the hidden object or hazard. In locations with many objects to search, you have to stop and spend significantly longer to search thoroughly.
