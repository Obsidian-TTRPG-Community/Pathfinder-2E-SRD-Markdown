You envenom your fangs. If the next fangs [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) you make before the end of your turn hits and deals damage, the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) deals an additional `1d6` poison damage. On a critical failure, the poison is wasted as normal. At 12th level, this poison damage increases to `2d6`.
