**Skill** [athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) (untrained)
- **Requirements**: You have both hands free.
- **Activity**: Single Action

You move up, down, or across an incline. Unless it's particularly easy, you must attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check. The GM determines the DC based on the nature of the incline and environmental circumstances. You're [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) unless you have a climb Speed.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You move up, across, or safely down the incline for 5 feet plus 5 feet per 20 feet of your land Speed (a total of 10 feet for most PCs).
> - **Success** You move up, across, or safely down the incline for 5 feet per 20 feet of your land Speed (a total of 5 feet for most PCs, minimum 5 feet if your Speed is below 20 feet).
> - **Critical Failure** You fall. If you began the climb on stable ground, you fall and land [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
