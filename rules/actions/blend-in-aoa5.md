Sometimes the best option for crossing a crowded party is to act natural and join the crowd.

If a PC successfully Blends In, roll a secret DC 34 [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check for them to notice that something seems off about one of the guests. On a success, inform them about the [Dispel a Disguise](rules/actions/dispel-a-disguise-aoa5.md) Opportunity.
