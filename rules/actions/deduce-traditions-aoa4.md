By interpreting a regent's personality, drawing upon what you know about dwarven tradition, and making educated guesses, you surmise what sorts of skills are most valued by the dwarven regent's guildâ€”and thus infer what types of skills would most likely curry that regent's favor. Deduce Traditions requires a successful DC 30 [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check or a successful DC 25 [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) check to yield accurate results.
