- **Trigger**: The target of your [Exploit Vulnerability](rules/actions/exploit-vulnerability-da.md) makes a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or [Casts a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that would affect you or one of your allies.
- **Requirements**: You are holding your First Implement and Esoterica|Thaumaturge|DA|bell|DA|1||bell implement, and the triggering creature is within 30 feet of you.
- **Activity**: Reaction

First Implement and Esoterica|Thaumaturge|DA|Your|DA|1||Your implement sings out abruptly, disrupting your foe. The piece played depends on whether the trigger was a Strike or Spell, and it applies to the triggering Strike or Spell, except where noted otherwise.

- **Distracting Cacophony.** The trigger is a spell. You create a musical crash of sonic energy that assails the target and breaks its concentration. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or become [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) until the end of your next turn ([stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) on a critical failure). The target doesn't have to attempt a flat check to avoid losing the triggering spell, but the discordant ring does lower the spell attack roll or spell DC of the triggering spell from [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied).
- **Disrupting Harmony.** The trigger is a Strike. You create a strangely discordant harmony that sinks into your foe's mind and throws its movements off. The target must succeed at a Will save against your class DC or become your choice of [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) or [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) until the end of your next turn ([enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) or [clumsy](rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) on a critical failure).
