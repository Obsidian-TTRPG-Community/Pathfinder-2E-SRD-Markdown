# Upgrade Defenses
[downtime](rules/traits/downtime.md "Downtime Action & Ability Trait")  [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  
*Source: Age of Ashes #2: Cult of Cinders p. 73*  

- **Requirements**: [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) (master), Specialty Crafting (stonemasonry), or hired stonemason; organized specialists

You bolster Citadel Altaerein's walls with metal braces, skillful engineering, and other supports. This upgrade takes 40 days of work and a DC 25 [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check.

**GM Note:** The effects of this upgrade come into play when Citadel Altaerein is attacked in the final adventure of Age of Ashes, but until then these upgraded defenses are largely cosmetic. (If you add additional encounters in which the castle is attacked during the next few adventures, be sure to keep any upgraded defenses in mind.)
