# Cram
[downtime](rules/traits/downtime.md)  
*Source: Strength of Thousands #1: Kindled Magic p. 63*  

- **Requirements**: You are an initiate, attendant, or conversant, and your branch level for either your primary or secondary branch is 2 or more levels below the limit.

Realizing that you're falling behind in your studies, you cram more than you probably should. You Study twice, each in a branch that satisfies the activity requirements. However, the extra studying comes at a price. Until the next time you take the Study downtime activity, you're particularly tired from all the extra hours cramming; at the start of each day of adventuring, you must succeed at a DC 8 flat check or be [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) for that day.
