# Borrow an Arcane Spell (basic)
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md "Exploration Action & Ability Trait")  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 241*  

**Skill** [arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) (trained)

If you're an arcane spellcaster who prepares from a spellbook, you can attempt to prepare a spell from someone else's spellbook. The GM sets the DC for the check based on the spell's level and rarity; it's typically a bit easier than [Learning the Spell](rules/actions/learn-a-spell.md).

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** You prepare the borrowed spell as part of your normal spell preparation.
> - **Failure** You fail to prepare the spell, but the spell slot remains available for you to prepare a different spell. You can't try to prepare this spell until the next time you prepare spells.
