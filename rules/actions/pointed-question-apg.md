You ask a question that charms or needles someone in just the right way. Ask a question of a non-allied creature that you can see and have been conversing with. Attempt a [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check against the creature's Will DC. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

> - **Critical Success** The target must directly answer your question. It doesn't have to answer truthfully, but you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC if the creature attempts to [Lie](rules/actions/lie.md) to you.
> - **Success** As critical success, but the circumstance bonus is +2.
> - **Failure** The target can refuse to answer you as normal.
> - **Critical Failure** The target can refuse to answer you as normal, and its attitude toward you decreases by one step due to your aggravating attention.
