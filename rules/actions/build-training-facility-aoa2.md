- **Requirements**: expert in the skill listed below or hired trainer; organized specialists

Pick a room in Citadel Altaerein to serve as a training area for a single character class (you can have multiple training facilities, with each one devoted to a different class). Once complete, the training facility fills the role of a teacher when using the Retrain downtime activity for the chosen class, and reduces the time required to retrain a feat or skill increase by 2 days and the time required to retrain a class feature by 1 week. This upgrade takes 40 days of work.

Building the facility requires a DC 25 skill check using a skill depending on the class in question, as listed below. If a class lists multiple skills, the PC can choose whichever one they like (but they must be an expert in the chosen skill, as noted in the Requirements entry above).

**Alchemist** Crafting

**Barbarian** Athletics

**Bard** Occultism or Performance

**Champion** Religion

**Cleric** Religion

**Druid** Nature

**Fighter** Acrobatics or Athletics

**Monk** Acrobatics or Athletics

**Ranger** Athletics, Nature, or Survival

**Rogue** Acrobatics or Thievery

**Sorcerer** Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion

**Wizard** Arcana
