# Detect Magic (basic)
[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md "Exploration Action & Ability Trait")  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 479*  



You cast [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) at regular intervals. You move at half your travel speed or slower. You have no chance of accidentally overlooking a magic aura at a travel speed up to 300 feet per minute, but must be traveling no more than 150 feet per minute to detect magic auras before the party moves into them.
