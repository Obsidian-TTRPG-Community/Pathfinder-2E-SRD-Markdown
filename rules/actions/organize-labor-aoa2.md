You spend a day in Breachill recruiting workers to aid in a repair or an upgrade at Citadel Altaerein. Attempt a DC 13 [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), or [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check to Organize Labor to organize workers, or a DC 18 check for specialists.

If you use [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) for this check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, but failure comes with extra risks, as detailed below. Using [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) grants no bonus to the check, but comes without added risk. When you Organize Labor, you must specify one repair or upgrade activity to be undertaken; once you successfully Organize Labor, you must begin that activity within a week.

A force of organized workers costs 1 gp per day, while a force of organized specialists costs 5 gp per day.

This penalty increases with each subsequent failure, to a maximum penalty of –4.
