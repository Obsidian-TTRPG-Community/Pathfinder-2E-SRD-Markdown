# Wicked Thorns [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
*Source: Lost Omens: Impossible Lands p. 37*  

**Ancestry** Ghoran; **Heritage** Ghoran|LOIL|Thorned|Thorned|LOIL|
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You're hit with an unarmed [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) or a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with a non-reach melee weapon.
- **Activity**: Reaction

Several of your thorns break off and hook into your attacker's body. You deal `1d8` piercing damage to the triggering creature. It attempts a basic Reflex save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. On a critical failure, the creature also takes `1d4` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) as your thorns embed in its flesh. At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1d8, and the persistent piercing damage increases by 1.
