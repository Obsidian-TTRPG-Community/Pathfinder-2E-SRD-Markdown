- **Trigger**: You attempt a saving throw against a [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait") effect, but you haven't rolled yet.
- **Activity**: Reaction

You rise above the triggering effect, refusing to be harmed by it. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw and to any other saving throws you attempt against [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait") effects until the start of your next turn.
