- **Requirements**: This is your first action in a gladiatorial match, or you've damaged or visibly impeded a foe while fighting a gladiatorial match.

With a mocking gesture, a triumphant flourish, or a bold challenge, you inspire the crowd to cheer you on. Attempt an [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics), [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics), [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation), or [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check, with a DC typically set by the encounter's level. Crowds grow bored with repetition though; and attempting to Pander to the Crowd using the same skill that was used the last time someone used this action imposes a â€“2 circumstance penalty on the check. If you critically succeeded at an attack roll this turn, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Pander to the Crowd attempt.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The crowd goes wild! You can either give yourself a +3 status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the end of your next turn, or give yourself and all your allies a +2 status bonus to the same rolls until the end of your next turn.
> - **Success** You appeal to the crowd. As critical success, but the bonus is +2 just for you, or +1 for you and your allies.
> - **Failure** You don't make an impression.
> - **Critical Failure** Your pandering is laughable, and the crowd begins to favor your opponents. The next creature hostile to you that attempts to Pander to the Crowd gains a +4 circumstance bonus to the check.
