*Source: Guns & Gears p. 109*  

**Class** gunslinger; **Subclass** Sniper
- **Activity**: Single Action

You duck into a safe position or minimize your profile while reloading to make your next attack. Either [Take Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md) or attempt to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md), then [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) to reload. As normal, you must meet the requirements to [Take Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md) or [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md); you must be [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone), benefiting from cover, or near a feature that allows you to [Take Cover](rules/actions/take-cover.md), and you need to be benefiting from cover or [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to a creature to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) from that creature.
