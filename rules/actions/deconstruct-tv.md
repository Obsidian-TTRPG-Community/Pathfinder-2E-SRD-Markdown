# Deconstruct
[downtime](rules/traits/downtime.md "Downtime Action & Ability Trait")  [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  
*Source: Treasure Vault p. 162*  


You deconstruct an item to provide the starting point to convert it into a new item. You need the [Alchemical Crafting](compendium/feats/alchemical-crafting.md) skill feat to deconstruct alchemical items and the [Magical Crafting](compendium/feats/magical-crafting.md) skill feat to deconstruct magic items.

To Deconstruct an item, you must meet the following requirements.

- The item is your level or lower. An item that doesn't list a level is level 0. If the item is 9th level or higher, you must be a master in Crafting, and if it's 16th or higher, you must be legendary. 
- The item isn't a cursed item, artifact, or other item that is similarly hard to destroy. The item isn't a consumable item. 
- The item has a listed Price. 
- You must have an appropriate set of tools and, in many cases, a workshop. For example, you need access to a smithy to deconstruct a metal shield or an alchemist's lab to de-concoct alchemical items.

At the start of this process, you must decide if you're using the deconstructed item to build a new, similar item, of if you are simply breaking it down for raw ingredients that can be used at a later date for any item. In either case, this activity takes 1 day to perform, but if you're using the item to create a new, similar item, that day can be counted as one of the crafting days for the new item.

At the end of the activity, you must attempt a Crafting check. The GM sets the DC of this check based on the level of the item you are attempting to deconstruct, its rarity, and other circumstances.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** If you are deconstructing the item to make a new, similar item, you can apply 80% of the cost of the deconstructed item to the new item. If you are deconstructing the item for raw materials alone, you can apply 55% of the cost of the deconstructed item to a single new item. In either case, if this is in excess of the new item's cost, the remainder is lost. 
> - **Success** As critical success, but you can only apply 75% of the deconstructed item's cost to the new similar item and 50% of the deconstructed item's cost to any single item. 
> - **Failure** You fail to deconstruct the item, wasting your time. You can try again. 
> - **Critical Failure** You fail to deconstruct the item and damage it in the process. You must either repair it before attempting again, or you can attempt to deconstruct it again but lose 5% of the value of the item.
