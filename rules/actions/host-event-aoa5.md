*Source: Age of Ashes #5: Against the Scarlet Triad p. 18*  


You dedicate a day to planning and hosting a special event, such as a feast, a small festival, or a public performance. Doing so requires an expenditure of 250 gp. Attempt a DC 36 [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance), [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society), or appropriate [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check. The result determines the impact of your efforts. You gain a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus to this check (maximum +4) for each additional 250 gp you spend on the event.
