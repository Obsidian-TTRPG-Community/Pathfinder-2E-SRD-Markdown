# Sense Weakness [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
*Source: Gamemastery Guide p. 167*  

**Variant Rule** Duels
- **Trigger**: You attempt a melee Strike against your opponent, but haven't rolled yet.
- **Requirements**: You're in a duel, you're trained in [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception), and you rolled a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check for initiative this round.
- **Activity**: Reaction

You pick a precise moment to attack, giving you an edge. Your opponent is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the attack. If your opponent is using [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) for initiative when this ability is used, they are instead [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of their next turn.
