# Force Open (basic) [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[attack](rules/traits/attack.md "Attack Combat Trait")  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 242*  

**Skill** [athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) (untrained)
- **Activity**: Single Action

Using your body, a lever, or some other tool, you attempt to forcefully open a door, window, container or heavy gate. With a high enough result, you can even smash through walls. Without a [crowbar](compendium/equipment/items/crowbar.md), prying something open takes a –2 item penalty to the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to Force Open.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You open the door, window, container, or gate and can avoid damaging it in the process.
> - **Success** You break the door, window, container, or gate open, and the door, window, container, or gate gains the [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) condition. If it's especially sturdy, the GM might have it take damage but not be broken.
> - **Critical Failure** Your attempt jams the door, window, container, or gate shut, imposing a –2 circumstance penalty on future attempts to Force it Open.
