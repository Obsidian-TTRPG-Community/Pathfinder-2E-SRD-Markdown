*Source: Age of Ashes #5: Against the Scarlet Triad p. 27*  

- **Requirements**: When Blending In or using a [Cunning Disguise](rules/actions/cunning-disguise-aoa5.md), a PC has noticed something is off about a guest.

The PC is sure there's more to Baroness Epminia Fahlspar than meets the eye. They're right—she's Reloon, a rakshasa in disguise!

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The PC sees through the disguise and identifies a way to unveil the rakshasa without magic. Rakshasas are not unwelcome here, but the sudden reveal of Reloon's natural form and her dismayed outburst draws the attention of many partyers. Reduce Awareness by 2 (minimum 0).
> - **Success** The PC senses the magical disguise. To overcome this Opportunity, a PC must either magically counteract the disguise or succeed at a DC 40 [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) or [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) check to cause the baroness's concentration to waver, briefly disrupting her disguise. This reveals her, as described under critical success.
> - **Failure** The PC sees no evidence of a disguise.
> - **Critical Failure** The PC sees no evidence of a disguise, and their scrutiny invites a loud dressing down by the baroness.
