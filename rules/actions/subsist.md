# Subsist (basic)
[downtime](rules/traits/downtime.md "Downtime Action & Ability Trait")  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 240*  



You try to provide food and shelter for yourself, and possibly others as well, with a standard of living as described [here](rules/tables/cost-of-living.md). The GM determines the DC based on the nature of the place where you're trying to Subsist. You might need a minimum proficiency rank to Subsist in particularly strange environments. Unlike most downtime activities, you can Subsist after 8 hours or less of exploration, but if you do, you take a â€“5 penalty

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You either provide a subsistence living for yourself and one additional creature, or you improve your own food and shelter, granting yourself a comfortable living.
> - **Success** You find enough food and shelter with basic protection from the elements to provide you a subsistence living.
> - **Failure** You're exposed to the elements and don't get enough food, becoming fatigued until you attain sufficient food and shelter.
> - **Critical Failure** You attract trouble, eat something you shouldn't, or otherwise worsen your situation. You take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to checks to Subsist for 1 week. You don't find any food at all; if you don't have any stored up, you're in danger of starving or dying of thirst if you continue failing.

The following skills can be used to Recall Knowledge, getting information about the listed topics. In some cases, you can get the GM's permission to use a different but related skill, usually against a higher DC than normal. Some topics might appear on multiple lists, but the skills could give different information. For example, [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) might tell you about the magical defenses of a golem, whereas [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) could tell you about its sturdy resistance to physical attacks.
