# Hunt the Animals
[exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md "Exploration Action & Ability Trait")  
*Source: Age of Ashes #2: Cult of Cinders p. 20*  


When the hunt begins, the Ekujae elves and the PCs work together to bring down the game. Against an impressive find, each PC actively participating (and not just [Aiding](rules/actions/aid.md)) attempts a DC 25 [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) check. Against standard game, the DC is 20. No check is needed to hunt river turtles or bats—hunting such game is automatically successful (but can never be a critical success).

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You help take down the animals quickly and relatively painlessly, showing them mercy.
> - **Success** Your participation in the hunt helps the hunting party take down the animals quickly.
> - **Failure** Your involvement complicates the hunt—one or two animals even escape uninjured. Each PC takes `2d6` damage from animal attacks (or `4d6` if the animals were an impressive find).
> - **Critical Failure** Several of the animals die poorly, and many escape with mortal wounds. Barely enough animals are caught for the feast, but the fact that they died in pain or escaped with injuries shames the Ekujae— the party loses 2 IP. Each PC takes `2d6+6` damage from animal attacks (or `4d6+12` if the animals were an impressive find).
