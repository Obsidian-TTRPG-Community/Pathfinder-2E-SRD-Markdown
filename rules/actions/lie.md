**Skill** [deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) (untrained)
- **Activity**: 1 round (at least 1 Round)

You try to fool someone with an untruth. Doing so takes at least 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate. You roll a single [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check and compare it against the [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC of every creature you are trying to fool. The GM might give them a circumstance bonus based on the situation and the nature of the lie you are trying to tell. Elaborate or highly unbelievable lies are much harder to get a creature to believe than simpler and more believable lies, and some lies are so big that it's impossible to get anyone to believe them.

At the GM's discretion, if a creature initially believes your lie, it might attempt a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check later to Sense Motive against your [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) DC to realize it's a lie. This usually happens if the creature discovers enough evidence to counter your statements.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target believes your lie.
> - **Failure** The target doesn't believe your lie and gains a +4 circumstance bonus against your attempts to Lie for the duration of your conversation. The target is also more likely to be suspicious of you in the future.
