*Source: Age of Ashes #5: Against the Scarlet Triad p. 27*  

- **Requirements**: The PC has successfully infiltrated the estate.

Now that they're on the inside, the PC helps an ally who's still trying to infiltrate. They describe what they're doing to help, and give the ally the benefits of Following the Expert. The GM might require the PC to attempt a relevant skill check (typically DC 32) to Smooth the Path.
