You take 10 minutes to investigate a specific room in the Golden Citadel to learn any information about it. Guards won't normally be annoyed by this if you investigate a public area, but if they see you investigating a private area they will attempt to escort you out before you can complete the investigation. Attempt a DC 36 [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) check to determine your level of success.

> - **Critical Success** You learn the room's read-aloud text, basic information, and any secret information.
> - **Success** You learn the room's read-aloud text and basic information.
> - **Failure** You fail to learn anything about the room other than its read-aloud text.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure above, but any guards who can observe you notice suspicious activity and attempt to escort you out of the area, either to the council chamber (area **C1**) or out of the building entirely.
