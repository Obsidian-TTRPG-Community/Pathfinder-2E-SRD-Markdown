# Diviner on Duty
[exploration](rules/traits/exploration.md "Exploration Action & Ability Trait")  
*Source: Age of Ashes #5: Against the Scarlet Triad p. 28*  

- **Trigger**: A PC uses magic to aid in overcoming an Obstacle during infiltration.

Among the Scarlet Triad's security is a highly competent diviner! With spells such as [discern lies](compendium/spells/discern-lies.md), [mind reading](compendium/spells/mind-reading.md), [see invisibility](compendium/spells/see-invisibility.md), and [true seeing](compendium/spells/true-seeing.md), this diviner can see through most magical schemes the PCs might use.

The diviner is watching for magical threats, not poison. With a successful DC 33 [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery), or food-related [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check, a PC can trick her into consuming something laden with an ingested poison. Her Fortitude save bonus is +23, and she withdraws if successfully poisoned. If not successfully poisoned, increase the PCs' Awareness Points by 2.
