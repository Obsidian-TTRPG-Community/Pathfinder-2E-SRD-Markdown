- **Trigger**: The PCs complete Break the Chains

The enslaved members of the Jewelers' Guild were not all kept in one place. If the PCs intend to rescue all three assistants and Benneb, the missing antiquities dealer from Finderplain, they need to repeat either the Break the Chains or [Locked Doors](rules/actions/locked-doors-aoa5.md) Obstacle a second time. The PCs can skip this Complication, but doing so impacts their rewards (page 30).
