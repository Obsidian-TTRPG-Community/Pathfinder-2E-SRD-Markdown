# Build Connections
[downtime](rules/traits/downtime.md "Downtime Action & Ability Trait")  
*Source: Age of Ashes #5: Against the Scarlet Triad p. 18*  


You dedicate a day to making friends in high places, typically by inviting yourself to parties, performing small favors to be repaid later, and generally projecting an aura of confidence and capability. Attempt a DC 36 [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting), [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy), [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance), or appropriate [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check. The result determines the impact of your efforts. If you have the [Connections](compendium/feats/connections.md) skill feat and roll a success, you get a critical success instead.

> - **Critical Success** For 1 month, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your skill checks to pursue the downtime activities listed here. You also earn a single favor that you can call in when you or an ally you're working with attempts a skill check for one of these downtime actions. That creature can roll twice and use the better result, after which the favor is considered repaid; calling in the favor is a fortune effect.
> - **Success** For 1 week, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your skill checks for the downtime activities listed here.
> - **Critical Failure** A faux pas embarrasses you, and rumors recount the incident widely. For 3 days, you take a â€“1 circumstance penalty to skill checks for the downtime activities listed here.
