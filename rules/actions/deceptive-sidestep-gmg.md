*Source: Gamemastery Guide p. 167*  

**Variant Rule** Duels
- **Trigger** An opponent hits, but does not critically hit you, with a melee Strike.
- **Requirements**: You're in a duel, you're trained in [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception), and you rolled a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check for initiative this round.
- **Activity**: Reaction

You draw your enemy in and pull away at the last moment. The triggering opponent must roll again and take the second result. If your opponent is using [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) for initiative when this ability is used, they also take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to the second attack roll.
