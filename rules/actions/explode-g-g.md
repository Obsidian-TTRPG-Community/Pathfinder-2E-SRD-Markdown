**Class** inventor
- **Activity**: Two-Action

You intentionally take your innovation beyond normal safety limits, making it explode and damage nearby creatures without damaging the innovation... hopefully. The explosion deals `2d6` fire damage with a basic Reflex save to all creatures in a 5-foot emanation around you (if you're wearing or holding the innovation) or around your innovation (if your innovation is a minion).

At 3rd level, and every level thereafter, increase your explosion's damage by 1d6.

If you have the breakthrough innovation class feature, you can choose either a 5-foot or 10-foot emanation for the area when you use Explode; if you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, you can choose a 5-foot, 10-foot, or 15-foot emanation.
