You attempt to gain favor with one of Kovlar's regents, either by responding to their question with tact and respect and attempting a Diplomacy check, or by drawing upon your acumen in another skill. This second tactic usually can't succeed unless that skill is one favored by that regent's guild. At the GM's option, you may substitute an applicable [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill check for the [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) check. If you attempt a [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) or [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check, it's a DC 32 check for success; if you attempt a favored skill check, it's a DC 28 check for success.

At the GM's option, a player who brings up a compelling point or roleplays particularly well in their attempt to Influence a Regent might gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.
