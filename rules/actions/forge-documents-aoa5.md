The PC prepares several forgeries that might serve as convincing props during the heist.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The PC creates convincing documents that grant the PCs 1 Edge Point they can use when presenting proper credentials, work orders, or invitations.
> - **Failure** The PC creates somewhat unconvincing documents. Inform the PCs the forgeries grant 1 Edge Point. However, when they use that Edge Point, it grants no benefit.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but a PC who uses the Edge Point on a failure gets a critical failure instead.
