# Corrupting Gaze [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

The ghost stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target takes `1d6` negative damage + `1d6` per 2 levels with a basic Will save. A creature that fails its save is also [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 minute.
