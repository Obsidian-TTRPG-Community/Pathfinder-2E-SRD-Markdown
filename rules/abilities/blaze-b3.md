# Blaze

The skeleton is wreathed with fire, which doesn't consume its bones or gear. The skeleton gains immunity to fire and weakness 5 to cold, loses its resistance to cold, and its [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) deal additional [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to half the skeleton's level (minimum 1 damage).
