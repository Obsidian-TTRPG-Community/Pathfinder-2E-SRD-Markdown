# Greater Constrict [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

- **Activate**: Single Action

The monster deals the listed amount of damage to any number of creatures [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by it. Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save with the listed DC. A creature that fails this save falls [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), and a creature that succeeds is then temporarily immune to falling [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) from Greater Constrict for 1 minute.
