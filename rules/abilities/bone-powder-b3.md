# Bone Powder

When the skeleton takes physical damage from a critical hit, one of its bones is pulverized into a fine powder. All creatures in a 5-foot emanation that breathe take `1d6` [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) (plus an additional `1d6` for every 6 levels the skeleton has).
