# Regeneration

This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition never increases beyond [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying) as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to [dying](rules/conditions.md#Dying).
