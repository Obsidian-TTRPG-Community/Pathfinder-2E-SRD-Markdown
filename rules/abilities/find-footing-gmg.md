- **Activate**: Single Action

The NPC attempts an [Architecture Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), [Engineering Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), or similar skill check to find a stable path across uneven ground. This grants them and anyone they share this information with a +2 circumstance bonus on [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) checks to [Balance](rules/actions/balance.md) across that ground.
