# Telepathy
[aura](rules/traits/aura.md)  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md)  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

A monster with [telepathy](compendium/spells/telepathy.md) can communicate mentally with any creatures within the listed radius, as long as they share a language. This doesn't give any special access to their thoughts, and communicates no more information than normal speech would.
