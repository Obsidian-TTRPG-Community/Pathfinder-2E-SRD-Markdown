# Telepathy
[aura](rules/traits/aura.md "Aura Combat Trait")  [divination](rules/traits/divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  


A monster with [telepathy](compendium/spells/telepathy.md) can communicate mentally with any creatures within the listed radius, as long as they share a language. This doesn't give any special access to their thoughts, and communicates no more information than normal speech would.
