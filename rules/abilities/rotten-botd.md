# Rotten

The bones of this skeleton are black and rotten, having spent years in polluted water or some other foul substance. The skeleton loses its resistance to piercing and slashing damage and is surrounded by a horrific stench in a 10-foot aura. A creature entering or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save against the standard DC of the skeleton's level or become [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) (plus [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) for as long as it remains [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) on a critical failure). While within the aura, affected creatures take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.

This stench remains for 1 hour after the rotten skeleton has been destroyed unless the bones are burned, or the rot is washed away with at least 1 gallon of water.
