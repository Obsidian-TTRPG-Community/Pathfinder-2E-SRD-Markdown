# Malevolent Possession [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

- **Activate**: Two-Action

The ghost attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the [possession](compendium/spells/possession.md) spell, except since the ghost doesn't have a physical body, it is unaffected by that restriction of the spell.
