# Inhabit Object [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

- **Activate**: Single Action

The ghost possesses an object of size [Large](rules/traits/large-b1.md "Large Size Trait") or smaller within 20 feet, making it an animated object (pages 20–21). This animated object's level can be no higher than the ghost's level – 2. If the target object is being held by a creature, the bearer can attempt a Will save to prevent the possession. This possession ends when the object is destroyed or the ghost leaves it. At this point, the ghost reappears in the object's square and can't Inhabit an Object again for `1d4` rounds.
