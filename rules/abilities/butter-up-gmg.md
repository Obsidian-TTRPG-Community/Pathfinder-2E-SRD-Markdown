# Butter Up
[emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  


When someone eats a dish or treat made by this NPC, the NPC can attempt a [Baking Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), [Cooking Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore), or similar check against that creature's Will DC, with the same results as the [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) action of [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy). If more than one creature partakes, the NPC uses the same check result against each creature's Will DC.
