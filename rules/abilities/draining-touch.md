# Draining Touch [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

With a touch, the ghost attempts to drain a living creature's life force. It makes a ghostly hand [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) but deals no damage on a hit. Instead, the target becomes [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) for 1 day, and the ghost regains HP equal to half its own level.
