The ghost laments its fate, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) (or [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost's frightful moan for 1 minute.
