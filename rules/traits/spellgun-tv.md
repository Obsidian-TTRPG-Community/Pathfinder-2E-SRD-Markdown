# Spellgun  
*Source: Treasure Vault p. 221*  

The spellgun trait appears on items that can generate a magical effect that flies out like a bullet. You can make either a spell attack roll with a spellgun or a ranged attack roll using your proficiency with simple firearms. Spellguns have a range increment, which applies regardless of which type of attack roll you make. Though you can use your modifier for simple firearms, a spellgun isn't actually a firearm. You don't get the damage of a firearm [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), nor other benefits like critical specialization. Similarly, you can't load or reload a spellgun, [affix talismans](rules/actions/affix-a-talisman.md) to one, make a spellgun [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) as part of an action that lets you make a firearm [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), and so on.
