# Water  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 638*  

Effects with the water trait either manipulate or conjure water. Those that manipulate water have no effect in an area without water. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of water or have a magical connection to the element.

These planes are mostly liquid. Visitors who can't breathe water or reach an air pocket likely drown. Water magic is enhanced, and [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait") magic is impeded. Creatures with a weakness to water take damage equal to double their weakness at the end of each round.
