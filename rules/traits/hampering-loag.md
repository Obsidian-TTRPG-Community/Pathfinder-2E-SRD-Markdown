# Hampering  
*Source: Lost Omens: Ancestry Guide p. 139*  

A weapon with the hampering trait is designed to be shaken, cast outward, or whipped about to control space on the battlefield. You can use an Interact action to thrash the weapon in a square within the weapon's reach. That square becomes difficult terrain until you attack with the weapon, move, or would otherwise stop intentionally thrashing it.
