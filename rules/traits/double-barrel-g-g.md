# Double Barrel  
*Source: Guns & Gears p. 232*  

This weapon has two barrels that are each loaded separately. You can fire both barrels of a double barrel weapon in a single [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) to increase the weapon damage die by one step. If the weapon has the [fatal](rules/traits/fatal.md "Fatal Weapon Trait") trait, this increases the fatal die by one step.
