# Composition  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 629*  

To cast a composition cantrip or focus spell, you usually use a type of [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance). If the spell includes a verbal component, you must use an [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") performance, and if it includes a somatic component, you must use a [visual](rules/traits/visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") one. The spell gains all the traits of the performance you used. You can cast only one composition spell each turn, and you can have only one active at a time. If you cast a new composition spell, any ongoing effects from your previous composition spell end immediately.
