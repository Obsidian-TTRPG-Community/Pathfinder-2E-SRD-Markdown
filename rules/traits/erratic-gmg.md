# Erratic  
*Source: Gamemastery Guide p. 251*  

Time slows down and speeds up, so an individual may lose or gain time as they move between planes. When a creature moves from a plane with erratic time to one with normal time, roll a DC 11 flat check. Creatures that leave an erratic time plane together share the same result.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** Time passed normally on the erratic time plane.
> - **Failure** For each hour spent on the erratic time plane, 1 day passed on the normal time plane.
> - **Critical Failure** For each round spent on the erratic time plane, 1 day passed on the normal time plane.
