# Bomb  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 629*  

An alchemical bomb combines volatile alchemical components that explode when the bomb hits a creature or object. Most alchemical bombs deal damage, though some produce other effects.

Bombs are martial [thrown](rules/traits/thrown.md "Thrown Weapon Trait") weapons with a range increment of 20 feet. When you throw a bomb, you make a weapon attack roll against the target's AC, as you would for any other weapon. It takes one hand to draw, prepare, and throw a bomb. Due to the complexity involved in preparing bombs, [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) to throw alchemical bombs gain the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") trait. The bomb is activated when thrown as a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)â€”you don't have to activate it separately.
