# Construct  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 630*  

A construct is an artificial creature empowered by a force other than necromancy. Constructs are often [mindless](rules/traits/mindless.md); they are immune to disease, the [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) condition, and poison; and they may have Hardness based on the materials used to construct their bodies. Constructs are not living creatures, nor are they undead. When reduced to 0 Hit Points, a construct creature is destroyed.
