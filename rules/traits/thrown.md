# Thrown  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 283*  

You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack; it is a ranged weapon when thrown. You add your Strength modifier to damage as you would for a melee weapon. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment in the weapon's Range entry.
