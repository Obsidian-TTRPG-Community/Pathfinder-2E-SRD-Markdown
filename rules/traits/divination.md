# Divination  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 631*  

The divination school of magic typically involves obtaining or transferring information, or predicting events.

Divinations allow you to learn the secrets of the present, past, and future. They bestow good fortune, grant you the ability to perceive remote locations, and reveal secret knowledge.

Divinations often have the detection trait if they find something, the [prediction](rules/traits/prediction.md "Prediction Effect Trait") trait if they grant you insight about what might happen in the future, the [revelation](rules/traits/revelation.md "Revelation Effect Trait") trait if they show things as they truly are, or the [scrying](rules/traits/scrying.md "Scrying Effect Trait") trait if they let you perceive another location.
