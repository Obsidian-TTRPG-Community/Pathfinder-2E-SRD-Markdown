# Processed  
*Source: Treasure Vault p. 46*  

An alchemical consumable with the processed trait can be created with [Quick Alchemy](rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md) but is too complex to create in a single action. Using [Quick Alchemy](rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md) to create a processed item takes 1 minute. If the item would take more than 3 actions to Activate, the time the item remains potent after you create it is equal to its activation time. For instance, a processed item that takes 10 minutes to Activate would remain potent for 10 minutes when created with [Quick Alchemy](rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md) instead of remaining potent only until the start of your next turn. This trait doesn't change other specifics of [Quick Alchemy](rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md). You could, for example, use double brew to create two of the same processed item over the course of 1 minute.
