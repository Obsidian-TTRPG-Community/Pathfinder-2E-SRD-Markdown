# Evocation  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 634*  

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the evocation school of magic, typically involving energy and elemental forces.

Evocations capture magical energy and then shape it to harm your foes or protect your allies. Evocation spells often have a trait that comes from the type of damage they deal, such as [acid](rules/traits/acid.md "Acid Energy & Element Trait"), [cold](rules/traits/cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait"), [fire](rules/traits/fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait"), [force](rules/traits/force.md "Force Energy & Element Trait"), or [sonic](rules/traits/sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait").
