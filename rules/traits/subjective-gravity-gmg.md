# Subjective Gravity  
*Source: Gamemastery Guide p. 254*  

All bodies of mass can be centers of gravity with the same force, but only if a non-mindless creature wills it. Unattended items, objects, and [mindless](rules/traits/mindless.md "Mindless Creature Trait") creatures treat the plane as having microgravity. Creatures on a plane with subjective gravity can move normally along a solid surface by imagining "down" near their feet. Designating this downward direction is a free action that has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait. If suspended in midair, a creature can replicate flight by choosing a "down" direction and falling in that direction, moving up to their Speed or fly Speed. This pseudo-flight uses the [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md) action.
