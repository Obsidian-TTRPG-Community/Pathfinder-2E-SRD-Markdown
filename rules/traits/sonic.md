# Sonic  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 636*  

An effect with the sonic trait functions only if it makes sound, meaning it has no effect in an area of silence or in a vacuum. This is different from an auditory spell, which is effective only if the target can hear it. A sonic effect might deal sonic damage. A creature with this trait has a magical connection to powerful sound.
