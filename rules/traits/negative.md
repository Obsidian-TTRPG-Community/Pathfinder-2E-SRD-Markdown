# Negative  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 630*  

Effects with this trait heal undead creatures with negative energy, deal negative damage to living creatures, or manipulate negative energy. Creatures with this trait are natives of the Negative Energy Plane. They can survive the basic environmental effects of the Negative Energy Plane.

Planes with this trait are vast, empty reaches that suck the life from the living. They tend to be lonely, haunted planes, drained of color and filled with winds carrying the moans of those who died within them. At the end of each round, a living creature takes at least minor negative environmental damage. In the strongest areas of a negative plane, they could take moderate or even major negative damage at the end of each round. This damage has the [death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait") trait, and if a living creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points by this negative damage and killed, it crumbles into ash and can become a wraith. Negative magic is enhanced, and [positive](rules/traits/positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait") magic is impeded.

Effects with this trait heal undead creatures with negative energy, deal negative damage to living creatures, or manipulate negative energy.
