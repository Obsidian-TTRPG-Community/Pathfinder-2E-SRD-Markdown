# Good  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 632*  

Good effects often manipulate energy from good-aligned Outer Planes and are antithetical to evil divine servants or divine servants of evil deities. A creature with this trait is good in alignment.

An ability with this trait can be selected or used only by good creatures.
