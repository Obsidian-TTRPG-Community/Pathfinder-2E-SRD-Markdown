# Spellshape  
*Source: Rage of Elements p. 238*  

Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a spellshape action directly before casting the spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than casting a spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself.
