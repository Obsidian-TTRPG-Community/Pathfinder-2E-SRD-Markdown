# Trip  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 283*  

You can use this weapon to [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) with the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.
