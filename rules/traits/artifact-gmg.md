# Artifact  
*Source: Gamemastery Guide p. 250*  

Items with this trait are artifacts. These magic items can't be crafted by normal means, and they can't be damaged by normal means. Artifacts are always [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait") or [unique](rules/traits/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait").
