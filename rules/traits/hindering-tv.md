# Hindering  
*Source: Treasure Vault p. 8*  

This armor is so heavy and bulky it slows you down no matter what. You take a –5 penalty to all your Speeds (to a minimum of a 5‑foot Speed). This is separate from and in addition to the armor's Speed penalty, and affects you even if your Strength or an ability lets you reduce or ignore the armor's Speed penalty.
