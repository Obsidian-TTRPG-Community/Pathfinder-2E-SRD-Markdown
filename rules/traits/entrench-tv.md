# Entrench  
*Source: Treasure Vault p. 8*  

You can position yourself in the armor or reposition its articulated pieces to better protect against some attacks. If you're trained in this armor, while wearing it you can spend a single action to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against a certain type of attack until the start of your next turn. The entrench trait lists the type of attack this bonus applies against, typically entrench melee or entrench ranged.
