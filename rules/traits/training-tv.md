# Training  
*Source: Treasure Vault p. 26*  

A training weapon is designed to be used when training an animal to participate in combat by identifying the target for the animal to attack. [Striking](rules/actions/strike.md) a creature with a training weapon gives your animal companion or your bonded animal a +1 circumstance bonus to its next attack roll against that target.
