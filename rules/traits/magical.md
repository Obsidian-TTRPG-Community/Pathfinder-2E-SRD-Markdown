# Magical  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 633*  

Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.

Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the [arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](rules/traits/divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](rules/traits/occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), or [primal](rules/traits/primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait") trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.
