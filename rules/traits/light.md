# Light  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 633*  

Light effects overcome non-magical darkness in the area, and can counteract magical [darkness](rules/traits/darkness.md). You must usually target darkness magic with your light magic directly to counteract the darkness, but some light spells automatically attempt to counteract darkness.
