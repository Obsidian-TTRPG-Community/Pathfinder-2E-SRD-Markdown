# Additive  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 75*  

Feats with the additive trait allow you to spend actions to add special substances to bombs or elixirs. You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, and attempting to add another spoils the item. You can typically use actions with the additive trait only when you're creating an [infused](rules/traits/infused.md "Infused Item Trait") [alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait") item, and some can be used only with the [Quick Alchemy](rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md) action. The additive trait is always followed by a level, such as [additive <2>](rules/traits/additive-2.md "Additive Feat Trait"). An additive adds its level to the level of the alchemical item you're modifying; the result is the new level of the mixture. The mixture's item level must be no higher than your advanced alchemy level.
