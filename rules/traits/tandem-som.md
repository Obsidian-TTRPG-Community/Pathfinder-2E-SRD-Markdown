# Tandem  
*Source: Secrets of Magic p. 57*  

Actions with this trait involve you and your eidolon acting in concert. You can't use a tandem action if either you or your eidolon can't act, if you haven't [Manifested your Eidolon](rules/actions/manifest-eidolon-som.md), or if you've [Manifested your Eidolon](rules/actions/manifest-eidolon-som.md) in a way where it isn't a separate entity (such as with the [Meld into Eidolon](compendium/feats/meld-into-eidolon-som.md) feat). Tandem actions often let both you and your eidolon take separate actions, but these must be actions taken separately by you and your eidolon; you can't use a tandem action to take another tandem action.
