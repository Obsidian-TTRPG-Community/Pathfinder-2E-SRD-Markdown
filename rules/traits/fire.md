# Fire  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 632*  

Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or either conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate fire have no effect in an area without fire. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of fire or have a magical connection to that element.

Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn with no fuel source. Fire planes are extremely hostile to non-fire creatures.

Unprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost immediately, and creatures wearing unprotected flammable clothing catch fire, typically taking `1d6` [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). Extraplanar creatures take moderate environmental fire damage at the end of each round (sometimes minor environmental damage in safer areas, or major or massive damage in even more fiery areas). Fire magic is enhanced, and [cold](rules/traits/cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait") and [water](rules/traits/water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") magic are impeded. Water creatures are extremely uncomfortable on a fire plane, and any natural resistance they have against fire doesn't function against this environmental fire damage.
