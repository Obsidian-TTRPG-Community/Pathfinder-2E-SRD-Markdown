# Common  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 629*  

Anything that doesn't list another rarity trait ([uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md), [rare](rules/traits/rare.md), or [unique](rules/traits/unique.md)) automatically has the common trait. This rarity indicates that an ability, item, or spell is available to all players who meet the prerequisites for it.

A creature of this rarity is generally known and can be summoned with the appropriate summon spell.
