# Transmutation  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 637*  

Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically changing something's form.

Transmutation spells make alterations to or transform the physical form of a creature or object. The [morph](rules/traits/morph.md "Morph Effect Trait") and [polymorph](rules/traits/polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait") traits appear primarily in transmutation spells.
