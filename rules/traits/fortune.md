# Fortune  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 632*  

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a [misfortune](rules/traits/misfortune.md "Misfortune Effect Trait") effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
