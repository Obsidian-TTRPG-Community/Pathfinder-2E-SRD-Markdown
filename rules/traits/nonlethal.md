# Nonlethal  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 283*  

An effect with this trait is nonlethal. Damage from a nonlethal effect knocks a creature out rather than killing it.

Attacks with this weapon are nonlethal, and are used to knock creatures unconscious instead of kill them. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a â€“2 circumstance penalty.
