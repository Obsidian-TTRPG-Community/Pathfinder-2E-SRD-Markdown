# Gargantuan  
*Source: Bestiary p. 345*  

This size of creature takes up a space of at least 20 feet by 20 feet (16 squares on the grid), but can be much larger. Gargantuan creatures typically have a reach of 20 feet if they are tall, or 15 feet if they are long, but larger ones could have a much longer reach.
