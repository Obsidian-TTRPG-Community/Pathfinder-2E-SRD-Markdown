# Shield Throw  
*Source: Treasure Vault p. 219*  

A shield with this trait is designed to be thrown as a ranged attack. When thrown, the shield is a martial [thrown](rules/traits/thrown.md "Thrown Weapon Trait") ranged weapon. Its damage dice and type are the same as its shield bash attack, but if the shield includes an attached weapon or integrated weapon, you can choose to attack with it instead when you throw the shield. You add your Strength modifier to damage, as typical of a [thrown](rules/traits/thrown.md "Thrown Weapon Trait") weapon. The trait also includes the range increment.
