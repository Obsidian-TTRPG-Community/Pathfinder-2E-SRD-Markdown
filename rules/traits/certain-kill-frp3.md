# Certain Kill  
*Source: Fists of the Ruby Phoenix #3: King of the Mountain p. 51*  

The party has faced the Lightkeepers before, but never somewhere the villains could exhibit their full power. When Syndara chose these four fighters as his champions, he granted each a limited sovereignty over the planar laws of the _Glass Lighthouse_. Syu Tak-nwa received control over space, Hakusa over life, Ran-to over gravity, and Blue Viper over time. The Lightkeepers trained to integrate these planar abilities into their unique fighting styles, and now that they're fighting in the Lighthouse itself, they can use the fullest extent of their power. Each of their members can use a Certain Kill Art as long as they are within the _Glass Lighthouse_â€”these abilities, which have the certain kill trait, cause obvious distortions in the Lighthouse's fabric as the user calls upon their technique. However, as each technique requires one of the Lightkeepers to temporarily take command of the demiplane from the rest of their team, only one Certain Kill Art can be used by any of the Lightkeepers in a given round.
