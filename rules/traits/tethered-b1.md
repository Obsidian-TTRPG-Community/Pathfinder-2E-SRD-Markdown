# Tethered  
*Source: Bestiary p. 85*  

This weapon is attached to a length of rope or chain that allows you to retrieve it after it has left your hand. If you have a free hand while wielding this weapon, you can use an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to pull the weapon back into your grasp after you have thrown it as a ranged attack or after it has been [disarmed](rules/actions/disarm.md) (unless it is being held by another creature).
