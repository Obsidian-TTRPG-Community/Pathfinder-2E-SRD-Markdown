# Tiny  
*Source: Bestiary p. 345*  

A creature of this size takes up less than a 5-foot-by-5-foot space (1 square on the grid), and multiple Tiny creatures can occupy the same square on the grid. At least four Tiny creatures can occupy the same square, and even more can occupy the same square, at the GM's discretion. They can also occupy the same space as larger creatures, and if their reach is 0 feet, they must do so in order to attack.
