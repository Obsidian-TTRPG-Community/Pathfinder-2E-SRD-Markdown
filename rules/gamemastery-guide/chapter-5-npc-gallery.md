# Chapter 5: Npc Gallery
<sup>GMG p. 203</sup>

## Using the Npc Gallery
<sup>GMG p. 203</sup>

In this section, you'll find all kinds of NPCs across a variety of categories and roles for you to use in your game. Their levels span from –1 to 8, the range you most often need for stock characters. Since high-level opponents, major villains, ruling monarchs, and the like tend to be unique individuals, you'll likely create those NPCs specifically for the role they serve, using the rules for Building Creatures on page 56. But you can never have too many lower-level NPCs on hand when the PCs unexpectedly take an unusually keen interest in an NPC or pick a fight at a roadside tavern.

The level listed on an NPC's stat block is their level assuming they're used in combat; they should be able to hold their own as well as any other creature of that level. But many of these NPCs are primarily noncombatants who are much more skilled in their occupation than they ever would be in combat. To that end, those specialist NPCs' entries also mention a higher level that you would use when the PCs have to compete against them in their area of expertise.

### Customizing Npcs
<sup>GMG p. 203</sup>

The NPCs in this gallery are all humans with no languages besides Common. In some cases, such as human-centric Taldor where Common is the official language, you can most likely use the NPCs in this section as written. But more often, you'll need to make minor adjustments to the details to portray a particular NPC. Since these stat blocks present the most basic possible version for each character, you shouldn't need to remove any statistics or abilities unless your NPC can't speak Common.

The next few sections provide guidelines and ancestry adjustments you can use to quickly customize a default NPC.

### Adjusting Level
<sup>GMG p. 203</sup>

Sometimes you'll need an NPC that fills a particular role—say an angry drunk— but the level in the stat block presented isn't the right fit for your group. You can start by applying the elite or weak adjustments on page 6 of the _Bestiary_ to adjust the NPC's level by 1 in either direction.

If you need to change the NPC's level beyond that, use the values from the tables in Building Creatures in Chapter 2, and add or remove special abilities as necessary to suit the NPC's new level.

### Changing Alignment
<sup>GMG p. 203</sup>

Aside from some obviously aligned NPCs, like the villains, most of the NPCs in this gallery are presented as neutral. If you want to change an NPC's alignment, all you have to do is change their alignment trait. You might consider how the new alignment affects the NPC's personality and adjust their skills accordingly; for instance, a lawful evil teacher might have a higher modifier for [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) than [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy).

### Changing Languages
<sup>GMG p. 203</sup>

If you need a human character who speaks more languages to fit their backstory, nation of origin, or role, simply add those languages.

### Npc Ancestry Adjustments
<sup>GMG p. 204</sup>

To use one of the NPCs in this section to represent an NPC of a different ancestry, apply the adjustments below for the desired ancestry. These provide the basic features from that ancestry, like [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md), altered Speed, and unique abilities like a halfling's keen eyes. For other ancestries, you can create similar templates following the same format.

In addition to these base changes, you can add the effects of a specific heritage: you might apply the snow goblin heritage if your NPC is a Frostfur goblin and you want them to have cold resistance. You can also give them an ancestry feat, or even adjust their ability scores and skills to reflect the new ancestry's strengths and weaknesses.

For a half-elf, half-orc, or any other heritage essential to the character, you should always apply the heritage effect.

#### Dwarf
<sup>GMG p. 204</sup>

Change the [human](rules/traits/human.md "Human Ancestry & Heritage Trait") trait to [dwarf](rules/traits/dwarf.md "Dwarf Ancestry & Heritage Trait").

- Add Dwarven to the NPC's languages.
- Add [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md).
- Decrease the NPC's Speed by 5 feet. If the NPC already has a reduced Speed due to their armor, consider applying the [Unburdened Iron](compendium/feats/unburdened-iron.md) ancestry feat.

#### Elf
<sup>GMG p. 204</sup>

Change the [human](rules/traits/human.md "Human Ancestry & Heritage Trait") trait to [elf](rules/traits/elf.md "Elf Ancestry & Heritage Trait").

- Add [low-light vision](rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md).
- Increase the NPC's Speed by 5 feet.

#### Gnome
<sup>GMG p. 204</sup>

Change the [human](rules/traits/human.md "Human Ancestry & Heritage Trait") trait to [gnome](rules/traits/gnome.md "Gnome Ancestry & Heritage Trait").

- Add Gnomish and Sylvan to the NPC's languages.
- Add [low-light vision](rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md).

#### Halfling
<sup>GMG p. 204</sup>

- Add Halfling to the NPC's languages.
- Add the keen eyes ability below.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Keen Eyes** Your eyes are sharp, allowing you to make out small details about concealed or even invisible creatures that others might miss. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus when using the Seek action to find hidden or undetected creatures within 30 feet of you. When you target an opponent that is concealed from you or hidden from you, reduce the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or 9 for a hidden one.
```

### Making a Specialist
<sup>GMG p. 204</sup>

These NPCs contain several specialists, such as barristers and navigators, who are a higher-level challenge at their specialty than in combat, and often have a special ability related to it. To make your own specialists, you can easily switch out skills, but you might want to use the following special abilities to make those NPCs more evocative!

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Butter Up**  ([emotion](rules/traits/emotion.md), [mental](rules/traits/mental.md))


When someone eats a dish or treat made by this NPC, the NPC can attempt a Baking Lore, Cooking Lore, or similar check against that creature's Will DC, with the same results as the Make an Impression action of [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy). If more than one creature partakes, the NPC uses the same check result against each creature's Will DC.  
%%
 #trait/emotion  #trait/mental 
%%
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Call Your Bluff** When gambling, the NPC may use Games Lore to Sense Motive instead of Perception.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Child Care** When treating infants, the NPC can use their Midwifery Lore skill in place of [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine), and can use [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine)'s trained actions on infants.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Find Footing** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") ([concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md))


The NPC attempts an Architecture Lore, Engineering Lore, or similar skill check to find a stable path across uneven ground. This grants them and anyone they share this information with a +2 circumstance bonus on [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) checks to Balance across that ground.  
%%
 #trait/concentrate 
%%
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Gone Fishing** The NPC can use Fishing Lore to Track aquatic creatures or to Aid checks to Track them.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Local Lore** When they first meet a given person from their home settlement, the NPC can automatically attempt one check to Recall Knowledge about that person. This uses the Lore skill for that settlement.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Quick Transcription** The NPC can attempt to copy a document faster than normal, provided they don't alter the content. They attempt a Scribing Lore check, completing the task in half the time on a success (onequarter on a critical success).

* This NPC is a higher-level challenge in their area of expertise. The NPC's level during such a challenge is listed in parentheses.

## Courtiers
<sup>GMG p. 207</sup>

Though adventurers travel through perilous dungeons and across treacherous wilderness, sometimes the most dangerous place they can end up is in a noble court.

### Noble
<sup>GMG p. 207</sup>

Envied by many and detested by still others, nobles exude confidence and gentility. Gossip and gambling are often nobles' favorite pastimes. Day-to-day life for a noble is often a mixture of business and leisure, and to an onlooker, such a lifestyle can appear to be nothing more than a string of meals, parties, and game halls. However, despite what some might believe, life as a noble is often quite dangerous and requires far more intellect than it would appear—along with a healthy dose of suspicion.

### Palace Guard
<sup>GMG p. 207</sup>

Every palace has its gatekeepers. Often the younger offspring of minor nobility or those from long lines of trusted staff, the palace guards are in charge of defending the royal family and their inner stronghold. Their days consist of guarding doorways, escorting nobles to various locations, and keeping those in their charge as safe as possible. The statistics below are for the lowest rank-and-file member of a small nation's palace guards; they also work well for elite guards of a lesser noble.

### Advisor
<sup>GMG p. 208</sup>

Trusted counselors of the court, advisors whisper words of guidance in the ears of those in power. Many nobles lean so heavily on their counsel that they make few decisions without them and insist on their attendance at all meetings and public events. Advisors are often master manipulators, and their guidance can shape a barony or even a kingdom—for good or ill.

### Spy
<sup>GMG p. 208</sup>

No empire would be complete without its spies. The spy is a master of infiltrating the court and blending in: they might be one of a number of nobles, a beloved confidante of the queen, or even the court jester. Spies use their skills to subtly manipulate courtiers, turn enemies against one another, and collect valuable information either for blackmail or to auction to the highest bidder.

## Criminals
<sup>GMG p. 209</sup>

Some criminals are the desperate who have no option but to break the law to survive, while others choose a life of crime for thrills, forming gangs or underworld guilds that specialize in certain illegal ventures.

### Grave Robber
<sup>GMG p. 209</sup>

Many cultures have a tradition of burying their dead with a selection of the deceased's most precious possessions, and some include gifts that are thought to provide a boon in the afterlife. Such valuables can be easy pickings for those with no respect for—or fear of—the dead.

### Bandit
<sup>GMG p. 209</sup>

By setting ambushes and traps in concealing countryside, such as forests and mountains, bandits waylay travelers and plunder their valuables before disappearing back to their wilderness hideouts.

Many bandits seek only to steal and release their victims alive, though a few prefer to leave no witnesses.

### Ruffian
<sup>GMG p. 210</sup>

Using their strength to bully others into submission, ruffians often work as bodyguards and enforcers for powerful criminals like charlatans and fences.

### Charlatan
<sup>GMG p. 210</sup>

Charlatans use pretense and misdirection to swindle money and other valuables from the credulous and [confused](rules/conditions.md#Confused). Selling snake oil (literally or figuratively), distracting marks to pick their pockets, or faking mediumship are classic grifts.

### Burglar
<sup>GMG p. 211</sup>

Burglars specialize in breaking and entering to rob homes and businesses. These criminals focus on gaining access to secure buildings and bypassing traps and other security measures while remaining [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) all the while.

### Fence
<sup>GMG p. 211</sup>

The longer criminals hold on to stolen loot, the greater the chance they will get caught. Fences make themselves indispensable in the underworld by paying for stolen goods in order to resell them later, whether through a seemingly legitimate business or to a closed group of elite buyers.

### Assassin
<sup>GMG p. 212</sup>

Assassins commit murder, either for pay or due to their belief in a cause, such as a religion or a political movement. Some assassins work alone and choose their own victims. Others are members of assassins' guilds, organizations that accept contracts to kill in return for money, favors, or both.

## Devotees
<sup>GMG p. 212</sup>

Religions inspire devout individuals to uphold their tenets. Many of these devotees seek to bring respite and hope, but others have darker motives.

### Acolyte
<sup>GMG p. 212</sup>

Underling clerics are still learning the tenets of their faith and answer to a superior priest. Their days are spent in devotion and learning, sequestered in temples.

### Prophet
<sup>GMG p. 212</sup>

The gods occasionally send messages in dreams to individuals who wander the lands, gaining followers with their oratorical abilities. Some prophets have not received true divine missives, but have misinterpreted normal dreams.

### Zealot
<sup>GMG p. 212</sup>

Zealots ferret out plots against their religion and seek justice for their church's followers. This zealot serves Asmodeus, but others might serve [Abadar](compendium/setting/deities/abadar.md), Calistria, Iomedae, Norgorber, Pharasma, Sarenrae, or Zon-Kuthon. They often ride a war horse (_Bestiary_ 209) wearing light barding. This horse is an additional monster in the fight.

### Priest
<sup>GMG p. 213</sup>

Cloistered priests safeguard their temples and communities. They are the stalwart keepers of their god's tenets, devoted to spreading the word. Their guidance or healing services come at the cost of a donation.

## Downtrodden
<sup>GMG p. 214</sup>

Unfortunately, every society has people living on its fringes. While good communities work to grant aid and respite to their downtrodden, sometimes—due to economic downturn, famine, or war—the ranks of the less fortunate exceed the community's capacity to support them. In heartless neutral and evil societies, poverty is seen as an inevitability that can never be truly eradicated, or even worse, as a tool to be manipulated for political gain.

### Beggar
<sup>GMG p. 214</sup>

Wherever there is poverty, there are beggars. Beggars are truly the downtrodden of society—folks who have been cast out into the streets due to a variety of setbacks or the weight of circumstance. Some beggars work for underworld organizations as lookouts, spies, or even hired muscle on the cheap—sometimes by choice, but often not.

### Commoner
<sup>GMG p. 214</sup>

Though not every commoner is downtrodden, many live hard lives of toil as they work to keep their families fed and housed in relative comfort. While many commoners are just simple folks who keep to themselves, sometimes commoners rebel, either rising up to face their oppressors or persuaded or even duped into joining nefarious plans and criminal conspiracies.

Commoners benefit from power in numbers, and a crowd of commoners can accomplish a great deal more than their rulers often expect.

### Urchin
<sup>GMG p. 215</sup>

Although their escapades might be notorious, few urchins are thrill-seekers. For some urchins, when begging alone is not enough to fill their bellies, theft becomes a viable survival tactic. Many underworld powers also use urchins as spies and messengers, while training them to become future pickpockets, burglars, and foot soldiers.

### Prisoner
<sup>GMG p. 215</sup>

Most who end up in a jail, dungeon, or prison are just biding their time until their imprisonment ends, trying to find ways to make it through interminable days of boredom and deprivation. Some, however, may use their time on the inside to strengthen their criminal connections. Using force and intimidation to gain status among other prisoners, they create makeshift weapons to take down their enemies and give them an edge if escape becomes possible. Even for prisoners who don't become involved in the world of prison politics, learning to stand up for themselves and projecting an air of toughness can become essential for survival in a place where people have little left to lose.

## Explorers
<sup>GMG p. 216</sup>

The world is a wide, open place fraught with peril and adventure. Explorers use their knowledge of nature and survival skills to see every corner of the land.

### Torchbearer
<sup>GMG p. 216</sup>

Torchbearers carry a light sources for seasoned explorers and serve as apprentices.

### Chronicler
<sup>GMG p. 216</sup>

Exploration means very little if no account of the details exist. Members of adventuring bands cherish chroniclers who record tales of their deeds.

### Guide
<sup>GMG p. 216</sup>

Guides bring travelers, tourists, and adventurers into the wondrous natural world, using their expertise to avoid deadly monsters and gruesome hazards.

### Tomb Raider
<sup>GMG p. 217</sup>

Great treasure awaits those willing to explore the hazardous depths of the world's ancient tombs and forgotten dungeons. Some tomb raiders seek riches of bygone eras; others recover pieces of history thought lost to the sands of time.

## Foresters
<sup>GMG p. 219</sup>

From the managed and cultivated forests that support villages to the tree-covered crown lands where only nobles and their servants are permitted to hunt, forests provide. To communities, forests provide fuel, food, medicine, and raw materials, while royally protected forests provide food for the nobles' table and a source of entertainment in the form of organized hunts. Even the ancient woods untouched by mortal hand or blade provide bards with settings where legends happened and could happen again. Many find the forest depths unsettling, but others live their lives among the trees and alongside the creatures that make their homes there.

### Poacher
<sup>GMG p. 219</sup>

Some forests are protected by kings, others only by wild things. Laws against hunting may protect the private reserves of nobles or guard the viability of animal populations of shared forests during specific seasons. Poachers violate those laws— sometimes out of greed, sometimes out of desperation, and sometimes for sport.

Although penalties against poaching often include public shaming (see Penalties for Poaching), in lean times a successful poacher is a local hero.

### Tracker
<sup>GMG p. 219</sup>

The forest offers dangerous creatures—whether they walk on four legs or two—a place to hide. Dim light, low brush, and fallen leaves conspire to hide their trails. Given these poor conditions, an unskilled eye might spot a sign or two of a creature's passing, but only a skilled tracker can identify several such signs and discern their relationship to each other, connecting one to the next until they form a trail of prints, scat, fur, feathers, and blood that leads to the quarry's lair.

### Hunter
<sup>GMG p. 220</sup>

As is reflected in the many depictions of an elk-headed Erastil, god of the hunt, the hunter is very much a creature of the forest, known by the forest and familiar with every aspect of it. After all, the final determination of who is the hunter and who is prey often depends on who is able to make an ally of the terrain.

## Healers
<sup>GMG p. 221</sup>

The world is a dangerous place. Thankfully, there are those who devote their lives to easing the pain and suffering of others.

### Apothecary
<sup>GMG p. 221</sup>

Surrounded by bottles and bins of crushed herbs, curative minerals, and potent extracts, the apothecary skillfully combines materials into unguents and medicines. For encounters involving making medicine or alchemical contests, the apothecary is a 3rd-level challenge.

### Physician
<sup>GMG p. 221</sup>

The art of medicine is a blend of the intellectual and the practical, concerned with how diseases work and how to prevent them. The physician can be found consulting well-thumbed tomes while meticulously examining patients to better understand their condition, before determining the most effective treatment. For medical matters, the physician is a 4th-level challenge.

### Surgeon
<sup>GMG p. 221</sup>

The surgeon specializes in the physical alteration of the body to prevent the spread of disease, removing necrotic and decaying flesh to help the whole to survive. Few healers know the science of anatomy and physiology better than the surgeon.

While their expertise is of grave importance in the medical world, the downside is that when one is in need of their talents, it is likely the complaint is serious. In medical matters, a surgeon is a 6th-level challenge.

### Plague Doctor
<sup>GMG p. 222</sup>

These healers, often seen wearing distinctive masks and burning powders to defend against airborne plagues, are as much feared as they are respected. To see a plague doctor signals that disease has infested the land—and that it might have already taken hold. Despite their devoted work in curing the untouchable, they are sometimes treated with suspicion, as if they are somehow the cause of the plague.

## Laborers
<sup>GMG p. 223</sup>

Every day, laborers perform backbreaking physical work.

### Servant
<sup>GMG p. 223</sup>

Maids, butlers, and majordomos alike, servants are skilled at keeping a home in working order and protecting the interests of their employers.

### Dockhand
<sup>GMG p. 223</sup>

Working to load and unload cargo from ships, dockhands are considered unruly, but many stay focused and work hard until the job is done. Some do celebrate the end of their work day with rowdy drinking.

### Farmer
<sup>GMG p. 223</sup>

Workers of the fields, vineyards, and orchards of the world, farmers are known for their rugged endurance and their skill with both plants and animals.

### Miner
<sup>GMG p. 224</sup>

Miners explore deep underground in search of minerals and rare materials, taking numerous precautions to keep themselves safe.

### Gravedigger
<sup>GMG p. 224</sup>

An often-overlooked group of laborers, gravediggers have a reputation for being as quiet and grim as their workplace. They are commonly strong and tough from their long hours of backbreaking labor, and they tend to have a unique perspective on life and death.

## Magistrates
<sup>GMG p. 224</sup>

Magistrates are the cogs and gears that keep bureaucracy running, moving the machine along under the inertia of the status quo.

### Judge
<sup>GMG p. 224</sup>

These magistrates have the final say on the intent and spirit of the law. Properly exercised, the duty of a judge is the strict adherence to the law regardless of station, with minimal sentimentality toward rationalization and justification of why the law was broken. Yet expectations and practice are not always the same thing. For every unbiased justice, there is one who is zealously confident in their own agenda.

In a court case or other legal proceeding, the judge is a 6th-level challenge.

### Tax Collector
<sup>GMG p. 224</sup>

Ledgers and marks, positive and negative flows, and levies and allotments are a tax collector's daily bread. Where coin is gained, from whom it is collected, and to whom is it disbursed are their main concerns; the collector is unconcerned with whether the taxed can afford it or take a loan to make up for any shortfall. However, tax collectors aren't immune to corruption: arrangements can be made, deals discussed, documents altered, or coin misappropriated. When dealing with matters of taxes and finance, the tax collector is a 3rd-level challenge.

### Harbormaster
<sup>GMG p. 225</sup>

There are three flows important to any port: the seaward and coastal flows, marked by the rise and fall of the tides, and the flow of trade. A harbormaster is expected to know the former two reflexively and encourage the latter while knowing jurisdictional rules of law. Often old hands of the sea, harbormasters find themselves anchored to a port by commitment, conflict, or reputation.

### Warden
<sup>GMG p. 225</sup>

Wardens are the chief guardians of borders and frontiers. Whether they stand watch over a single village or an entire region, wardens keep a vigilant eye out for outside threats to their charges. Wardens are stalwart folk, often called to duty by Erastil to protect those around them. Be it times of war or upon the frontier, wardens are often the balanced edge of a blade between a community and the wilds at its fringes.

## Mercenaries
<sup>GMG p. 226</sup>

A broad category that includes those wielding arms, spells, or even guile and cunning, mercenaries hire themselves and their expertise to those with the gold to pay for it.

### Bodyguard
<sup>GMG p. 226</sup>

Hired to protect someone famous or powerful, bodyguards use intimidation, quick wits, and martial skill to keep their charges safe. Such mercenaries might be auxiliaries to a noble's own guards, but with special directives to safeguard their patrons.

### Mage for Hire
<sup>GMG p. 226</sup>

Not all mercenaries sell brawn and intimidating glares. Some sell their magical talents to earn a living. While there are many types of mages for hire, some of the sneakiest are specialized in divination, using their skills for infiltration and sabotage.

### Bounty Hunter
<sup>GMG p. 226</sup>

Bounty hunters are constantly on the move, whether within city walls or the wilderness, trailing their fugitive quarries for capture... or disposal. Often relying on stealth or deception as much as martial skill, bounty hunters employ a vast array of talents to accomplish their goals, not to mention to collect the hefty payout that follows.

### Monster Hunter
<sup>GMG p. 227</sup>

Some mercenaries eschew the complications of politics, oaths of service, and fealty and just get paid to hunt monsters. It's a straightforward form of mercenary service, often dangerous in the extreme, but one that can yield glory and fame.

## Mystics
<sup>GMG p. 228</sup>

Those initiated into the hidden truths and forbidden secrets of the world are forever transformed—or so they claim. To the cynical, a mystic is nothing more than a charlatan or zealot. Others profess to sense an aura around such luminaries and treat them with reverence, lest they offend some harbinger of unspeakable doom.

### Adept
<sup>GMG p. 228</sup>

Adepts have unlocked only the most minor occult mysteries of the universe. A few are chosen by accomplished practitioners for further training. Others volunteer to join a cabal by passing an initiation ritual.

### Harrow Reader
<sup>GMG p. 228</sup>

A harrow deck is a set of 54 cards with symbolic illustrations that serves as a sacred divining tool. Feared by the superstitious and avoided by those who know better than to tempt fate, harrow readers live and work in traveling communities, often moving from town to town as opportunities arise. For encounters involving social interaction, the harrow reader is a 3rd-level challenge.

### Cultist
<sup>GMG p. 228</sup>

Excessively zealous, a cultist finds exalted purpose in their sect. Never questioning their leader, they devote themselves to achieving their most perfect spiritual form.

### False Priest
<sup>GMG p. 229</sup>

Belief is perhaps the strongest force in the universe, driving many to great heights. Instilling a sense of belief and then using that belief against someone, however, is the discipline of a false priest. Combining their gifts of deception, a silver tongue, and an impeccable sense of timing, the false priest can gain influence among the powerful, entice a mark to dispose of all their possessions, and make a believer out of a cynic.

<sup>GMG p. 233</sup>

Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. In good-aligned societies, these officials carry out their duties fairly.

<sup>GMG p. 233</sup>

Guards are rank-and-file members of a town watch or city guard, trained to look for trouble, take down criminals, and follow orders.

<sup>GMG p. 241</sup>

The greatest knowledge comes from experience. Village elders, ancient seers, and advisors to royalty are examples of individuals who are valued for their experiences.
