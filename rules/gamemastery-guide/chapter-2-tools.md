# Chapter 2: Tools
<sup>GMG p. 55</sup>

> [!pf2-sidebar] BUILDING VERSUS MODIFYING
> 
> Many times, a small adjustment to an existing creature, item, adventure, or other part of the game can serve you just as well as building something brand new. Before you delve into creating your own new content, ask yourself a few questions. First, does something similar already exist? When answering this question, look beyond the surface level. Maybe you want a 5th-level clawed centipede creature that can make Attacks of Opportunity and that regenerates unless hit by acid or fire damage. It might not look very much like a troll on the surface, but the statistics for a troll are going to get you most or all the way there. Ask yourself what you'll need to change between your idea and the existing material. This will help you decide between using the original rule with minimal modification, using the original with adjustments, starting with the original as a framework to build your own, or just starting from scratch. Finally, ask yourself how much time you have to prepare the content, what overall impact you expect it to have in your campaign, and how important any discrepancies from existing material are to the core concept. The less important an element is to your game, or the less time you'll be using it at the table, the more likely you should modify something that already exists.

This chapter provides a variety of tools to help you quickly and easily build your own elements for your game, as well as some special types of rules you can incorporate in your game, such as more hazards and strange magic items. This chapter is organized into the following sections.

- **Building Creatures** (page 56) demonstrates a top-down approach for quickly and easily constructing the creatures and NPCs you want or need for any possible situation in your game.
- **Building Hazards** (page 74) gives rules and advice for creating your own brand-new hazards.
- **Building Items** (page 82) teaches you how to create new pieces of treasure to delight your PCs.
- **Item Quirks** (page 86) introduces simple but memorable quirks that you can use to quickly personalize an item and make its nature seem just as unique and exciting as its special abilities.
- **Intelligent Items** (page 88) includes rules for creating items with a mind of their own that are characters in their own right, as well as several examples to get you started.
- **Cursed Items** (page 90) examines items that have a nasty drawback or might be altogether unpleasant. The section includes specific cursed items and a list of curses you can add to an existing item, akin to a rune.
- **Relics** (page 94) are special magic items that increase in power along with the PCs, and that you and your players work together to build and enhance.
- **Artifacts** (page 106) are the most powerful and story-rich magic items in the game, and can only be destroyed in a specific way.
- **Gems and Art Objects** (page 114) expands the diversity of monetary awards given to PCs and includes 100 sample art objects.
- **Afflictions** (page 116) provides a plethora of curses, diseases, and drugs for use in your games, as well as drug and addiction rules useful in creating your own afflictions.
- **Building Worlds** (page 122) explains how to go about building your own entire world or setting from scratch. This section leads into the next three, which provide tools to help you flesh out the finer details of specific parts of your game world.
- **Nations** (page 130) includes a system to quickly encapsulate a nation in a stat block that contains all the information you need.
- **Settlements** (page 132) covers everything from tiny villages to incredible metropolises. The section explains the settlement's role in a game and provides a system to describe a settlement in a stat block with all the important information.
- **Planes** (page 136) includes the various planar traits you can use to build your own planes, and explores all the planes of reality in the Age of Lost Omens setting as well.

It's up to you to determine how much of your game you want to customize. Many GMs use the default rules and creatures, and set their adventures on Golarion or another published game world. Other GMs devise and incorporate all-new creatures and places with strange themes that don't fit in the standard Pathfinder game or world. Unless you're building your entire game world from scratch, you can usually wait to implement any new rules creation until you think you'll need it for your next session.

## Building Creatures
<sup>GMG p. 55</sup>

Creatures aren't built the same way PCs are. The rules for building them are more flexible, and their statistics are based on benchmark final numbers rather than combining each individual modifier together. This is called top-down design, in which you consider the design process as a whole and select the details that reflect your intended result, rather than building statistics from the bottom up and hoping the finished creature matches your vision.

This guide provides a step-by-step process to build creatures, but as you get more comfortable with creature creation, you may prefer to use different methods. You could start with one ability you think is cool, or you might look to create a spellcaster of a certain type. There's no wrong starting place or wrong way to compile and present your creation; some GMs prefer to generate a stat block that is as similar to an official _Bestiary_ entry as possible, while others prefer to compile just a brief set of notes.

### Develop the Concept
<sup>GMG p. 56</sup>

To begin making a creature, you should first come up with its concept. You likely already have the basic idea. As you add details to the general idea, taking notes can help keep your creature on track. Consider the parts of your creature you find most compelling and that you want to emphasize when the creature hits the table. For example, in the _Bestiary_, demons are creatures of sin, and are designed to have weaknesses against specific virtues that oppose them. Harpies enchant creatures by singing, represented by their centerpiece ability, Captivating Song. Note your creature's core aspects, and if you feel uncertain later, you can look back and ask yourself, "Does this emphasize a core aspect or not?" Next, look at the creature's role in your game.

Is it meant to be a combatant? A social creature? A trusted ally? Figuring this out will help you determine whether to give it strong combat abilities or to focus on skills, spells, and special abilities. Think about how the creature might behave if it's in a fight, if someone tries to talk to it, or if it's in a social situation. Does it work better alone or with allies? What sort of character should be best at facing it or be particularly weak against it? Consider also the complexity of the creature. This matters most when you plan to use a large number of creatures of that type. If you'll use five at the same time, you'll want their turns to move swiftly and avoid complex special actions. A creature likely to face a group of PCs alone can have more abilities, and it might need a more versatile set of defenses against PC tactics. Cut complexity as much as you can while retaining your desired theme.

Now, how do you want an encounter with this creature to feel? Should it be scary? Mobile? Confusing? A mystical duel or a knock-down, drag-out fight? What can you give your creature to convey those characteristics? Note that much of this feel will come from your choice of the creature's special abilities or spells, rather than its raw numbers.

With all this in mind, think about the specific abilities your creature should have. Take a few notes now, and get to the details later. You can use abilities from the _Bestiary_ or feats in the _Core Rulebook_, adjusting as needed, to save yourself time. It helps to think of a creature that's similar to yours and see what makes it tickâ€”and what you can steal from it. Maybe you can just reskin that creature (page 58), instead of making a new one from scratch.

Now that you understand your creature's concept, it's time to get to the statistics. Remember that you can always change your concept later on. Your creation might evolve and transform as you go, so be open to change and revisions.

> ### DESIGNING NPCS (PAGE 72)
> <sup>GMG p. 57</sup>
> 
> Sometimes you'll design a creature that's meant to have abilities or characteristics similar to those of a PC. Maybe you need a bold champion, a sly rogue master criminal, or a wizened druid elder for your game. You also might need a common baker, who has little combat ability but great skill with dough and an oven. This section provides ways you might modify aspects of the creature-building process to fit those needs.

### Understanding and Choosing Statistics
<sup>GMG p. 57</sup>

Most of the statistics in this section use a scale of extreme, high, moderate, and lowâ€”some use terrible values as well.

**Extreme:** The creature is world class in this statistic and can challenge almost any character. Most creatures have no extreme statistics or only one extreme statistic, although some creatures might have additional extreme statistics and weaker related statistics elsewhere (a common example being a creature trading accuracy for extreme damage). Examples from the _Bestiary_ include the succubus's [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) and the lich's spell DC.

**High:** Extremely capable but not world class, the creature presents a challenge for most characters. Just about all creatures have at least one high value. Most combat-focused creatures have high AC and either a high attack bonus and high damage, or a merely moderate attack bonus but extreme damage. An ogre warrior's attack bonus and a kobold scout's [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) are high values.

**Moderate:** A middle-of-the road statistic can cover anything unremarkable about the creature. Use this one often.

**Low:** The creature is actively bad at this. Choose these intentionally to represent the creature's weak points.

Most creatures should have at least one low statistic; an example is the goblin pyro's Will save.

**Terrible:** Some statistics can dip even lower than low, to terrible. This indicates a truly awful statistic that still isn't game-breakingly bad. A spider's Intelligence is terrible, as is a dero stalker's Will save.

#### Push and Pull
<sup>GMG p. 57</sup>

When it comes to statistics, a creature should be balanced overall. That means if you're giving a creature an extreme statistic, it should have some low or terrible statistics to compensate. For example, if you were making a creature extremely hard to hit by giving it an extreme AC, you'd likely give it lower saving throws or low HP. If a creature is great at spellcasting, it might need several low statistics to be a balanced challenge. There's no perfect system for making these decisions. If you've made a creature that has four high stats and nothing low, or vice-versa, take another look. A creature's strengths and weaknesses change the PCs' strategies for dealing with it, and that's what makes playing the game fun!

> [!pf2-brown] RESKINNING A CREATURE
> 
> Sometimes you need a creature with abilities that are almost exactly the same as those of a published creature. In that case, it can be more efficient to simply "reskin" the old creature rather than design a new oneâ€”that is, to change the description but keep the abilities mostly the same. Occasionally reskinning requires small mechanical adjustments. For instance, a fire cat that has immunity to fire, an aura that deals fire damage, and the ability to light people on fire with its jaws to deal [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) could be reskinned as a caustic animate tree that has immunity to acid, an aura that deals acid damage, and branch attacks that smear acidic sap on a creature's body when they hit, dealing [persistent acid damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

#### Extreme Increases
<sup>GMG p. 58</sup>

At the higher levels of the game, PCs have more tools at their disposal, so the creatures they face need to hit back harder! At higher levels, give each creature more extreme statistics. Having one extreme statistic becomes typical around 11th level. A creature of 15th level or higher typically has two extreme statistics, and one of 20th level or higher should have three or four. Keep in mind that these should be relevant to the encounters you expect them to haveâ€”extreme social skills aren't much use to a combatfocused creature. Be careful about giving multiple extreme statistics that are closely linked: a creature with extreme damage and Fortitude saves is one thing, but having an extreme attack bonus and extreme damage allows the creature to apply both extreme statistics to each attack.

### Level
<sup>GMG p. 58</sup>

For most creatures you build, their level depends on the level of the party who will encounter it. Look at other creatures you think are similar in power to yours to determine its level. Note that level represents a creature's combat ability, so a creature that's more social might have, for example, 3rd-level combat statistics and 6th-level skills but remain a 3rd-level creature. Most such creatures are NPCs; for more information on this distinction and how to use it, see Non-Combat Level on page 72.

Some abilities are hard for PCs to deal with at low levels. For instance, creatures that can fly and have ranged attacks should typically appear around 7th level, when PCs gain access to flight. Natural invisibility or at-will _invisibility_ as an innate spell should come at around 6th level, when PCs are more likely to prepare _see invisibility_ in lower-level spell slots, or 8th level, when some PCs get the Blind-Fight feat.

The tables in this chapter go up to 24th levelâ€”the highest-level extreme encounter a party might face.

### Alignment, Size, and Traits
<sup>GMG p. 58</sup>

Fill out the trait line of your creature's stat block. The alignment can be whatever suits your story, though some types of creatures must be or tend to be certain alignments.

Creatures can be whatever size you need them to be, though you seldom find Large creatures below 1st level, Huge creatures below 5th level, or Gargantuan creatures below 10th level. Generally, you don't automatically adjust statistics for size, except for an exception to Strength modifiers for Large and bigger creatures, which you'll find in Ability Modifiers on the next page.

Your creature will almost certainly have one of the following traits to define its type: aberration, animal, astral, beast, celestial, construct, dragon, elemental, ethereal, fey, fiend, fungus, giant, humanoid, monitor, ooze, plant, or undead. If you're making a creature from an existing category of a type, such as demon, it also has that category as a trait. Creatures with a close affinity to elementsâ€”air, earth, fire, and waterâ€”or types of energyâ€”like acid, cold, and electricityâ€”have those traits.

Some abilities typical of creatures with the traits listed above can be found in Trait Abilities on page 70. As with the other steps, looking at similar creatures will give you an idea of what traits to use.

Add any traits that have detailed rules attached to them, like amphibious, aquatic, incorporeal, mindless, and swarm. You can add traits related to the creature category, such as dinosaur or werecreature, but most of these traits are pretty self-evident in play. If at any point you realize during play that you didn't add a trait the creature really should have, you can usually apply it retroactively.

> [!pf2-brown] BASE ROAD MAPS
> 
> You can use the following suggestions to set the baseline when creating your road map. For example, use brute for a big, tough creature like an ogre, and skirmisher for a darting enemy. Each entry is a starting point you can customize as you see fit. Any core statistic that isn't listed should typically use moderate numbers. You can set ability modifiers and add additional abilities as needed. To make a creature that resembles a character of a certain class, see Class Road maps on page 73.
> 
> **Brute** low [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception); high or extreme Str modifier, high to moderate Con modifier, low or lower Dex and mental modifiers; moderate or low AC; high Fortitude, low Reflex or Will or both; high HP; high attack bonus and high damage or moderate attack bonus and extreme damage
> 
> **Magical Striker** high attack and high damage; moderate to high spell DCs; either a scattering of innate spells or prepared or spontaneous spells up to half the creature's level (rounded up) minus 1
> 
> **Skill Paragon** high or extreme ability modifier matching its best skills; typically high Reflex or Will and low Fortitude; many skills at moderate or high and potentially one or two extreme skills; at least one special ability to use the creature's skills in combat
> 
> **Skirmisher** high Dex modifier; low Fortitude, high Reflex; higher Speed than typical
> 
> **Sniper** high [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception); high Dex modifier; low Fortitude, high Reflex; moderate to low HP; ranged [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) have high attack bonus and damage or moderate attack bonus and extreme damage (melee [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) are weaker)
> 
> **Soldier** high Str modifier; high to extreme AC; high Fortitude; high attack bonus and high damage; [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md) or other tactical abilities
> 
> **Spellcaster** high or extreme modifier for the corresponding mental ability; low Fortitude, high Will; low HP; low attack bonus and moderate or low damage; high or extreme spell DCs; prepared or spontaneous spells up to half the creature's level (rounded up)

### Ability Modifiers
<sup>GMG p. 59</sup>

Next, figure out your creature's ability modifiers, since these will suggest what their other statistics should be.

You don't have to determine the exact numbers, but it's good to avoid creating creatures whose ability modifiers are at odds with their abilities, like creatures with a terrible Wisdom modifier and very high [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception). Most of the time, you'll just be using ability modifiers for untrained skills, so they're useful as a guide but not crucial.

Table 2â€“1 shows some benchmarks for your creatures.

Use high for the creature's best ability modifiers, moderate for ones they're okay at, and low for the rest.

If a creature has a truly bad ability, you can go as low as â€“5. That's the terrible range for ability modifiers, and doesn't really change by level. This is most common with animals, which have an Intelligence modifier of â€“4 (for dogs, dolphins, and such) or â€“5 (for more instinctual animals like spiders), and for mindless creatures, which have a â€“5 Intelligence modifier.

Few creatures use the extreme column. A powerful, dedicated spellcaster might use an extreme spellcasting statistic, or a preternaturally charming creature like a succubus or nymph might have an extreme Charisma modifier. However, the most common way extreme numbers are used is for really big, really strong creatures.

This happens with only Large or larger creatures from 1st to 5th level, only Huge or larger creatures from 6th to 9th level, and only Gargantuan creatures from 10th to 15th level. Beyond that level, a creature doesn't gain an extreme Strength modifier from size alone.

| Level | Extreme | High | Moderate | Low |
|-------|---------|------|----------|-----|
| â€“1 | â€” | +3 | +2 | +0 |
| 0 | â€” | +3 | +2 | +0 |
| 1 | +5 | +4 | +3 | +1 |
| 2 | +5 | +4 | +3 | +1 |
| 3 | +5 | +4 | +3 | +1 |
| 4 | +6 | +5 | +3 | +2 |
| 5 | +6 | +5 | +4 | +2 |

| 22 | +11 | +10 | +8 | +6 |
| 23 | +11 | +10 | +8 | +6 |
| 24 | +13 | +12 | +9 | +7 |

### Perception
<sup>GMG p. 60</sup>

[Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) is a fairly straightforward statistic. Use Wisdom as a guide for setting it, and adjust to the high side if your creature has acute senses or extra training. If your creature has low Wisdom, for example, it would probably have a low [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) modifier, or moderate if it's supposed to be a great hunter. Don't make your creature's [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) higher just because it's often used for initiative; creatures with poor [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) could use a skill check for initiative instead, such as [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth).

#### Senses
<sup>GMG p. 60</sup>

Choose or design any special senses for your creature, such as [low-light vision](rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md), [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md), or [scent](rules/abilities/scent.md). If you're making a sense from scratch, simply decide what it senses, whether it has a range limit, and whether it's precise or imprecise.

For example, a sinspawn has "sin scent (imprecise) 30 feet." This means it can smell creatures bearing its associated sin if they're within 30 feet, and the sense is impreciseâ€”about as acute as human hearing.

| Level | Extreme | High | Moderate | Low | Terrible |
|-------|---------|------|----------|-----|----------|
| â€“1 | +9 | +8 | +5 | +2 | +0 |
| 0 | +10 | +9 | +6 | +3 | +1 |

| 23 | +44 | +40 | +37 | +34 | +31 |
| 24 | +46 | +42 | +38 | +36 | +32 |

### Languages
<sup>GMG p. 60</sup>

Think about what languages the creature would need to communicate with other creatures in its home. For instance, many intelligent undead speak Necril, and many creatures from the Darklands speak Undercommon. If you want your creature to be able to speak to the PCs, be sure it has Common; for a creature with no reason to speak the common tongue of your setting (such as most extraplanar creatures in a typical campaign), be sure it doesn't. Some creatures can understand language but can't vocalize; in this case, you can state that they can't speak any language. For creatures that need to be able to infiltrate and communicate wherever they go, you might give them [tongues](compendium/spells/tongues.md) or a similar ability as a constant innate spell.

### Skills
<sup>GMG p. 60</sup>

You have lots of flexibility in setting your creature's skills.

Pick some skills you think are appropriate, and consider how good the creature is at them. High skills are roughly on par with a specialized PC of the creature's level, though they could be a little lower or higher. Most creatures have at least one high skill, but no more than three. The best skills should go with the best ability modifiers, and you might even want to estimate the creature's proficiency rank for these skills. Some skills can get a high bonus for free to fit the creature's theme, particularly [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skills.

> [!pf2-brown] CONVERTING FIRST EDITION CREATURES
> 
> If you're converting creatures from First Edition, you won't find a direct numerical conversion. Instead, use the original statistics to create your road map, giving a better AC to a creature that had a good AC in First Edition, and so on.
> 
> Here are the main areas of difference that you'll want to keep in mind for your conversion.
> 
> - Ability modifiers scale differently, so don't copy them over exactly. The highest modifiers tend not to get as high in Second Edition. You'll rarely see a +10 Strength modifier, for example. Creatures also tend to get better low statistics at higher levels than they used to, particularly for Dexterity and Wisdom. This is most evident in high-level First Edition creatures with awful Dexterity.
> - Low-Intelligence creatures, particularly animals, tend to have more special actions than they would have in First Edition. This is to make encounters with them more dynamic and distinct. Compare dinosaurs between the editions for good examples.
> - When converting spell-like abilities to innate spells, you might need to make some substitutions. Some spells will appear as heightened versions of spells (such as greater dispel magic now being heightened dispel magic), but others will require you to find something different. Also, don't feel like you need to keep every spell; focus on the most thematic and potent ones. The Spells section on page 65 has more advice on this subject.
> - Damage reduction has been replaced with two options: resistance to all damage (possibly with exceptions), or more HP and a weakness. Immunities, Weaknesses, and Resistances on page 63 describes the distinction.
> - If you want to convert spell resistance, you can give the creature a +1 status bonus to all saves against magic, or +2 if it had abnormally high spell resistance for its level.

Most creatures don't have an extreme skill unless they are world class for their level, like a succubus's [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy). Having an extreme skill is less impactful than an extreme AC or attack bonus, but still might warrant a sacrifice elsewhere, especially if the creature also has more high skills than usual. There's no need for terrible skill modifiers, since an untrained skill usually represents that.

| 23 | +46 | +43 | +38 | +36 to +32 |
| 24 | +48 | +45 | +40 | +38 to +33 |

#### Special Modifiers
<sup>GMG p. 61</sup>

You can also add special, thematic modifiers for certain skill uses. For instance, you might give a creature that secretes adhesive "[Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) +7 (+9 to [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md) or [Grab](rules/abilities/grab.md))." This special bonus should still remain at or below the extreme number, especially if it has a combat purpose like the Grab bonus above.

### Items
<sup>GMG p. 61</sup>

If you gave a creature gear equivalent to a PC, your PCs would gain a huge amount of treasure by defeating a large group of them. Using Table 2â€“4: Safe Items can help you avoid that. A creature can have a single permanent item of the listed level without issue. For example, if a 6th-level creature has a _+1 weapon_, that item's not worth so much that the PCs would be massively rich if they encountered many creatures of that type and sold everything they found. You can give a creature several lower-level items too. Just pay attention to your overall treasure as measured against the guidelines on pages 508â€“510 of the _Core Rulebook_. At the lowest levels, a creature can certainly have multiple level 0 items, even though normally a creature should have only one item of the level listed in the Safe Item Level column.

Specific creatures or NPCs have more leeway to break these guidelines because you can plan the rest of your adventure's loot around them. Also, giving a boss villain a powerful magic item makes the fight and its aftermath more interesting.

| Creature Level | Safe Item Level |
|----------------|-----------------|
| 3 or lower | 0 |
| 4â€”5 | 1 |
| 6 | 2 (+1 weapon) |
| 7 | 3 |

| 23 | 19 (+3 major striking weapon) |
| 24 | 20 (+3 major resilient armor) |

### Armor Class
<sup>GMG p. 61</sup>

Because AC is one of the most important combat stats, you need to be more careful with setting this number for any creature you expect will end up in a fight. Low AC typically fits spellcasters, who compensate with their selection of powerful spells. Most creatures use high or moderate ACâ€”high is comparable to what a PC fighter would have. Reserve extreme AC for a creature that is even better defended; these values are for creatures that have defenses similar in power to those of a champion or monk.

| Level | Extreme | High | Moderate | Low |

| â€“1 | 18 | 15 | 14 | 12 |

#### Compensating with Hp and Saves
<sup>GMG p. 62</sup>

You might adjust your creature's HP, AC, and saves in tandem. Almost no creature has great defenses in all areas, as such creatures often result in frustrating fights. A creature with higher AC might have fewer HP and weaker saves, and one that's easy to hit could have more HP and a strong Fortitude to compensate. This depends on the theme of the creature. An extreme AC might mean reducing the creature's HP to the next lowest category, or reducing its HP by a smaller amount and making another reduction elsewhere.

> [!pf2-brown] IMPROVISING A CREATURE
> 
> As you get more experienced, you might find that you don't need to build some creatures in advance. In many cases, especially for simple creatures, you can just select values from the relevant tables on the fly and track its HP. When you do, track which value you used as it came up. For instance, let's say you're improvising a 2nd-level kobold soldier. When it's time for initiative, you decide it has moderate [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) and jot down "Per +8." Your group's fighter beats it at initiative and attacks. You decide the soldier has high ACâ€”looking at Table 2â€“5, you see that's 18â€”and add this information to your note.
> 
> The fighter's [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) hits, and you select the low end of high HP: 36. Well, now it's 25. Your note says "Per +8, AC 18, HP 25." If it gets to take a turn, you can give it a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) then.

### Saving Throws
<sup>GMG p. 62</sup>

You can often set saves quickly by assigning one high, one moderate, and one low modifier. Some creatures might vary from this, either because they have poor AC but better saves or because they should thematically have multiple good saves and compensate elsewhere. You have more flexibility with saves, and having one save off the listed number by 1 is rarely a big deal. Pay attention to the creature's Con, Dex, and Wis modifiersâ€”these don't have to correspond to the creature's saves exactly, but should inform your choices.

Extreme saves often pair with extreme or high ability modifiers. Almost no creature should have more than one extreme save, even at high levels. Assign terrible saves to creatures that have a clear weak pointâ€”for example, a nearly immobile creature would have a terrible Reflex save.

| Level | Extreme | High | Moderate | Low | Terrible |

| â€“1 | +9 | +8 | +5 | +2 | +0 |
| 0 | +10 | +9 | +6 | +3 | +1 |

| 24 | +46 | +42 | +38 | +36 | +32 |

### Hit Points
<sup>GMG p. 62</sup>

Give a creature HP in the moderate range unless its theme strongly suggests it should use another range. Spellcasters, for example, often have low HP. Brutish creatures usually have high HP, compensating with lower AC, weaker saves, few tactical options, or other limitations. As mentioned in the Armor Class section above, you don't want a creature with extreme AC to have high HP too.

Hit Points are closely tied in with immunities, weaknesses, and resistances, so if your creature has any of those, look at that section before finalizing HP (page 63)

#### Regeneration and Healing Abilities
<sup>GMG p. 62</sup>

Your creature might have regeneration, fast healing, or some other ability to heal itself. These healing abilities can greatly affect the flow of a fight. Regeneration or fast healing heals some number of hits each roundâ€”usually one to one and a half hits. To determine the number of Hit Points it should restore, look at the high damage value on Table 2â€“10: [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) Damage (page 65) and multiply that value by the number of hits healed. For instance, if the high damage is 20, regeneration between 20 to 30 makes sense. The value should be higher if the regeneration is easy to overcomeâ€”and remember that most regeneration gets easier to overcome at higher levels. Also, you might want to decrease the creature's total HP by double its regeneration value. Fast healing follows the same rules, but because it can't prevent a creature's death and there isn't always have a way to deactivate it, you might want to give the creature more HP instead of fast healing to keep things simple.

If a creature can use an ability that heals it, that ability typically restores more HP since it costs actions. An at-will healing ability should be based on a _heal_ spell 2 levels lower than the highest-level spell a creature of that level could ordinarily cast (for example, an 11th-level creature can typically cast up to 6th-level spells, so you would base its healing ability on a 4th-level _heal_ spell). If the ability both deals damage and heals, use that same baseline scale from above but with _vampiric touch_ instead of _heal_

### Immunities, Weaknesses, and Resistances
<sup>GMG p. 63</sup>

If it's highly thematic for a creature to have an immunity, weakness, or resistance, consider adding it. Table 2â€“8 lists the ranges for weaknesses and resistances by level.

Immunities are generally reserved for creatures made of an unusual substance (like a fire elemental being immune to fire). You can also give an immunity if a creature's biology or construction would logically cause it to be unaffected (like a mindless creature's immunity to [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effects)

If the creature should be hard to affect with something but the conditions above aren't true, give it a resistance instead. For instance, a giant octopus isn't actually made of cold water, so it wouldn't be immune to cold, but its life in the ocean depths make it resistant to cold. You'll typically use the lower end of the value on Table 2â€“8 for a broad resistance that applies to a wide range of effects, like "physical 5 (except silver)" and the higher end for something narrower, like a single damage type. A creature with a resistance, especially a broad resistance or a physical resistance, usually has fewer HP.

Giving your creature a weakness adds flavor to it and greatly rewards effective player tactics once your players identify the weakness. The weakness should apply to one damage type or phenomenon and use the high end of the scale. Creatures typically have at most one weakness. If a creature has a weakness, especially to something common, give it additional HP. The amount of additional HP might depend on how tough the creature should feel if the PCs don't exploit its weakness; a tough creature might have additional HP equal to quadruple the weakness value.

A creature with a hard-to-exploit weakness might have additional HP equal to the weakness value or less.

| Level | Maximum | Minimum |
|-------|---------|---------|
| â€“1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 3 | 1 |
| 1 | 3 | 2 |
| 2 | 5 | 2 |
| 3 | 6 | 3 |
| 4 | 7 | 4 |
| 5 | 8 | 4 |
| 6 | 9 | 5 |
| 7 | 10 | 5 |
| 8 | 11 | 6 |
| 9 | 12 | 6 |
| 10 | 13 | 7 |
| 11 | 14 | 7 |
| 12 | 15 | 8 |
| 13 | 16 | 8 |
| 14 | 17 | 9 |
| 15 | 18 | 9 |
| 16 | 19 | 9 |
| 17 | 19 | 10 |
| 18 | 20 | 10 |
| 19 | 21 | 11 |
| 20 | 22 | 11 |
| 21 | 23 | 12 |
| 22 | 24 | 12 |
| 23 | 25 | 13 |
| 24 | 26 | 13 |

The combination of more HP and a weakness has a different feel from standard HP with resistances. If the creature being an impervious tank really fits its theme, use a resistance with an exception, such as "physical 5 (except silver)." If, however, it makes more sense for normal hits to get through and the creature to simply have great staying power, use more HP and a weakness. Skeletons and zombies are a good example of the difference between these styles. Skeletons have resistances because they're bony and hard to hurt. Zombies, on the other hand, have more HP and a weakness to slashing damageâ€”they're tougher, but their bodies aren't built to deflect weapon attacks, and slashing attacks can rip them up quickly.

### Speed
<sup>GMG p. 64</sup>

Your creature's Speed should be 25 feet if it moves like a human. Beyond that, you can set the Speed to whatever makes sense. Remember that the creature can move up to triple this number if it spends its whole turn moving, so if you want the PCs to be able to chase the creature, its Speed can be only so high. Creatures at higher levels need ways to deal with flying PCs, speedy PCs, and PCs with more efficient actions that let them engage and retreat more easily. This might mean adding a fly Speed, giving the creature ranged attacks, and so forth.

Creatures can have climb and swim Speeds even at low levels. While you can give your creature a fly Speed at those low levels, it's better to wait until around 7th level (when PCs gain access to _fly_) to give your creature a fly Speed if it also has ranged attacks or another way to harry the PCs from a distance indefinitely.

### Strikes
<sup>GMG p. 64</sup>

When building your creature's selection of [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), use the following sections to set the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md)'s attack bonus and damage. Give the attack all the normal traits if it's a weapon; for unarmed attacks or weapons you invent, give whatever traits you feel are appropriate. Note that these traits might influence the damage you give the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).

You might want to make sure a creature has an unarmed attack if you think it's likely to get disarmed. At 7th level and higher, PCs might have the ability to fly, which makes it more important for creatures to have decent ranged [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) to make sure they aren't totally hopeless against flying PCs (though they could instead have fast fly Speeds or something similar)

#### Strike Attack Bonus
<sup>GMG p. 64</sup>

Use a high attack bonus for combat creaturesâ€”fighter typesâ€”that also usually have high damage. A creature could have a higher attack bonus and lower damage, or vice versa (for instance, a moderate attack bonus and extreme damage might fit a creature that's more like a barbarian), instead of having a poor statistic in another category. Spellcasters typically have poor attack bonuses, potentially in exchange for extreme spell DCs.

#### Strike Damage
<sup>GMG p. 64</sup>

Table 2â€“10 on the next page gives the damage a creature should deal with a single [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). You might use a lower category if the creature has better accuracy, or a higher category if its accuracy is lower.

A creature that's meant to be primarily a combat threat uses high damage for its melee [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), or moderate for melee [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) that have the [agile](rules/traits/agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait") trait. Ranged attacks more typically use the moderate value, or even low. A creature that's meant to be highly damaging uses the extreme damage values, but might then have a moderate attack bonus. As with most statistics, extreme damage is more likely at higher levels. You can also use the extreme value for special attacks that the creature can use only a limited number of times or under circumstances that aren't likely to happen every round.

More versatile creatures, such as ones that can cast some spells and aren't meant to primarily get their damage through [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), go one category lower: moderate for their main melee [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), low for agile and ranged [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md).

Spellcasters and other creatures that aren't meant to be competent in a direct fight might use the low damage value, or even less if they completely don't care about their [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md).

On Table 2â€“10, you'll find a damage expression (a die roll or rolls plus a flat modifier) you can use as is, or you can take the damage in parentheses and build your own damage expression to hit that number. If you do the latter, remember that a d4 counts as 2.5 damage, a d6 as 3.5, a d8 as 4.5, a d10 as 5.5, and a d12 as 6.5. Usually a damage expression works best when roughly half the damage is from dice and half is from the flat modifier. If your creature deals special damage, like `1d6` fire from flaming attacks, that counts toward its total damage per [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). Keep in mind that a creature using a weapon should have a damage value that feels right for that weapon. Extreme damage works well for two-handed weapons that uses d10s or d12s for damage. On the other hand, a dagger uses only d4s, so a dagger wielder would need something like sneak attack to deal extreme damage, or you might compensate for the dagger's lower damage per [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) by giving the creature the ability to attack more efficiently or use other tricks.

> [!pf2-brown] MANUFACTURED WEAPONS
> 
> As noted in Items on page 61, most creatures have less treasure than PCs, so those that rely on manufactured weapons are significantly weaker if you don't adjust the weapons' damage to compensate. The method for determining [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) damage on page 64 abstracts over the sources of damage so you don't have to worry about adjusting the weapon's damage. If you do decide to calculate the weapon's damage, give your creature weapon specialization or greater weapon specialization much earlier than a PC would get it. You might also need to add sneak attack or similar abilities to make the creature deal more damage.
> 
> On the flip side, you might want to use a one-off creature as a source of a particularly high-level piece of treasure, such as a magic weapon. In these cases, you might want to make the attack bonus higher for the potency rune or the damage higher for a potent striking rune so the PCs feel the weapon's effect before they obtain it. This will make the treasure feel more powerful, since they've already been on the receiving end.

### Spells
<sup>GMG p. 65</sup>

Your creature might have magical abilities that are best represented by spells. If you're making a highly spellcasting-themed creature, give it prepared or spontaneous spells. For a creature that has spells due to its magical nature, especially if that magic isn't its core focus, consider giving it some innate spells instead.

How many spells you should give a creature depends on how you expect it to spend its actions in combat. If it's primarily going to be making [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md), it might not have any spells, or it might just have a few to help it move around better or protect against certain types of magic.

When choosing spells, lean hard into the creature's theme. While many PCs choose spells to cover a wide variety of situations, creatures are more evocative the more focused they are. Consider selecting about three-quarters of the spells based on relevance to the theme and the remainder for other things. However, make sure the spells aren't one noteâ€”selecting _fireball_ for most of a creature's spell slots doesn't make for a compelling fire creature in the way a diverse selection of fire spells would.

When choosing spells, some spells won't be very useful if cast at an extremely low level compared to the creature's levels. Most notably, damaging spells drop off in usefulness for a creature that's expected to last only a single fight. A damaging spell 2 levels below the highest level a creature of that level can cast is still potentially useful, but beyond that, don't bother. Spells that have the [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait") trait should be in the highest level slot if you want the creature to potentially get their full effect against PCs.

#### Spell Dc and Spell Attack Roll
<sup>GMG p. 65</sup>

Set the creature's spell DC and spell attack roll using Table 2â€“11 on page 66. Most creatures use the same DC for all their spells, even if they have multiple types, such as a creature with both prepared spells and innate spells.

Use the high numbers for primary casters, and the moderate numbers for creatures that have some supplemental spells but are focused more on combat.

At 15th level and higher, the extreme numbers become standard for spellcasters. A few creatures might use the extreme numbers at lower levels, but they tend to be highly specialized, with very weak defenses and [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md).

Secondary spellcasters can go up to high numbers if they're above 15th level and have offensive spells. There is no low valueâ€”the creature shouldn't have any spells in the first place if it would be that bad at using them!

#### Prepared and Spontaneous Spells
<sup>GMG p. 66</sup>

Spell slots work best for creatures that are meant to play like PC spellcasters. Choose the magical tradition best suited to the creature. You aren't strictly limited to that tradition's spell list, though sticking close to it will make your creature's connection to that tradition more clear. The decision to use prepared or spontaneous spellcasting should align with the creature's theme: a spontaneous spellcaster fits well as a one-off creature, since spontaneous spellcasting grants greater flexibility in the middle of battle, while a prepared spellcaster makes for a great recurring character who can change their spells between appearances.

For a creature that can cast as many spells as a PC spellcaster, the highest spell level the creature can cast is half its level rounded up. It gets five cantrips. If the creature's level is odd, it gets two spell slots of the highest spell level (plus three spell slots of each lower level), or three spell slots of that level (plus four spell slots of each lower level). If its level is even, it gets three spell slots of the highest spell level (plus three spell slots of each lower level), or four spell slots of that level (plus four spell slots of each lower level)

Because creatures tend to be "on stage" for only a short time, you usually don't need to fill every spell slot. You can often fill just the top three levels of spells, pick cantrips, and slot in a few thematic backup spells in the fourth level down.

For a recurring foe, you might give it a full complement.

#### Innate Spells
<sup>GMG p. 66</sup>

Unlike prepared and spontaneous spells, innate spells can be of higher level than half the creature's level rounded up, and you can choose how often they're usedâ€”they can even be used at will or be constant effects. The most notable innate spells tend to be top-level ones that make a big impact but can be used only once, at-will spells that strongly reinforce the creature's theme, and constant spells that give it an ongoing benefit. A spell that's usable a limited number of times and falls at a lower level than the top tier is typically less likely to come up in combat; however, that's a great spot for utility and recovery spells, such as _dispel magic_ or _restoration_

Sometimes a strongly thematic innate spell is of a higher level than the creature would normally be able to cast, but it's so fitting that it belongs there. Be careful when doing this, as PCs might not have access to the appropriate countermeasures for the spell. This option works best for support, action denial, or battlefield control spells that change the odds of a fight without outright killing anyone, such as the succubus's _dominate_ spell. These should make the fight more interesting, not end it. Keep the number of such spells very low, typically just one.

Though you can achieve all sorts of things with innate spells, always start with the theme and an idea of how you want the creature spending its actions. And though you could give the creature a tool to counter every kind of PC attack or trick, remember that the players chose those options to enjoy using them, rather than to be constantly foiled by an effectively invincible creature.

#### Rituals
<sup>GMG p. 67</sup>

Since rituals happen during downtime, giving them to a creature is usually a purely thematic choice. You can skip even looking at rituals in most cases. If you decide a creature needs to have a ritual for your story, add in the ritual whenever you need it.

> [!pf2-brown] FOCUS SPELLS
> 
> Some creatures have focus spells, especially when those focus spells clearly fit a creature's theme. Simply give the creature the focus spells you like and between 1 and 3 Focus Points (you can also allow your creature to cast focus spells using spell slots). Use the same DC and spell attack roll as any other spell.
> 
> A creature that has just 1 Focus Point is likely to cast a focus spell only once, unless it's a recurring enemy. If the creature has plenty of spells already, you might want to skip focus spells altogether, as they aren't as strong as top-level spell slots.

### Design Abilities
<sup>GMG p. 67</sup>

In this step, you'll take the ideas for abilities you noted when you developed your concept and design these abilities for your creature. You can look at existing creature abilities from the _Bestiary_ and feats from the _Core Rulebook_ and use them as is or modify them to fit your needs.

When choosing abilities, think about both the number of abilities and the diversity of abilities. Having a large number of similar abilities can make the creature tougher to run, and it probably can't use them all anyway. Diversity of abilities gives the creature different ways to act in different situations, and helps guide you as the GM. For instance, a combat creature might have one ability it uses to get into position, another to use when it wants to focus damage on a single enemy, and a third that's more defensive.

#### Basics of Ability Design
<sup>GMG p. 67</sup>

There are a few principles of ability construction that you'll want to keep in mind. Some guidance for specific types of abilities will come later, but these apply to everything.

- Respect the action economy.
- Make sure abilities are level appropriate.
- Avoid "invisible" abilities.

##### Action Economy
<sup>GMG p. 67</sup>

Understanding a creature's action economy is key for making it work in play. Remember how short the lifespan of a typical combat creature is. Including a bunch of combat abilities might mean you spend time building actions the creature will never have time to use. Narrow your selections down to the smallest and most compelling set that makes sense. Also keep in mind that special actions will compete for time with any combat spells you gave the creature.

Reactions can help, giving the creature a way to act when it's not its turn. See Reactive Abilities on page 69 for advice on designing these tricky abilities.

Because of PC capabilities at higher levels, creatures at those levels should get more abilities that improve their action economy. For instance, creatures that grapple should have [Improved Grab](rules/abilities/improved-grab.md) instead of Grab, Speeds should be higher, and many abilities that would have cost an action at a lower level should be free actions.

##### Level Appropriateness
<sup>GMG p. 67</sup>

The effects of an ability should be appropriate to the creature's level. For damaging abilities, that means they follow the damage guidelines on page 68. For others, take a look at spells and feats with a similar effect to see if they're level appropriate. For instance, say you're considering giving a 6th-level creature the ability to teleport a short distance. _Dimension door_ is comparableâ€”that's a 4th-level spell, normally cast by a 7th-level or higher creature. That means 6th level probably isn't too low, but the creature shouldn't be able to use the ability more than once. You can also compare your creature to those in a _Bestiary_ volume to see if the special abilities seem similar in power to those of other creatures of the same level.

##### Invisible Abilities
<sup>GMG p. 68</sup>

Avoid abilities that do nothing but change the creature's math, also known as "[invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) abilities." These alter a creature's statistics in a way that's [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) to the players, which makes the creature less engaging because the players don't see it using its abilities in a tangible or evocative way. For example, an ability that allows a creature to use an action to increase its accuracy for the round with no outward sign (or worse, just grants a passive bonus to its accuracy) isn't that compelling, whereas one that increases its damage by lighting its arrows on fire is noticeable.

These both work toward the same goalâ€”dealing more damage this roundâ€”but one is far more memorable.

#### Active Abilities
<sup>GMG p. 68</sup>

Abilities a creature uses on its turn have the most flexibility and scope. You can use Table 2â€“11 to determine active ability DCs as well as spell DCs. You can have an ability use 1 to 3 actions as needed (or be a free action in rare cases) and use just about any type of tactic. Feats, spells, and existing creature abilities provide a wide variety of examples, so look for something similar to your idea to use as a basis.

Consider how you want your creature to spend its turns.

Two-action activities pretty much define the creature's turn, and single actions work best for supplemental benefits or normal [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md). And as you build out your idea of a creature's turn, don't forget about movement! A creature often needs to spend actions getting into position, especially early in a fight. This is especially challenging with meleeonly creatures. You can give such creatures abilities similar to Sudden Charge or the deadly mantis's Leaping Grab.

Use 3-action abilities sparingly, as a creature can't use them if it is [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) or [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned)â€”making a creature's coolest or most defining ability use up 3 actions might mean the creature never gets to use it. These activities should be reserved for abilities that include some movement (like Trample) or that the creature is likely to use before engaging in combat. Don't make an ability use 3 actions as a way to balance itâ€”saying "This can be more powerful than other abilities because it is less likely to work," is a recipe for frustration if you've made a cool ability that's too hard or even impossible for the creature to use.

Be especially careful with activities when designing boss creatures. They're likely to get targeted with the PCs' most powerful detrimental effects, get [grabbed](rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), become [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed), or otherwise have their actions restricted. Bosses need to have solid options they can use with 1 or 2 actions.

This lets them use their remaining actions to get away, use a simple ability, or otherwise keep the fight dynamic.

##### Free Actions
<sup>GMG p. 68</sup>

Use free actions that don't have triggers sparingly, and when you do, they should almost always be used for support or utility actions, not [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) or movement. If you come up with a free action, consider whether it should be its own action or part of a combo, such as drawing a weapon and attacking. In cases like the latter, you might be better off making a single action that allows the creature to draw a weapon and then [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md).

##### Damage-Dealing Abilities
<sup>GMG p. 68</sup>

If a special action is a single action with only one target, you can often set damage using Table 2â€“10: [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) Damage on page 65. If it uses more than 1 action or requires setup in some way, it might deal higher damage than is typical; often, you can just use the extreme column in these cases.

For abilities that deal damage in an area, use Table 2â€“12 below. These numbers are based on a 2-action activity (e.g., most damaging spells). Single actions should deal much less damage. An ability that has another significant effect, like applying a condition, should deal less damage; for this, look at the damage for 2 or more levels lower, and judge which value would best match based on the severity of the additional effect. These abilities typically allow a basic saving throw. The table includes values for unlimited-use abilities (ones that can be used at-will) and limited-use ones (which can be used once or, like a Breath Weapon, once or twice but not on consecutive turns)

You can use the dice given or generate your own expression based on the damage in parentheses, as detailed in the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) Damage section on page 64. If a high-level effect has a small area compared to similar abilities, you have it deal more damage.

| Level | Unlimited Use | Limited Use |

| 23 | `11d6` (38) | `24d6` (84) |
| 24 | `11d6` (39) | `25d6` (88) |

#### Defensive Abilities
<sup>GMG p. 69</sup>

Active offensive abilities usually fit creatures better than defensive abilities do. Save defense increases for creatures that are strongly defense-themed. For martial creatures, something as simple as a shield and [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) is usually plenty. Defensive abilities often run the risk of being [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) abilities. For examples of good defensive abilities, look at spells like _sanctuary_ for ideas, or other spells that create interesting protective effects instead of just granting a bonus. If you do want to make a creature defensive, pick one defensive ability rather than several, since stacking up multiple defenses can make for a frustrating fight. One solid style of defensive ability is a mode switch, which causes the creature to get stronger defenses, but limits its attacks, spells, or other offensive options.

#### Reactive Abilities
<sup>GMG p. 69</sup>

Reactions and free actions with triggers can give a creature an impact outside its turn. This can make the fight more interesting, but may also be risky. It's tempting to give every creature a reaction, but that's not necessarily a good idea.

To decide whether your creature should have a reaction, first consider if the creature has the reflexes or insight to react well in the first placeâ€”for instance, an ogre doesn't have [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md) because it's a big oaf. Oozes, constructs, and unintelligent creatures are less likely to have reactions than others for this reason.

Second, look at the complexity of the encounter your creature is likely to appear in. If you'll have a large number of creatures, skipping reactions can make the fight flow faster. A creature that's more likely to fight solo, on the other hand, might have a reaction to give it a way to continue to be dangerous amid an onslaught of attacks by the party.

When creating reactions, be careful with "gotcha" abilitiesâ€”ones that punish players for making perfectly reasonable choices, for rolling poorly, and so on. If you include abilities like this, they need to reinforce the creature's core theme and the play style you want it to use in combat. For example, a creature that [Strikes](rules/actions/strike.md) as a reaction when someone fails an attack roll will encourage PCs to use their actions on other tactics, rather than attacking multiple times each turn. Is that what you want? Is this dynamic essential for making the creature feel like it's supposed to? This isn't the type of ability you'd give to any old creatureâ€” only an incredible duelist or something similar.

Reactions should require something out of the ordinary to happen, or should be relatively weak if triggered by something ordinary. A reaction that triggers anytime someone tries to [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) a creature is likely to be perceived by the players as uninteresting because it's so predictable.

The best reactions should be telegraphed so when they happen, it makes sense to the players. Think of one of the core reactions of the game: [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md). The creature raises its shieldâ€”an obvious action the PCs can seeâ€”so when it blocks damage from an attack, that makes perfect sense.

Similarly, if you made a crystalline creature, you might have it build up sonic energy in a low thrum, so when it uses a reaction to release a burst of sonic energy when hit, the players can say, "Oh, I should have seen that coming."

##### Reaction Damage
<sup>GMG p. 69</sup>

Reactions should use lower damage, usually that of a moderate [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). A reaction that deals area damage might deal low damage, though use such reactions with caution.

#### Constant and Automatic Abilities
<sup>GMG p. 69</sup>

Certain abilities shouldn't use any actions. Auras are a common constant ability, with frightful presence, an adult red dragon's dragon heat, and a xulgath's stench as notable examples. An aura needs a range, and if it needs a DC, you'll usually set it to the moderate spell DC unless the aura is one of the creature's defining concepts. For example, the xulgath's stench DC is significantly higher because the aura is such an iconic part of the creature.

Abilities the creature has no control over should be automatic. For example, the living wildfire fire elemental explodes into flame when it dies. It has no option not to, so this wouldn't make sense as a reaction or free action.

Conversely, the Ferocity ability is a reaction because it requires the creature to give itself a last push to stay at 1 HP.

##### Constant and Automatic Damage
<sup>GMG p. 69</sup>

Much like for reactions, damage for a constant ability should be pretty low. Usually this value is just below low [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) damage. Automatic abilities like the living wildfire's explosion ability tend to deal moderate [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) damage or unlimited-use area damage, and can deal even more if they happen only after the creature is dead or otherwise no longer presents a threat.

#### Skill Abilities
<sup>GMG p. 69</sup>

A skilled creature might have abilities related to its skills.

The skill feats in the _Core Rulebook_ make for a good baseline. Avoid giving your creature skill abilities that won't matter in its interactions with PCs.

### Review Holistically
<sup>GMG p. 69</sup>

Now it's time to look over your completed creature as a whole and make sure it's living up to your concept. Can it do everything you wanted? Does it fit its intended role? Is there anything you could add or anything superfluous you could cut to get the creature where it needs to be? If this creature is built for combat, run through a few turns in your head. Does it still work decently if it gets [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed)? Can it move into combat against the PCs effectively given their mobility options compared to its own? Does it have any abilities it'll never use given its other actions? When you're satisfied with your creation, it's ready to hit the table. But that's not necessarily the end! If you notice issues during the game, you can fix them on the spot. It's your game, and you can freely change what you wrote if you think differently later on.

### Trait Abilities
<sup>GMG p. 70</sup>

Creatures with certain traits tend to have similar abilities to one another. Many of them appear here, to help you make your creatures match the theme of the trait when you build your own creatures.

### Designing Npcs
<sup>GMG p. 72</sup>

Creatures that are meant to cleave closely to character classes or intended to represent people rather than monsters are NPCs. They might face more scrutiny around their mechanics than creatures, because a player can more directly compare their rogue to an NPC who acts like a rogue. That doesn't mean you have to build an NPC exactly like a PC, though.

You can build NPCs just like you would any other creatures. If an NPC should work like they have a class, use the class features and feats of a suitable class to pick abilities, and look at both the class's proficiencies and ability modifiers to determine how strong the NPC's statistics should be. Class Road Maps on page 73 has prebuilt road maps for the _Core Rulebook_ classes to get you started.

If the NPC isn't meant to work like they have a class (a baker, for example), instead look at the NPC Gallery on pages 202â€“249. Compare your NPC to the existing ones to determine the NPC's level, and look for abilities that are similar to what yours should have. You can also create new abilities as needed to get the NPC's interactions with the PCs to express their theme and role in the story. These NPCs can be level â€“1 or level 0. Their capabilities are below those of PCs, and they should typically not use any class features or feats from PC classes. Creatures of these levels tend to be extremely simple, and usually you can just take one from the NPC Gallery and reskin it.

It's highly recommended that you select NPC skills using proficiency ranks as you would a PC, though you don't need to be precise about the number of skill increases you give the NPC. You can give them earlier access to expert, master, or legendary proficiency if they're a skill-based NPC, and better proficiency in narrow areas of expertise, like [Engineering Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) for a tinker NPC.

#### Non-Combat Level
<sup>GMG p. 72</sup>

An NPC's level should represent their combat prowess.

A common person might not be a combat threat, even if they're important or highly skilled, and they consequently have a low level. However, that doesn't mean they can't present a challenge in other types of encounters. This is represented by a non-combat level, and tends to be specific to their area of expertise. For example, the barrister on page 232 of the NPC Gallery is a 4th-level creature in an encounter related to legal matters.

This can go the other way as well, such as with a powerful combat creature that's not suited to social settings. This is usually the case with creatures untrained in mental skills. You can improvise this as you run the game, or you can plan ahead if you have something particular in mind.

Building an NPC's non-combat level is pretty simple.

Choose the level you want the NPC to be for the type of challenge you have in mind, and use the skill numbers for that levelâ€”typically high or even extreme. Some challenges, such as social challenges, require the creature to have a high [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) and Will DC, so in those cases, you should increase those values as well. These should be set at the moderate or high values for the non-combat level, usually, depending on how adept you want the NPC to be.

The Experience Points gained for besting an NPC depend on how the party overcame them, because XP comes from overcoming a specific challenge. If the PCs defeat the NPC in a non-combat setting of the NPC's specialty, the party gets XP based on the NPC's non-combat level. If they just beat the NPC up, the XP would be based on the NPC's creature level. Quite often, that means 0 XP and failure at the PCs' objective; for instance, during a baking contest, if the PCs murder the other baker, not only would they be disqualified, but they would likely be apprehended for their crime.

#### Pc-Style Build
<sup>GMG p. 72</sup>

If you do choose to build an NPC fully using the PC rules, your NPC should generally end up being an appropriate challenge as a creature of their level. They will likely have lower statistics in some areas than if you had built them using the creature rules, but more options due to their full complement of feats and class features. This is best saved for important, recurring NPCs, especially if they're meant to engage in social or exploration endeavors rather than just battles. There are still some considerations and shortcuts that can expedite the process while ensuring the NPC works as you intend.

- The creature's treasure should follow the Treasure for New Characters rules on page 510 of the _Core Rulebook_. You'll need to account for this in your campaign's overall treasure. You might even want to give the NPC a higher-level item appropriate as a treasure allotment for the level.
- You can expedite ability score generation by making the starting ability modifiers add up to +9, with no more than one modifier at +4 (and typically no more than one negative modifier). You can skip adding a background if you do this, but you might want to give the creature two skills, which includes one [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill, to represent the skills granted by a background.
- It's not necessary to assign every skill feat, particularly for a higher-level NPC. You can just pick the most emblematic ones and gloss over the rest.
- For general feats, Incredible Initiative and Toughness make good choices.
- Most of the guidelines about choosing spells still apply, though you might want a few more utility spells that deal with non-combat challenges, particularly in low-level slots.

## Building Hazards
<sup>GMG p. 74</sup>

### Concept
<sup>GMG p. 74</sup>

The first thing you'll need is a concept for your hazard.

What level is your hazard? Will it be simple or complex? Is it a trap, a haunt, an environmental hazard, or something else? If it's a trap, is it mechanical, magical, or both? This is a good time to brainstorm the hazard's name and description, as this will help you decide how the hazard can be disabled.

The following information builds on concepts from Building Creatures, which starts on page 56.

#### Hazard Types
<sup>GMG p. 74</sup>

The three main types of hazards are traps, environmental hazards, and haunts.

Traps are usually built or placed, though they can also form accidentally, such as if a magic portal, through millennia of disuse, malfunctions as its magic warps. Mechanical traps always have some physical component, whereas purely magical traps typically don't. Magical traps can usually be counteracted by _dispel magic_, and those without a listed proficiency rank for [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) can be found using _detect magic_. [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) is the most common skill used to disable traps.

Environmental hazards are either living things, like dangerous spores and molds, or simply features of the terrain or environment, like avalanches or rockslides. While they are always physical, some environmental hazards can't reasonably be attacked or damaged, such as a cloud of poisonous gas or a patch of quicksand. [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) is the most common skill used to disable environmental hazards.

Haunts are spiritual hazards, usually formed when the spiritual essence of a location is imprinted with the instincts and emotions from a living being's demise. Because haunts lack matter, they rarely involve a physical component, and when they do, that component is generally incorporeal or might even be damaged only by positive energy. The skills and options used to disable haunts vary, though using [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) for an exorcism is common. However, even with a successful check to disable a haunt, it can reoccur until its unfinished business is resolved. Typically, successfully disabling or enduring a haunt provides clues to determine what it would take to lay it to rest permanently.

### Understanding and Choosing Statistics
<sup>GMG p. 74</sup>

Much like for creatures, hazard statistics can be extreme, high, or low (hazards don't need as much granularity, so they usually don't have moderate or terrible values for their statistics). While they are defined in creature creation, when building a hazard, you'll use the values slightly differently.

**Extreme:** While extreme values remain world-class statistics that are extremely difficult to meet or exceed, unlike with monsters, almost all hazards have one extreme statistic because hazards normally activate only if they have gone [unnoticed](rules/conditions.md#Unnoticed) or if someone critically failed to disable them. Does it have an extreme [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) DC that makes it incredibly hard to find, an extreme Disable DC that makes it perilous to disable, or an extreme save DC that makes it deadly in the event it triggers? These are the most common choices, as each affects a different phase of encountering the hazard.

**High:** This is a capable level, and can generally serve as a baseline value; this value for hazards covers what would be the high and moderate ranges for creatures.

**Low:** If a hazard has a weakness, like a poor Reflex save for a bulky mechanical trap or an easy DC to disable for a hard-to-find trap, it usually has a low value. If you need something even lower, use a terrible value from Building Creatures (pages 56â€“73), or just an incredibly low value.

### Stealth and Disable
<sup>GMG p. 75</sup>

When determining a hazard's combat statistics, first decide how the hazard can be located and how hard it is to disable.

A hazard where the main challenge is how difficult it is to find, like the _Core Rulebook's_ [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) pit, might have a very different effect for its level than a hazard out in plain sight, daring a PC to try to disable it, like the _Armageddon orb_

| Level | Extreme | High | Low |
|-------|---------|------|-----|
| â€“1 | 18 | 15 | 12 to 11 |
| 0 | 19 | 16 | 13 to 12 |
| 1 | 20 | 17 | 14 to 13 |
| 2 | 21 | 18 | 15 to 14 |
| 3 | 23 | 20 | 17 to 15 |
| 4 | 25 | 22 | 18 to 17 |
| 5 | 26 | 23 | 20 to 18 |
| 6 | 28 | 25 | 21 to 19 |
| 7 | 30 | 27 | 23 to 21 |
| 8 | 31 | 28 | 24 to 22 |
| 9 | 33 | 30 | 26 to 23 |
| 10 | 35 | 32 | 27 to 25 |
| 11 | 36 | 33 | 29 to 26 |
| 12 | 38 | 35 | 30 to 27 |
| 13 | 40 | 37 | 32 to 29 |
| 14 | 41 | 38 | 33 to 30 |
| 15 | 43 | 40 | 35 to 31 |
| 16 | 45 | 42 | 36 to 33 |
| 17 | 46 | 43 | 38 to 34 |
| 18 | 48 | 45 | 39 to 35 |
| 19 | 50 | 47 | 41 to 37 |
| 20 | 51 | 48 | 42 to 38 |
| 21 | 53 | 50 | 44 to 39 |
| 22 | 55 | 52 | 45 to 41 |
| 23 | 56 | 53 | 46 to 42 |
| 24 | 58 | 55 | 48 to 43 |

When deciding how your hazard is disabled, come up with a narrative description of how it would happen, which will inform which methods and skills disable the hazard. You'll need to decide the proficiency rank necessary to find the hazard as well as disable it with each method.

Remember, a hazard without a listed rank next to its [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) DC is obvious enough that creatures can find it without [Searching](rules/actions/search.md), and magical hazards without a listed rank are not normally protected against _detect magic_. Most hazards built by intelligent creatures are [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) have at least a trained rank. Table 2â€“14 indicates the high and moderate proficiency requirements by level; you can use lower proficiency ranks than the ones listed, and if you use the high rank, consider a secondary, perhaps less-efficient method to disable the hazard using a lower rank. For instance, the bloodthirsty urge haunt in the _Core Rulebook_ can be disabled with master [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion), or by a higher DC with expert [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy).

If you need a [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) modifier for a complex hazard, just subtract 10 from the listed DC.

| Levels | High | Moderate |
|--------|------|----------|
| 0 or lower | Untrained | Untrained |
| 1-4 | Trained (expert for [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception)) | Trained |
| 5-8 | Expert | Trained |
| 9-18 | Master | Expert |
| 19 or higher | Legendary | Master |

### Defenses
<sup>GMG p. 75</sup>

If there's a physical component that a character could break, you'll need to determine the hazard's AC, Fortitude save, and Reflex save, using the extreme, high, and low values (preceded by E, H, or L on the table) as well as its Hardness, HP, and Broken Threshold (BT). When building a purely magical or formless hazard, you can skip this section.

| 24 | 54 | 51 | 48 | +46 | +42 | +36 | 46â€“50 | 180â€“188 |

* The Broken Threshold is usually half the hazard's HP.

Some hazards, even high-level ones, don't make sense with a high Hardness value. In those cases, you can skip the Hardness and use the HP values from table 2â€“7: Hit Points on page 63. Especially for complex hazards, you might want to divide the durability over multiple sections, located in different positions, to encourage teamwork and mobility.

### Offense
<sup>GMG p. 76</sup>

Almost all hazards need an attack bonus or a save DC, and hazards that deal damage need to list a damage value. Simple hazards deal about twice as much damage as complex hazards and have an attack bonus even higher than the extreme attack bonus for a creature (abbreviated as S. Atk in Table 2â€“16: Offense). Complex hazards usually have attack bonuses akin to a high attack bonus for a creature (abbreviated as C. Atk in Table 2â€“16). You can adjust them further using Table 2â€“9: Attack Bonus on page 64 if your hazard needs it. Simple hazard DCs aren't as high for their level as their attack bonuses are, since effects with DCs usually have some effect even on a successful saving throw; use the EDC and HDC columns for extreme and hard DCs on Table 2â€“16: Offense below.

The damage columns on the table give a damage expression you can use, followed by the average damage in parentheses. If you want to make your own damage expression, remember that average damage is 2.5 for a d4, 3.5 for a d6, 4.5 for a d8, 5.5 for a d10, and 6.5 for a d12.

#### Designing Simple Hazards
<sup>GMG p. 76</sup>

When designing a simple hazard, make sure to select an appropriate trigger and effect. Often, a simple hazard that merely damages its target is little more than a speed bump that slows down the game without much added value, so think about the purpose of your hazard carefully, both in the story and in the game world, especially when it's a hazard that a creature intentionally built or placed in that location. A great simple hazard does something interesting, has a longer-lasting consequence, or integrates with the nearby inhabitants or even the encounters in some way (you can find more information on integrating hazards with encounters in Dynamic Encounters on page 48)

#### Designing Complex Hazards
<sup>GMG p. 76</sup>

Unlike a simple hazard, a complex hazard can play the part of a creature in a battle, or can be an encounter all its own. Many of the concerns with damaging effects when designing a simple hazard don't apply when designing a complex hazard. A complex hazard can apply its damage over and over again, eventually killing its hapless victim, and isn't intended to be a quick-to-overcome obstacle.

Complex hazards have a lot more in common with creatures than simple hazards do, and you'll see that a complex hazard's statistics are similar to those of a creature.

A good complex hazard often requires disabling multiple components or otherwise interacting with the encounter in some way. For instance, while the _Core Rulebook's_ poisoned dart gallery requires only one [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check to disable, the control panel is on the far end of the gallery, so a PC would need to make their way across first.

##### Building Routines
<sup>GMG p. 76</sup>

A complex hazard has a routine each round, whether it stems from preprogrammed instructions built into a trap, instincts and residual emotions swirling around a complex haunt, or a force of nature like sinking in quicksand. Make sure to build a routine that makes sense for the hazard; an environmental lava chute that ejects lava into the area each round shouldn't be able to seek out and precisely target only the PCs, but it might spatter random areas within range or everything within range, depending on how you describe the hazard. However, a complex haunt might be able to recognize life force and target living creatures.

If you create a hazard that can't consistently attack the PCs (like the _Core Rulebook's_ blade pillar, which moves in a random direction), you can make it deadlier than normal in other ways.

The hazard should have as many actions as you feel it needs to perform its routine. If you split the routine out into several actions, you can also remove some of the hazard's actions once partial progress is made in disabling or destroying it; this can give the PCs a feeling of progress, and it can encourage them to handle the hazard if it appears in a encounter alongside creatures.

### Simple Hazards
<sup>GMG p. 77</sup>

A simple hazard uses its reaction when triggered.

### Complex Hazards
<sup>GMG p. 80</sup>

Complex hazards roll initiative and act on their turn.

## Building Items
<sup>GMG p. 82</sup>

New items make great mementos of previous adventures and tend to be one of the easiest elements for a character to begin using mid-campaign after receiving them as a reward. This section explains the philosophy and numbers behind creating items so you can design your own in no time!

### Concept and Role
<sup>GMG p. 82</sup>

First, come up with a concept for the item based on the role the item serves in your game and in the game's world. You might include a new item in an ancient ruin to hint at the its history and the people who used to live there. For instance, a Thassilonian ruin might have an item based on rune magic, while a Jistkan ruin might have an item related to golems.

A new magic item might be important later in the story, or its role might be as simple as a fun wolf-themed item for the monk that uses Wolf Stance. Keep your concept in mind to guide you through the rest of the process. Start thinking about what kind of magic item it will be. Each item type has its own niche, and some are less likely to be as useful to the PCs. For instance, new weapons and armor require the PC to give up the weapon or armor they already have, which might make them more reluctant to use the new items unless they're noticeably better, while consumable items don't have as big an impact on the story as permanent items.

#### Item Level
<sup>GMG p. 82</sup>

A new item is typically going to be within a few levels of the PCs. If it's too low, it might not be interesting, and if it's too high, it might be too powerful or too lucrative to sell.

#### Comparison
<sup>GMG p. 82</sup>

First, take a look at similar items. For example, if you want a permanent item that lets someone fly, look at the _broom of flying_, which moves of its own volition to a location and thus can't be used to gain a huge advantage during combat, and _winged boots_, which can. This will give you an idea of the right level range and the different specifics and limitations of existing items. You might even be able to just adjust one of those a bit to get what you want with minimal work.

### Item Effects
<sup>GMG p. 82</sup>

Next, use the item's concept and role to decide its effects. This is where your creativity will bring the item to life. Make sure to have it do something exciting and roleplay-inspiring. A magic item that does nothing more than deliver a bonus is far less interesting, even if the item does have a load-bearing item bonus, like a magic weapon. To determine the item's power, take into account the special abilities you give the item as well as the item bonus (if any) that it grants.

For specific advice for the type of magic item you are creating, check out Designing by Type on page 83.

#### Special Abilities
<sup>GMG p. 82</sup>

When deciding what special abilities are appropriate for what level, it's best to look for similar spells to gauge the effect. For most consumables, the effect should be less powerful than the highest level spell a spellcaster of the item's level could cast. Scrolls are about the most efficient you can getâ€”they're the same level the spellcaster would beâ€”but they require a spellcaster that has the spell on their list, and take the same actions as casting the spell normally.

The most straightforward choice is a once-per-day ability. For this, the item's level should be at least 2 levels higher than the minimum level a spellcaster could first cast that spell. For example, if your ability is about as powerful as a 3rd-level spell cast once per day (perhaps [haste](compendium/spells/haste.md)), then it should be at least a 7th-level item. A basic wand is a good example. However, a wand is flexible and can contain the most effective possible choice for its spell level (such as long-lasting spells where once a day is effectively permanent), so a specific item that doesn't grant such a spell could have additional powers or bonuses at the same price as a wand.

If the item can be activated multiple times per day, it should be at least 4 levels higher insteadâ€”9th level in our example. Frequency could range from twice per day to once per hour and anything in between. Choose whatever makes sense to allow the characters to use the item more frequently without being effectively constant or unlimited. The appropriate frequency, or whether it's ever okay to have unlimited activations, varies wildly based on the spell. Unlimited castings of a cantrip is fine, but an effect akin to a non-cantrip spell is rarely a good idea. Only attempt to build such an item when you're certain of the consequences.

Items that can be activated less often than once per day don't appear too often, and they usually fit best with abilities that make sense outside of encounters. It's still best to stick to the guidelines for once-per-day abilities, but these items tend to have more propertiesâ€”and often strange ones.

##### Constant Abilities
<sup>GMG p. 82</sup>

If you want an effect to be constant, set the level and Price accordingly. For instance, let's say your group is 16th level and you want to give them an item themed around flying.

A 7th-level [fly](compendium/spells/fly.md) spell lasts an hour already, so one casting covers a significant portion of the adventuring day. To keep it simpler, you decide to create a 16th-level cloak that lets the wearer constantly fly. Remember, some effects were never meant to be constant and could warp your game.

##### Activation Actions
<sup>GMG p. 83</sup>

Watch out when picking the number of actions an activation takes! A 1-action activation that casts a spell with a 2-action casting time is drastically more powerful in an encounter than an item with a 2-action activation would be. An item like that is typically much higher level, and it works best with "helper" spells or ones with limited utility rather than offensive spells. The safest bet is to use the same number of actions the spell normally takes to cast.

##### Scaling Out of Usefulness
<sup>GMG p. 83</sup>

Some spells aren't appealing if their level is too low. For instance, an item that casts 1st-level _burning hands_ three times per day might be 5th or 6th level. The problem is that spell scaling has the biggest impact at low levels, so the spell isn't effective compared to other actions a character could take. Err on the side of fewer, more impressive activations.

#### Bonuses
<sup>GMG p. 83</sup>

If your item includes item bonuses, check the table below for the minimum item levels the game's math expects permanent bonuses to be applied to. A lower-level item might give such a bonus temporarily, but keep track to make sure the item isn't effectively permanent. If a character typically picks three or fewer locks a day, there's no difference between a +2 item bonus to pick all locks and an activation that gives a +2 item bonus to [Pick a Lock](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md) three times per day.

For attack bonuses, AC, and saves, the minimums match _magic weapons_ and _magic armor_. You can have other items with these bonuses (like _handwraps of mighty blows_), but keep in mind they compete with fundamental runes.

Skill bonuses come on a wider range of items. Some are more broadly useful, so an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) item might be more expensive than an equivalent [Society](compendium/skills.md#Society) item. Gaining a bonus to [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) is especially valuable compared to gaining a bonus to a skill. Just because an item is the minimum level for its bonus doesn't mean the bonus should be the item's only power. The item can and should have an additional interesting power beyond the bonus. Likewise, an item can come at a higher level than the minimum, but if it's much higher, its abilities start to compete with the next bonus.

| Statistic | +1 | +2 | +3 |
|-----------|----|----|----|
| Attack Bonus | 2 | 10 | 16 |
| AC | 5 | 11 | 18 |
| Save (resilient rune) | 8 | 14 | 20 |
| Skill/Perception | 3 | 9 | 17* |

* This is also the minimum level for apex items.

### Designing by Type
<sup>GMG p. 83</sup>

The following guidance applies to items of various types.

#### Alchemical Items
<sup>GMG p. 83</sup>

Alchemical items are consumables. Because alchemists can make a large number for free, alchemical items tend to be on the weaker end for their level, with lower Prices. Avoid [alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait") effects that feel too much like magic. Alchemy is capable of fantastical things, but should have its own distinct feel; where you draw the line depends on your game.

Alchemical bombs are like weapons for alchemists and should usually primarily deal damage, with small extra effects. Existing bombs are great models. Elixirs are varied; make sure not to duplicate potions, especially highly magical ones. Be careful with mutagen drawbacks; it's easy to make one that doesn't affect certain characters. Look at the serene mutagen. If its drawback didn't affect spells, Wisdom-based casters who didn't use weapons would have no drawback.

Poisons are one of the trickier alchemical items to make, and it's usually best to just tweak one found in the _Core Rulebook_ to avoid making something that's overpowered; compare to poisons of the same type that have similar onset and stage duration, as longer onset and duration poisons tend to deal drastically more damage. Alchemical tools are best used for adding a little weirdness. They can be especially creative and interesting, but tend not to be powerful.

#### Ammunition
<sup>GMG p. 83</sup>

Magic ammunition is consumable; launching it destroys it. Pay attention to whether you give the ammunition an activation: any big flashy effect for its level should almost always have one, since otherwise the effect is essentially a free action on top of a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). This is particularly important for extremely low-level ammunition, since a high-level character could use that ammunition for every [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) without noticing the gold cost. If the ammunition doesn't deal normal [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) damage on a hit, remember to say that! Dealing damage is the default.

#### Armor and Weapons
<sup>GMG p. 83</sup>

Specific armor and weapons replace the opportunity to add property runes, so you have a lot of space to design. Choose abilities that feel attached to the fact that they are weapons or armor; for instance, a fiery sword that you point at an enemy to shoot fire bolts is more on theme than a fiery sword that casts _wall of fire_ in an unconnected way.

The specific item should cost more than the base armor or weapon would with just the fundamental runes, but you can often discount the cost of the additional components significantly as part of the specific item's special niche. Be careful about specific armor or weapons that include property runes in addition to unique specific abilities. If you discount the item, you might end up with an item significantly superior to one built using the normal property runes system. That's not always bad, since it's still giving up customization for power, and this can be appropriate if the item has an important place in your story. Just make sure the difference isn't too drastic.

If you just want to create armor or a weapon with runes and no extra special abilities, you can do so. The Price of such an item is the sum of all the runes' Prices, and its level is that of the highest-level rune on the item.

When picking abilities, you can also consider taking from the relic gifts found on pages 96â€“105. Even if your game doesn't use relics, that section has plenty of choices sorted by theme. If you do, keep in mind that relic abilities are typically more powerful than usual for their level and that those abilities wouldn't scale on a normal magic item.

#### Held Items
<sup>GMG p. 84</sup>

Usually, held items should require manipulation to use, with [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) activations. They are most often tools, implements, items that can be thrown, and the like. Imagine a PC physically using the item and what that looks like.

Remember that held items are more challenging for martial characters to use, compared to spellcasters or hands-free characters, like monks. A barbarian might have to give up a two-handed weapon to use a held item, and so is less likely to use one. This means you might want to design held items specifically for non-martial characters, or have them be items a martial character uses outside of combat.

#### Oils
<sup>GMG p. 84</sup>

Oils are consumables you slather onto items or, rarely, creatures. They provide an interesting opportunity to apply effects to other items. Just remember not to accidentally make something that should be applied topically into a potion; for instance, a [petrified](rules/conditions.md#Petrified) character can't drink an anti-petrifying potion! The actions an oil takes to use depend on how thoroughly it needs to be applied. For one used outside of combat, it could take a minute or more.

#### Potions
<sup>GMG p. 84</sup>

Potions are consumables in the truest sense; you literally consume them. Since the action of drinking isn't easy to split up, they take only a single action to activate. This advantage makes potions that replicate spell effects incredibly powerful, and it's the reason potions are nearly always higher level than scrolls with similar effects.

#### Runes
<sup>GMG p. 84</sup>

Property runes are a fun and versatile way to customize weapons and armor without throwing away the previous items. Each should be fairly simple, especially at lower levels, because combining runes can make things overcomplicated. Compare to other properties to determine the right level.

#### Scrolls
<sup>GMG p. 84</sup>

You'll never need to design a new scroll, but use them as a comparison when designing other types of consumables. If you're designing a consumable that seems like it's much better than a scroll of its levelâ€”or faster to activateâ€”you should probably raise the item's level or adjust the effect.

#### Shields
<sup>GMG p. 84</sup>

Use the _sturdy shields_ as benchmarks for the best possible shield Hardness, HP, and BT for a shield of that level. Your new shield should have less than those benchmarks since it also does something else, and you can use the magnitude of the reduction to build room for creative defensive abilities.

#### Staves
<sup>GMG p. 84</sup>

You'll need to come up with a theme and curate a list of spells that stay close to that theme, typically one to three per spell level, all on one spell list. A staff is always at least 3 levels higher than the minimum level for a spellcaster to cast the highest-level spell it contains, so a staff with up to 4th-level spells would be at least a 10th-level item.

#### Structures
<sup>GMG p. 84</sup>

Structures are evocative and make great tertiary items, quirky but not part of a combat build. This allows you to price them affordably, but make sure there isn't some [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) abuse where the structure drastically alters encounters. The [structure](rules/traits/structure.md "Structure General Trait") trait is intended to help as a starting point.

#### Talismans
<sup>GMG p. 84</sup>

Because talismans are affixed ahead of time but don't take an action to retrieve, they reward forethought and planning. Those that can be activated as a free action also have the best action efficiency of any consumable. In the same way scrolls reward specific spellcasters, talisman requirements reward particular types of characters. Talismans might grant a single use of a feat, with an additional effect if the character already has that feat. Think of talismans as martial characters' answer to scrolls to expand on the options of the non-spellcasters at your table.

#### Wands
<sup>GMG p. 84</sup>

You won't need to design basic _magic wands_, but you might want a special wand. When designing a new special wand, your wand's level will usually be 1 to 2 levels higher than the basic wand, depending on the magnitude of the special effect. Remember that if you make the wand 2 levels higher, it's now competing with wands of a spell a whole level higher, so the special effect should be worth that cost!

#### Worn Items
<sup>GMG p. 84</sup>

Worn items vary wildly in their effects, but they all take up one of a character's 10 invested items. Remember to include the item's worn entry, if applicable (or â€” if you could imagine someone wearing 10 or more with no difficulty)

> [!pf2-brown] POTIONS VS. ELIXIRS
> 
> Alchemical items and magic items follow a similar price economy based on their level, but the effects of potions can be a bit broader and more directly magical. Alchemists can also make extremely large numbers of elixirs at an item level equal to their alchemist level, so if a 17th level elixir was competing with a 9th level spell for power, an alchemist would be packing the equivalent of over 40 9th level spells, and potentially [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) spells thanks to the single action activation.

Where the item is worn should usually match its effects or bonuses: shoes help you move, eyepieces affect your vision, and so on. As with held items, imagine a character wearing the item to picture how they use its magic.

Apex items are always at least level 17 and should have unique abilities on top of their bonus, just like other items.

### Fill in the Numbers
<sup>GMG p. 85</sup>

You're almost done! The final step is to fill in the numbers.

#### Dcs
<sup>GMG p. 85</sup>

Choose any DCs for the item's abilities. You can't go wrong with the typical DCs in Table 2â€“18. However, an item with a narrow function might have a DC up to 2 higher, and one that forces a save (such as with an aura) is typically 2 lower.

The lower the DC, the quicker the item becomes obsolete.

| Item Level | DC |
|------------|----|
| 1 | 15 |
| 2 | 16 |
| 3 | 17 |
| 4 | 18 |
| 5 | 19 |
| 6 | 20 |
| 7 | 23 |
| 8 | 24 |
| 9 | 25 |

| 17 | 37 |
| 18 | 38 |
| 19 | 41 |
| 20 | 43 |

#### Item Prices
<sup>GMG p. 85</sup>

Use the following guidelines for pricing items.

##### Permanent Items
<sup>GMG p. 85</sup>

Each item level has a price range. Based on the item's role and abilities, decide where in that range to place it. There's plenty of variation, and you primarily need to worry about Price only if you expect the PCs will be able to sell it.

Primary items cost near the highest value for their level.

They have a big impact on combat or player ability. This includes weapons, armor, and [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) items. The highest price is for items like _magic weapons_, _magic armor_, and apex items. So a _+1 striking weapon_ is 100 gp at 4th level.

Secondary items, with middle values, give significant secondary benefits or enhance highly consequential noncombat or support skills like [Medicine](compendium/skills.md#Medicine) or [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting).

Tertiary items, with low value, are weird or very specific items, ones not usually core to a character's build.

Especially strange ones might fall into the gap between two levels.

| Level | Price | Core Item |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | 10â€“20 gp |  |
| 2 | 25â€“35 gp |  +1 weapon |
| 3 | 45â€“60 gp |  +1 skill item |
| 4 | 75â€“100 gp |  +1 striking weapon |
| 5 | 125â€“160 gp |  +1 armor |
| 6 | 200â€“250 gp |  |
| 7 | 300â€“360 gp |  |
| 8 | 415â€“500 gp |  +1 resilient armor |
| 9 | 575â€“700 gp |  +2 skill item |
| 10 | 820â€“1,000 gp |  +2 striking weapon |
| 11 | 1,160â€“1,400 gp |  +2 resilient armor |
| 12 | 1,640â€“2,000 gp |  +2 greater striking weapon |
| 13 | 2,400â€“3,000 gp |  |
| 14 | 3,600â€“4,500 gp |  +2 greater resilient armor |
| 15 | 5,300â€“6,500 gp |  |
| 16 | 7,900â€“10,000 gp |  +3 greater striking weapon |
| 17 | 12,000â€“15,000 gp |  +3 skill item, apex item |
| 18 | 18,600â€“24,000 gp |  +3 greater resilient armor |
| 19 | 30,400â€“40,000 gp |  +3 superior striking weapon |
| 20 | 52,000â€“70,000 gp |  +3 superior resilient armor |

#### Consumables
<sup>GMG p. 85</sup>

Consumables have a slightly narrower range, with topend items like scrolls, optimum healing potions, or super-useful consumables like a _potion of invisibility_ at the high end.

| Level | Price |
|-------|-------|
| 1 | 3â€“4 gp |
| 2 | 5â€“7 gp |
| 3 | 8â€“12 gp |
| 4 | 13â€“20 gp |
| 5 | 21â€“30 gp |
| 6 | 31â€“50 gp |
| 7 | 51â€“70 gp |
| 8 | 71â€“100 gp |
| 9 | 101â€“150 gp |
| 10 | 151â€“200 gp |
| 11 | 201â€“300 gp |
| 12 | 301â€“400 gp |
| 13 | 401â€“600 gp |
| 14 | 601â€“900 gp |
| 15 | 901â€“1,300 gp |
| 16 | 1,301â€“2,000 gp |
| 17 | 2,001â€“3,000 gp |
| 18 | 3,001â€“5,000 gp |
| 19 | 5,001â€“8,000 gp |
| 20 | 8,001â€“14,000 gp |

## Item Quirks
<sup>GMG p. 86</sup>

You can use the table found here to quickly apply a quirk to any item, such as items found as treasure or new items that a PC creates. Rather than rolling, you can instead choose one yourself or invent a new quirk. Item quirks don't normally have any mechanical effect, since their only purpose is to be colorful and further flesh out the world, though you can add one if you so choose. Such effects should never grant more than a +1 item bonus or â€“1 item penalty, and even then the statistic or check it applies to should be narrow. For a quirk that grants an item the ability to speak, you choose the language based on the history of the item, or your best guess of what that history might be. It's typically a language spoken by the item's creator.

## Intelligent Items
<sup>GMG p. 88</sup>

Intelligent items are a special kind of magic item that straddles the line between treasure and NPC. An intelligent item might be another type of item as well: it could be an artifact (like _Serithtial_ on page 112), a cursed item (page 90), or even a relic (page 94) that grows with its wielder.

Introducing an intelligent item is an effective way to subtly alter the party dynamic. An intelligent item works well when its personality makes it a natural complement or foil for its partner: the PC investing, holding, or otherwise interacting with the item. An intelligent item that can communicate only with that particular PC is also a great way to engage players who are a bit quieter, or those slower to speak in a scene where all the PCs can talk to a particular NPC. Due to their inherently limited agency, intelligent items are at less of a risk for stealing the spotlight than other NPCs who travel along with the party.

### Intelligent Item Rules
<sup>GMG p. 88</sup>

Every intelligent item has the [intelligent](rules/traits/intelligent-gmg.md "Intelligent Item Trait") trait. Intelligent items can't be crafted by normal meansâ€”typically an accident, a divine act, or a major sacrifice on the part of the creator is required to grant the item the mental essence it needs for sentience, and in some rare cases the spiritual essence it needs to have a soul of its own.

Because of this, intelligent items are always rare or unique. The normal statistics and rules for wearing or using an item of its type still apply to an intelligent item. In addition, intelligent items have a few statistics other items lack.

#### Alignment
<sup>GMG p. 88</sup>

An intelligent item always has an alignment trait, just like any other creature, even if it isn't fully sapient. Few intelligent items are capable of growing and changing their alignment and fundamental nature; most are fixed at the time of their creation.

#### Perception and Senses
<sup>GMG p. 88</sup>

An intelligent item that has any sense of the world around them has a [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) modifier. Intelligent items have only the senses listed within their entry, rather than the assumed assortment of senses that most creatures have. If an intelligent item notices something its partner doesn't, it might be able to communicate with its partner and let them know.

#### Communication and Languages
<sup>GMG p. 88</sup>

Intelligent items almost always have some means of communicationâ€”an easy way to demonstrate an item's intelligence! The most common ways are via empathy, speech, and telepathy. Speech and telepathy function as they do for any creature, while an empathic connection allows the item to share only emotions. Empathic and telepathic connections are often limited either to the item's partner or to a certain distance.

If an intelligent item understands or speaks any languages, they are listed in parentheses in its Communication entry. If the item doesn't have speech listed, it can only understand the listed languages, not speak them.

#### Skills
<sup>GMG p. 88</sup>

Intelligent items might have skill modifiers for Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma-based skills that fit their nature.

#### Ability Scores
<sup>GMG p. 88</sup>

Intelligent items have Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, though as inanimate objects, they don't have Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution entries.

#### Will Save
<sup>GMG p. 88</sup>

Since they have their own minds, intelligent items might be subject to [mental](rules/traits/mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effects that require a Will save.

### Item Agency
<sup>GMG p. 88</sup>

As a default, intelligent items have control over all their own magic, meaning an intelligent magic weapon could deny the effects of its fundamental and property runes if it so chose, and intelligent items perform their own activations when they wish. Intelligent items can typically use 3 actions per turn, acting on their partner's turn. These actions don't count toward their partner's 3 actions. They have a reaction if any of their activations requires one.

Beyond denying magic effects and communicating their displeasure, intelligent items can usually influence or hinder their partners only in subtle ways. If the item is a weapon or tool necessary for an action (like thieves' tools), it can at least be disruptive enough to make its partner take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to associated checks, much as if the partner were using an improvised weapon or tool. If an intelligent item can have a greater effect, such as seizing control of its partner's body for a time, the intelligent item's entry includes those abilities.

### Designing Intelligent Items
<sup>GMG p. 89</sup>

When you first set out to create an intelligent item, ask yourself what role you expect the item will play in your game. Unlike any other item, the intelligent item is a character of its own and adds to the group dynamic, usually in ways similar to a minor NPC who follows the party throughout the adventure. That means it's important to have a clear role in mind. Is the item an ally in the PCs' dangerous quest? A kindred spirit and confidante? A foil for the PC? A morally ambiguous ally worth handling for its great power? Or perhaps a bit of comic relief? Once you know what you want in the item, you can develop its personality and abilities in parallel, coming up with thematic links between them.

When choosing values for the intelligent item's statistics, you'll often want to use values suitable for a creature of its level. You could use much lower values if you want to give it a weakness, but keep in mind that a low Will modifier might make it particularly easy to control, which could be a problem if it can make life miserable for its partner. Because the item can usually activate its abilities on its own, the intelligent item is essentially adding a limited additional character to the PCs' team, so consider its effect on the encounters the PCs face. For example, a high-level normal item that lets a PC cast a 3rd-level _fireball_ every round might be reasonable given that it counts toward the PC's available actions, but an intelligent item is adding that _fireball_ on top of everything else the PCs can do.

### Specific Intelligent Items
<sup>GMG p. 89</sup>

The following, as well as the intelligent artifact _Serithtial_ on page 112, are a few example intelligent items to get you started.

## Cursed Items
<sup>GMG p. 90</sup>

Cursed items are almost never made intentionally; even those who set out to curse an item find the task incredibly difficult or even impossible. These items are the results of magical mishaps, shoddy crafting, or sinister forces interfering with the creation. Many specify how their curses work, but curses are fickle, and you as the GM determine how curses play out in your game. Due to these factors, an item with the [cursed](rules/traits/cursed-gmg.md "Cursed Item Trait") trait is always rare.

**Identifying Cursed Items:** Cursed items often appear to be ordinary magical items, as the magic that warps their function also disguises their curses from detection. Unless you roll a critical success when Identifying a cursed item, it simply appears as something [helpful](rules/conditions.md#Helpful) or benign. A critical success reveals both the presence of the curse and the exact nature of the curse.

**Removing Cursed Items:** Many cursed items can't be discarded. Some use magic to fuse to the wielder, making it impossible to remove the item, while others attune to their owner and return even if discarded. (This section uses the term "fuse" to describe either situation.) In many cases, this feature reveals itself only after the cursed item has been triggered for the first time or after investing the item for the first time, allowing the user to develop a false sense of security. Fused cursed items can be removed by targeting the item's owner with a _remove curse_ spell or similar magic. If the spell is successful, the item can be discarded, but nothing prevents the item from cursing the same creature again if the conditions are met, so it's best to dispose of the item quickly. Invested cursed items that can't be removed continue to count against a character's invested items, even without reinvesting them each day.

### Specific Cursed Items
<sup>GMG p. 90</sup>

The following are a few examples of cursed items.

> [!pf2-note]
> Please visit the items page to view all cursed items.

### Item Curses
<sup>GMG p. 92</sup>

Most curses alter a base item. Item curses alter their base item, much like a property rune, though they can't be detected or identified unless a creature critically succeeds at a check to Identify the Item. A curse can be applied to the specific types of magic items listed in its Usage entry.

Curses typically can't be removed or transferred from the item, though at your discretion, either might be possible after the curse is [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken). If the PCs manage to break the curse, the newly uncursed item could be quite valuable.

> [!pf2-note]
> Please visit the items page to view all item curses.

## Relics
<sup>GMG p. 94</sup>

Relics begin as a simple item, called a relic seed, which is little more than a functional item with a minor [magical](rules/traits/magical.md "Magical Item Trait") effect associated with it. As the owner of the relic grows in power, so does the relic. It develops gifts, which are new magical abilities and activations. These abilities might be themed to the relic, the character, or the nature of the campaign. If a relic is passed to another character, this process begins anew, sometimes granting the same abilities again over time, but possibly unlocking entirely new powers. If someone else takes the relic from its owner, it usually works for a while, though it might lose its power incrementally over time if not returned to its owner. How the relic changes in such a circumstance is up to you, and should fit the story.

The decision to add relics to the game is entirely up to you as the GM. If you decide to add them, you'll need to adjust treasure somewhat. It's also wise to consider how many players you expect to end up with relics. Will they each get one? Or will there be just one or two tied to the theme of the campaign?

### Discovering a Relic
<sup>GMG p. 94</sup>

Some relics might begin as ordinary items with a rich history. They might be part of a character's starting gear, only to have their true powers uncovered later during play.

Other relics can be acquired during play as part of the ongoing story. Regardless of their origin, these powerful items might not appear to be much at first, but they contain the potential to become something truly great.

For example, an old, tarnished amulet found around the neck of a buried king might turn out to be an item of deep historical significance that awakens to great power.

The seemingly ordinary family sword, passed down to each new generation, might unlock [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) potential through the deeds of its owner.

The PCs might immediately recognize a relic for its ability, or they might carry it for a time before its true nature becomes apparent. The story of a relic should be a tale of discovery. At first, a relic's wielder likely does not fully understand the item's power, or might be unable to use it, learning of its abilities only after a momentous event or fortuitous breakthrough. Ultimately, relics are powerful tools in service of the story, working as a valuable tie to the narrative, but their growth and development are in your hands. Because of the place relics hold in the story, they aren't available for purchase, nor can they be crafted.

Pay attention to the characters' backstories for potential relics, and look for spots in your narrative that might be suitable for campaign relics. If you're planning to use relics in your game, let the players know in advance, since their ideas and plans can guide you and give them greater investment in the relics.

#### Background Relics
<sup>GMG p. 94</sup>

A background relic is tied to the history of a character, and its form and abilities should draw inspiration from the story of their character's life or the past of the item.

The relic could be a gift from a friend or mentor, an heirloom from the character's family, a found object from their upbringing, or even the first item they ever crafted. The player should select the form of the relic (a battered longsword, a copper ring, or a threadbare red cloak, for example)

#### Campaign Relics
<sup>GMG p. 94</sup>

A campaign relic is drawn from the ongoing story of the campaign. You decide the entirety of the item, from its form to its aspects (described below) as part of the story of the campaign. Use campaign relics to reinforce and foreshadow the themes of your game. Relics come to those who need them to do great deeds, after all, so finding a relic with the perfect aspects for your future challenges is entirely likely. Unlike background relics, campaign relics typically have magical abilities when first found.

### Relic Aspects
<sup>GMG p. 95</sup>

Each relic is associated with aspectsâ€”typically twoâ€”that speak to its overall concept and purpose. The individual gifts each have an associated aspect. You should almost always select gifts that have an aspect matching one of those found on the relic. For example, a brass dagger recovered from the City of Brass might have the fire and mind aspects, which means that it could have the flare bolt gift (which has the fire aspect), but not the rolling geode gift (which has the earth aspect)

Usually you can determine at least one aspect of a relic easily by looking at the history of the item or personality of the character. For example, if a player decides that their background relic is a rusty mace wielded by the character's great grandmother in battle against rising undead hordes, the mace might have the life aspect, as it was used to slay countless undead creatures. There's no harm in letting the player choose an aspect for a background relic; through play, the item will reveal another aspect associated with it. In the previous example, the mace might reveal itself to have powers against demons as well, in which case its aspects might be celestial and life.

### Advancing a Relic
<sup>GMG p. 95</sup>

As a relic's bearer performs mighty deeds and advances their story, the relic gets stronger. The most basic advancement for a relic is its level, which always matches that of its owner. Weapons and armor can gain fundamental runes normally. You decide what, if any, property runes can be added to a given relic; by default, they can't have property runes, like any other specific item.

The more complex advancement comes from gifts.

[Table 2â€“22: Relic Gifts](rules/tables/relic-gifts-gmg.md) shows the typical number of gifts a relic should have at a given level, but relics don't follow this strictly. Rather, gifts arise according to the pace of the story, the needs of the campaign, and the relationship between the character and the relic. Generally speaking, this results in a relic gaining one gift for every 4 levels its bearer has, but this might fluctuate as the campaign progresses. For example, a relic might gain its first gift at 4th level after the bearer defeats a powerful foe. It might then gain its second at 7th, after they perform a special ritual. That same relic might not gain another gift until 13th level and then again at 16th as the player reaches other major milestones.

The gift typesâ€”minor, major, and grandâ€”indicate their general power level. Again, the table indicates what's generally appropriate at certain levels, but you can alter them as you see fit. You should usually avoid giving a minor gift at 10th level or higher, because it just won't be that impressive, though some of them scale well enough to be interesting at higher levels. The Gold Piece Equivalent entry for each gift helps you determine how much you should reduce treasure when using relics (see Adjusting Treasure below)

![Relic Gifts](rules/tables/relic-gifts-gmg.md)

You decide what gifts a relic gains, generally by either selecting a single gift or offering two paths for the relic to grow and allowing the player to choose, but this should be informed by the story and the nature of the character bearing the relic. A relic should complement the bearer, bolstering the bearer's strengths and helping to overcome their weaknesses. Within that framework, you should try to maintain a cohesive theme for the relic.

### Adjusting Treasure
<sup>GMG p. 95</sup>

When you incorporate relics into your game, you can adjust the treasure gained by the party down to account for the relics increasing in power. Essentially, some of the treasure from [Table 10â€“9: Party Treasure by Level](rules/tables/party-treasure-by-level.md) on page 509 of the _Core Rulebook_ should be replaced with relic seeds and gifts instead. You can use the relic's minimum level, replacing a permanent item of that level, or you can use the gp equivalent. Keep in mind that relic gifts are often a little more powerful than other items with the same Price even when they start out, and they often scale without any additional costs, so PCs with relics will usually be a bit more powerful.

If you prefer, you can grant relics in addition to other rewards. This means PCs will be much more powerful, but you're rewarding their investment in the story.

### Making Relic Seeds
<sup>GMG p. 95</sup>

A relic seed can be quite simple: imagine a standard item with two aspects and an appearance that matches the theme. You can also use an existing magic item for a campaign relic; pick two aspects for it, and tweak its appearance or characteristics to make it clearly different from other items of its type. You can choose a tradition for the seed and apply that trait to the seed and all the gifts of the seed. This tradition might be derived from the background of the item, or it might appear or change through story moments involving the relic.

If you want a relic to have an additional special benefit, you can design it to grant a bonus to a skill, typically a +1 item bonus for a 3rd-level relic.

> [!pf2-brown] Player-Driven Relics
> 
> Though these rules assume you as the GM are providing relic gifts as a form of treasure with input from the players, you can instead have the players make all the decisions for their relics. Encourage the players to choose different styles of items and aspects to match their characters' themes, rather than simply choosing the most powerful combination of options. Have players describe how their relic gets more powerful in the story. What acts from previous sessions lent the relic power? What special meditations or practices did they perform to unlock new gifts? How does it feel to have the relic grow?
> 
> As the item and the character level up, the player chooses which gifts the item gets from the list as a part of character advancement. You still adjust treasure as normal for incorporating relics into your game. In fact, if the player tries to optimize the combinations, they will likely be more powerful than under the standard method.

### Relic Gifts
<sup>GMG p. 96</sup>

Gifts are divided up into three tiers. Minor gifts grant useful, often scaling abilities and are available early in a character's career. Major gifts define a relic, determining its true purpose and granting powerful abilities. Grand gifts are the pinnacle of power, and most relics never have more than one.

The more gifts there are of one aspect, the more the relic reflects that aspect, and the more influence the aspect has on the character who wields it. An item with multiple shadow gifts might begin to lose its color. With four or five, the character that wields it might take on an ashen tone and the relic might become entirely made of shadow.

#### Gift Saves and Spell Attack Rolls
<sup>GMG p. 96</sup>

Many gifts allow for a saving throw or have other abilities that change as the relic goes up in level. The DC for any saving throw called for by a gift is its owner's class DC or spell DC. The spell attack modifier of a gift is 10 lower than that DC. A relic's counteract modifier is equal to its owner's counteract modifier.

> [!pf2-note]
> Please visit the relic gifts page to view all relic gifts.

> [!pf2-brown] Runes as Gifts
> 
> You can substitute runes for gifts. If you choose to allow property runes on the relic, you'll want them to take up rune slots. Otherwise, you can give as many or few as you prefer, just like any other gifts. Runes are sorted into minor, major, and grand categories, but you should use their normal level and Price when you adjust treasure, instead of the number and levels on the [Table 2â€“22](rules/tables/relic-gifts-gmg.md). If you're using the player-driven relics variant, it's recommended you do not include this option.

## Artifacts
<sup>GMG p. 106</sup>

Stranger and more powerful than other magic items, artifacts can change the course of history in the right handsâ€”or the wrong hands. Simply finding an artifact is a pivotal moment in your campaign, and its presence then ripples throughout your entire game, warping the story around it. Some entire adventures revolve around one artifact! Adding an artifact to your game should never be taken lightly. Artifacts shouldn't be found in normal treasure hoards, even at 20th level, and you'll need to structure moments in your plot that play into the artifact's presence.

Prepare yourself for encounters being easily overcome by the artifact. That doesn't mean you shouldn't include such encounters, since part of the thrill of an artifact is that it breaks the normal rules! Though you should include an artifact mindfully, you should allow it to have its full impact so that it can do itself and the story of your game justice.

### Artifact Rules
<sup>GMG p. 106</sup>

Every artifact is an item with the [artifact](rules/traits/artifact-gmg.md "Artifact Item Trait") trait. This trait means two things: the item can't be crafted by normal means, and it can't be damaged by normal means.

Artifacts are always rare or unique. The ones found here are all 20th level or higher, which is typical for artifacts.

The other rules for wearing or using the item still apply.

#### Artifact Destruction
<sup>GMG p. 106</sup>

An artifact's stat block usually has a destruction entry.

This details the extraordinary method needed to destroy the item. These entries can be highly specific. It could take completing an entire quest, or even an entire campaign, to finally destroy an artifact. However, the story of your game might require something different, so you can always change an artifact's destruction requirement for your game.

### Creating an Artifact
<sup>GMG p. 106</sup>

Mechanically, an artifact functions in the game just like any other itemâ€”only the scope of its abilities is different. Artifacts can and should do things normal items can't, so you don't need to apply the normal limitations on creating items.

When you're making an artifact, start by defining its role in the story. Is it meant to be a powerful weapon against the forces of darkness? A mercurial force injecting random chance? A terrible danger that needs to be destroyed? The artifact's role in the story affects the features you give it. Come up with some story beats that make sense for the item, then create abilities that enable those moments. An artifact can have more abilities than a typical itemâ€”just make sure they all fit its theme.

Give your item the [artifact](rules/traits/artifact-gmg.md "Artifact Item Trait") trait and either the [rare](rules/traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait") trait (if there multiple items of its kind), or the [unique](rules/traits/unique.md "Unique Rarity Trait") trait (if only one exists). Other traits work like they do for any other item. An artifact is usually 20th level or higher, but its specific level is up to you. Imagine who created it and what their level likely was.

Though you can disregard most of the normal limitations on items, be careful not to create an artifact that will undermine your story. If your item's abilities are so useful or strong that the best option in any battle is to always use the artifact to annihilate the opposition, the artifact has taken over your story instead of serving it. A 5th-level character with access to 10th-level spells through an artifact can lead to incredible stories, but if the DC is so high that enemies are guaranteed to critically fail against those spells except on a natural 20, the item will probably distort play more than you intended. To avoid this, you might set the item's DCs, attack bonuses, and the spell levels of its offensive abilities significantly lower than they would be for an item of its level, especially if they can be used at will. You could also create artifacts that use the wielder's spell DC instead of having their own DC, to make them more broadly usable at a wider range of levels. In addition, an artifact's abilities should be somewhat narrow in their application; aim to make your artifacts very powerful in certain situations, rather than having broadly applicable abilities. For instance, the _orbs of dragonkind_ each work against only a certain kind of dragon, which makes them hugely powerful when facing that one creature, but not against every foe the PCs run across.

### Artifacts
<sup>GMG p. 106</sup>

Countless artifacts have been created over the ages, only a few of which are described here.

> [!pf2-note]
> Please visit the items page to view all artifacts.

## Gems and Art Objects
<sup>GMG p. 114</sup>

Much like coins, gems and art objects are valuable currency worth their full Price when sold. When making a treasure hoard, you can choose gems or art objects you like, or roll randomly using percentile dice.

### Gems
<sup>GMG p. 114</sup>

Gems are naturally occurring minerals, typically in a crystalline form, or, in a few cases, organic material such as amber, coral, and pearls. All but the largest gems weigh about half as much as a coin, so about 2,000 gems is 1 Bulk. Unworked gems are worth half the Price of a finished gem and can serve as the minimum raw materials necessary to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) the finished gem. Lesser semiprecious stones are level 0 items, moderate and greater semiprecious stones are 1st-level items, lesser and moderate precious stones are 4th-level items that require expert proficiency to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md), and greater precious stones are 7th-level items that require master proficiency to [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md).

### Art Objects
<sup>GMG p. 114</sup>

These pieces of artwork have listed values, but might be more valuable to a collector or someone with a personal connection. When including art objects, consider whether the PCs could discover this information and secure a greater reward. For instance, a dwarven crown might be worth 1,000 gp for its exquisite crafting, but even more to the dwarves who lost the crown of their first queen long ago.

This could also be a plot hook for a later adventure.

On the other hand, the materials used to make an art object, such as the paint and the canvas of a painting, are worth far less than the finished object. Some art objects on Table 2â€“24 include uncommon or rare precious materials, though usually not in large enough amounts for other crafting purposes. If you're rolling randomly and don't want to give out an uncommon or rare material, roll again or modify the description (for instance, you might change the mithral crown in the major art objects list to a gold crown)

## Afflictions
<sup>GMG p. 55</sup>

Afflictions strike creatures with potent and often escalating results. This section presents a variety of curses, diseases, and drugs for use in your game. A broad sampling of poisons can be found beginning on page 550 of the _Core Rulebook_, and the rules for afflictions start on 457.

Depending on the tone of the campaign, the GM might want to roll secret saving throws for PCs affected by an affliction. This is particularly effective when the affliction is an element within a survival or horror game, or when it's part of a mystery.

### Curses
<sup>GMG p. 116</sup>

A curse is a manifestation of potent ill will. Curses typically have a single effect that takes place upon a failed saving throw and lasts a specified amount of time, or can be removed only by certain actions a character must perform or conditions they must meet. Rarely, curses will have stages; these follow the rules for afflictions.

Curses may come from a malicious action, such as a lich's Paralyzing Touch or a spell from an evil spellcaster.

Guardians of a tomb or treasure might ward their charge with a curse as protection against thieves. In some rare cases, a curse might manifest as a response to a terrible act, such as a massacre. When using a curse in your game, assign the curse to an item, location, situation, or similar element.

Then, decide on a trigger for the curseâ€”such as a creature attempting to steal a warded book, destroy a work of art, or slay a specific creature. A curse can even be tied to a specific location, in which case it functions as a simple hazard. Once that trigger occurs, the curse affects the triggering creature or creatures. Each affected creature must attempt a saving throw against the curse; if they fail, they are subject to the effects specified in the curse's Effect entry.

### Diseases
<sup>GMG p. 118</sup>

Exposure to disease can be a hazard, such as when PCs come into contact with a plague-ridden corpse; such hazards grant XP as a simple hazard of the disease's level. When a disease gives a [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition that can't be reduced until it runs its course, that typically means the disease has symptoms such as a difficulty swallowing, loss of appetite, or nausea that make eating and drinking difficult but not impossible. Despite the condition's prohibition on eating or drinking, a creature can slowly and carefully eat and drink as long as they aren't in an encounter.

### Drugs
<sup>GMG p. 120</sup>

Drugs offer short-term benefits with harmful side effects and long-term consequences. These short-term benefits, such as euphoria, draw many to drugs, but addiction keeps users hooked long after their first dose. A character can voluntarily fail their initial save against a drug, but for each dose they consume, they must attempt a saving throw against addiction, a disease that represents cravings and withdrawal. Addiction is unique to each drug, so a character can be affected by multiple instances of addiction at once.

Certain drugs alter how addiction works for that drug, adding the [virulent](rules/traits/virulent.md "Virulent Item Trait") trait to the addiction, limiting the maximum stage a character can reach, or adding additional stages beyond those listed in the base affliction.

````ad-embed-disease
title: Addiction, _Disease , level varies_
collapse: closed

Track the maximum stage you reach with each drug's addiction. This maximum stage is separate from your current addiction stage for the drug. The maximum stage can't be reduced, even if you fully remove the disease. When you take the drug, two things happen: you attempt a saving throw against addiction, and you suppress the effects of addiction for 1 day. Failing a save against addiction caused by taking the drug causes you to go to 1 stage higher than the maximum stage you had previously reached (2 stages higher on a critical failure). If you're currently suffering from addiction when you attempt a save from taking the drug, you can't improve your stage; if you succeed at the save, the stage remains the same as it was.

When you attempt your save against addiction each week, the stage you are currently at can't get worseâ€”it can only stay the same or improve. The conditions from addiction can't be removed while you are affected by the addiction, and suppressing addiction by taking the drug only avoids the effectsâ€”it doesn't remove the disease.

```ad-inline-affliction

> [!pf2-brown] DRUGS IN YOUR GAME
> 
> Drugs are socially complex, and including them in your game has the potential to make some of your players uncomfortableâ€”particularly players who have struggled with substance abuse themselves or seen friends and family members go through that struggle. As with any potentially difficult subject matter, you should discuss the role drugs play in your game with your players and ensure that all the players at the table are comfortable with the material; if they aren't, avoid the topic.
> 
> If you do include drugs in your game, consider the role they'll play. In some campaigns, drugs might simply be an element of flavor and a tool characters use to reach their goals; in others, the side effects and risk of addiction might be a terrible price to pay. The rules assume something of a middle path, where drugs are addictive substances that may provide a short-term benefit but have consequences. To make drugs more accessible in your game, remove some of the more severe stages of addiction. To make them more dangerous, add the [virulent](rules/traits/virulent.md "Virulent Item Trait") trait to the addiction affliction, add more stages with increasingly severe effects, or increase the DC of the save against the addiction by 1 for every use of the drug, decreasing back to normal over time as they stop using the drug.

## Building Worlds
<sup>GMG p. 122</sup>

Building your own campaign world can be a deeply fulfilling creative process, as it lets you bring to life the exact setting you envision. It gives you great flexibility, in that you can build only as much as you need for the next few adventures, and you can adapt the world on the fly to meet the demands of your story. It also gives you great control, allowing you to build precisely the setting you need for the story you want to tell. Finally, it bypasses some of the issues that can come with playing within an existing campaign setting, where you might create a narrative that contradicts published canon, or your players might stumble across major plot or setting spoilers. Whatever your world-building goals, this chapter guides you through the design process step by step.

### Design Approach
<sup>GMG p. 122</sup>

World building can be approached in many ways, but it fundamentally comes down to a simple preference. Do you start at a high level and zoom in, or do you start small and build up? This section outlines a largely top-down approach, but you can design from the bottom up simply by starting at the end of this section and working backwards. Either way, you may find yourself skipping between sections as inspiration strikesâ€”and that's OK! When building a world, there's a risk of becoming overwhelmed by the sheer number of decisions to be made. Remember that you don't need to make every decision for every aspect of your world all at once. Focus first on the elements you need for your story and the game, then add as much of the rest as you'd like. You'll also want to allow room for input from your playersâ€” gaming sessions are more memorable and engaging when the storytelling experience is shared between everyone at the table (page 32 has more information on players contributing to the narrative)

Before you decide anything else, however, you should establish your concept and your goals. Do you envision a high-magic steampunk setting where humans are a tiny minority? A world where the only magic derives from squabbling pantheons of gods whose followers are caught up in their wars for power? A quaint town isolated from an otherwise-unknown world beyond a vast, impenetrable forest of mist-choked, skeletal trees? Are you designing a world for a multi-year campaign, or for a fast-paced one-shot adventure? Having an idea in mind will help steer your choices as you build your world, and knowing your goals will help you focus on building what you need.

#### Top Down
<sup>GMG p. 122</sup>

The top-down approach is great if you have a lot of time to dedicate to world building. When designing a setting from the top down, your initial focus is on the big picture.

You may already have an idea of the big movers and shakers of your world or your multiverse. You may want to chronicle a thousand years or more of the setting's history. You may have already sketched out a world map with continents, nations, and trade routes spanning the globe. This approach begins with broad generalities that get more detailed as you design and during play.

#### Bottom Up
<sup>GMG p. 122</sup>

With a bottom-up approach to world building, you start small and local. Focus on the starting location and immediate needs of your campaign, then expand outward as the story unfolds. This strategy works well for those with less time to devote to world building, as you need to prepare only the minimum detail necessary to entice your players toward adventure, fleshing out your world only as the campaign requires it.

### The World
<sup>GMG p. 122</sup>

While world building might include building much more than a single planet, most adventures occur entirely on one world. It's a good idea to have a broad understanding of that world as a whole.

#### Planetary Basics
<sup>GMG p. 122</sup>

When designing the physical features of a campaign world, you'll want to determine its shape and the general distribution of landmasses. You can also establish the world's size, though note the scale of a world generally has a fairly small impact on the adventures taking place there.

##### Shape
<sup>GMG p. 122</sup>

In a fantasy setting, the shape of your world need not be spherical as governed by the laws of physics. It could be any shape you desire, and it need not be a planet at all!

**Globe:** Barring some catastrophe, worlds in our reality are roughly spherical due to the influence of gravity.

**Hollow World:** What if the landmasses and civilizations of a world existed on the inner surface of a hollow sphere? In such a world, the horizon would climb upwards, permitting creatures to see landmarks at extraordinary distances. Light might emanate from a sun-like orb in the world's center, from various other natural or magical sources, or not at all.

**Irregular:** What if your world is flat, a toroid, or shaped into a cylinder, cube, or other polyhedron? What if it's something even stranger? With such an unusual shape, you may need to decide how gravity, atmosphere, and other details function.

##### Landmass
<sup>GMG p. 123</sup>

The next major step in world creation is to sketch out the planet's oceans and major landmasses. On Earth, these geological features are the result of plate tectonics.

In a fantasy world, however, the oceans might have been cleaved from the land by the actions of titans, or the continents shaped to suit a god's whims. The following are some common landmass types.

**Archipelago:** A stretch of vast ocean, dotted by chains of small island groups, atolls, and islets.

**Major Islands:** A region of seas dominated by large islands, each several hundred miles across.

**Island-Continent:** An enormous island nearly the size of a continent, surrounded by ocean.

**Continent:** A substantial landform that (usually) rests on a tectonic plate and gradually shifts in position over geologic timescales.

**Supercontinent:** An assembly of the world's continental blocks into a single immense landmass.

#### Environment
<sup>GMG p. 123</sup>

The environment and terrain of a region can pose as much of a challenge to an adventuring party as any of the foes they face. The following section references the environment categories beginning on page 512 of the _Core Rulebook_

##### Common Environments
<sup>GMG p. 123</sup>

The following environments are common enough that they might appear in nearly any adventure or world.

**Aquatic:** Oceans, seas, lakes, and other large waterways are aquatic environments.

**Arctic:** Arctic environments usually appear near the northern and southern extremes of a world, though extreme elevation, unusually shaped worlds, and supernatural forces could result in arctic terrain elsewhere.

**Desert:** Deserts can appear anywhere on a world where precipitation is scant, even along some oceans. Any large landmasses that entirely lack bodies of water are likely to be deserts.

**Forest:** The composition of a forest depends on the climate and the elevation, with thick jungles more common near an equator, hardwood forests in more temperate zones, and evergreens at higher latitudes and elevations. Most worlds have a tree lineâ€”an elevation above which trees can't grow.

**Mountain:** A world's highest peaks can stretch tens of thousands of feet above sea level. This category also includes hills, which are typically no more than 1,000 feet tall.

**Plains:** Mostly flat and unobstructed, plains are usually at lower elevations, but they can also be found at higher elevation on plateaus.

**Urban:** Cities and settlements are urban environments. These areas are detailed in Settlements, beginning on page 132.

**Swamp:** Wide floodplains, shallow lakes, and marshes can appear at most latitudes.

##### Extreme Environments
<sup>GMG p. 123</sup>

Some adventures lead to fantastic reaches of the world or the multiverse that are seldom tread by mortals.

**Aerial:** A world might include windy realms of floating islands and castles in the clouds.

**Glacier:** Massive sheets of dense ice, constantly moving under their own immense weight, glaciers are frozen wastelands riddled with columns of jagged ice and snow-covered crevasses.

**Volcanic:** Hellish landscapes of molten lava, burning ash, and scorching temperatures pose immediate danger.

**Undersea:** A subset of aquatic environments, undersea environments are those areas submerged beneath the waves.

**Underground:** Some worlds have deep natural caverns, while others have extensive winding tunnels and expansive realms below the surface.

#### Mapping a World
<sup>GMG p. 123</sup>

Many Game Masters like to have an overland map for their local region, nation, or even the whole world. The primary goal of this scale of map is to designate sites of import to the campaign; you need not detail every hamlet or woodland grove, but having a sense of the major features can help you and the other players visualize the world in which they're playing.

**Step 1. Coastlines:** The easiest first step is to separate land from sea. Regional maps may only have a single shoreline, if any. At larger map scales, consider the placement of major islands, archipelago chains, atolls, and islets. A world map should consider the size and placement of continents.

**Step 2. Topography:** Pencil in a rough ridgeline for each mountain range in the region. Mountain ranges are common along coastlines where continental plates push together. If extended into the sea, mountain ranges typically result in a chain of offshore islands. Indicate hills in the regions adjacent to the mountains and elsewhere as necessary to demonstrate elevation. Unmarked terrain on an overland map is usually lowland plains.

**Step 3. Watercourses:** It's important to keep in mind that rivers flow downstream, from high elevation toward the sea, always taking the path of least resistance.

Powerful watercourses might carve canyons or gorges over millennia, but they should never cross through mountain ranges. On a similar note, watercourses don't branchâ€”tributaries join into rivers as they flow downstream.

**Step 4. Terrain and Environment:** Sketch in interesting terrain features such as forests, deserts, or tundra. You may want to differentiate these environs, separating coniferous and deciduous forests from tropical jungles or arctic taiga. Environs not specifically called out on an overland map are typically presumed to be some variety of grassland.

**Step 5. Civilization:** Now you're ready to place the elements of civilization. Major cities should typically be located near fresh water and natural resources. Major roads connect larger settlements, circumventing forests and other difficult environs, but they may wind through mountain passes when lucrative commerce demands it. Add smaller settlements along your roads, further connected by smaller roads and trails. Finally, draw political boundaries and mark other sites of interest.

> [!pf2-brown] CAMPAIGN REFERENCE
> 
> Before the campaign starts, you might want to begin the outline for a campaign reference: a living document that you can easily review and annotate during gameplay and that records the geography, factions, history, characters, and plots central to your campaign.

### Civilization
<sup>GMG p. 124</sup>

With the major geographical features and terrain of your world decided, you'll next want to establish significant nations and settlements.

When it comes to designing a world's cultures, you might want to focus primarily on those areas the party is likely to explore first. This allows you to establish the details and depth of one region's peoples before expanding out to address others. That's not to say you shouldn't have ideas about the cultures beyond your starting settlementâ€”it just means you don't need to decide every detail of every culture all at once.

As always, you don't need to demarcate every realm on the globe or indicate every town, hamlet, and thorp.

Keep your focus on what you need for your story and your adventureâ€”leaving terra incognita can lead to stories down the road as the party ventures further from home.

#### Societal Benchmarks
<sup>GMG p. 124</sup>

The following sections can help you establish certain truths about your world as a whole. From there, you can decide the details of specific cultural groups, including whether they deviate from these global standards.

##### Technology
<sup>GMG p. 124</sup>

Throughout history, a major driver of world culture has been the continuous advancement of technology in warfare, agriculture, and industry. The following categories roughly approximate real-world technological levels, but progress might vary on your world. What heights of technology have been achieved? Have any groups fallen behind or leaped ahead? **Primeval:** Weapons and tools in this early era are crafted primarily from bone, wood, or stone. Knowledge of stonecutting allows early civilizations to raise stone walls and buildings.

**Ancient:** Advancements in mining and metallurgy lead to weapons and tools made from bronze. Crop rotation and storage in granaries ensure greater survival in times of famine. Trade between river and coastal settlements is aided by oar- and sail-powered galleys. Chariots come into strong use during warfare.

**Classical:** Superior military tactics and engineered roads allow for rapid deployment of infantry wielding iron weapons and aided by mounted cavalry. Advances in complex irrigation and construction of aqueducts lead to an abundance of harvest foods and dramatic improvements to sanitation.

**Medieval:** Warfare in this era is defined by iron armor, crossbows, and weapons forged of fine steel.

**Enlightenment:** The development of black powder and muzzle-loaded, single-shot firearms greatly changes warfare, making plate armor mostly obsolete. Larger ships permit ocean crossings and long-range trade to distant shores. The printing press speeds literacy and the dissemination of new ideas.

**Steam:** Steam engines replace conveyances drawn by animal power or sail, leading to a significant shift from wood fuel to coal. Further advances in science lead to dirigible airships and observation balloons. Simple firearms are replaced by repeating revolvers and bolt action rifles.

##### Divine Involvement
<sup>GMG p. 124</sup>

What is the nature of the gods? Do they even exist? If so, are they omnipotent and omniscient? How does a follower request their divine favor? The answers to these questions will help you determine how strongly divine faith impacts the cultures of your world.

**None:** Deities do not exist in this world, or if they do, they are oblivious to or completely unconcerned with mortal affairs. If they exist, they don't make their presence known, nor do they grant power to their worshippers.

**Limited:** Deities exist, though they remain aloof from the mortal world and make their divine presence known only to a chosen few.

**Accepted:** Divine influence is an accepted fact of everyday life. Their will is enacted through priests and organized religions. Divine avatars may appear in the world during extreme circumstances.

**Ubiquitous:** Deities live among mortals, exerting their divine will directly. Gods rule entire nations, commanding absolute obedience from their faithful followers.

##### Magic
<sup>GMG p. 124</sup>

Does magic exist? If so, which traditions are available? What are the sources of a spellcaster's power, and how do they gain and channel that magic?

**No Magic:** Magic of any kind does not exist in this world. Spells and magic effects do not function. Consider the variants on page 196 to handle the lack of magic items.

**Low Magic:** Magic is mysterious and taboo. The few practitioners of the mystical arts are feared or shunned.

Again, consider the variants on page 196 to handle the relative scarcity of magic items.

**Common:** Magic is an accepted fact of everyday life, though its mysteries are beyond the reach of most people.

Magic portals and gates can whisk travelers "in the know" halfway across the world or to the other side of the multiverse.

**High Magic:** Magic and magical items are commonplace in society. It may be as easy to learn spellcasting as it is to learn a new language. Magical objects simulate various modern technologies.

#### Designing Nations
<sup>GMG p. 125</sup>

For any nation you establish in your setting, you'll want to provide at least a minimal descriptionâ€”the core concept of that nation. The amount of additional detail you provide depends on the needs of your story. You likely want to establish enough information to create a stat block (page 130) for the nation your adventurers are from, any nations they're likely to spend significant time in, and those nations' main allied and enemy nations, if they are likely to become part of the plot.

When building a nation, remember that the various elements connect to the history of the land and its people, its relationships with nearby nations, and the current residents. This interconnectedness will help you build a wealth of story hooks and provide immersive detail for your players.

Beyond those basic details, the following considerations can help flesh out the nations in your setting.

##### Location, Size, and Population
<sup>GMG p. 125</sup>

Major geographical boundaries, such as mountains, seas, and large rivers, often present natural borders for a realm. Depending on its leadership, culture, and the resources available, a country may be as small as a city-state or as large as a continent-sweeping empire.

Barring widely available technological or magical travel and communication, most nations remain relatively small (only a few hundred miles across), simply because it becomes too difficult for a single governing entity to oversee and maintain the entirety of a larger state.

National populations ebb and flow due to a multitude of external factors. Advances in sanitation, medicine, and agriculture can spur dramatic population growth, while war, famine, or plague can devastate it. As a rule, smaller nation-states have a population around a hundred thousand, while a continent-spanning empire could swell to well over a hundred million.

Population size is only part of the equation. Figuring out the ancestry ratios of that population and brainstorming how the members of various ancestries interact can often lead to interesting story ideas, or at least give you some jumping-off points when dreaming up how the nation was founded and its later history.

##### Cultural Hallmarks
<sup>GMG p. 126</sup>

What elements of the nation's predominant culture stand out? A nation might have an unusual stance on religion, a specific demographic, distinctive natural features, noteworthy political views, or any number of unique elements that differentiate it from other nations in your region. These hallmarks can inform your decisions about many other aspects of the nation.

##### History
<sup>GMG p. 126</sup>

How did the nation come to be? Has it stood since time immemorial, a bastion of stability while the rest of the world changes around it? Perhaps it was built over the ruins of another civilization, destroyed by some forgotten calamity. Or perhaps it is a young nation, born recently amid ongoing strife in your world. What remnants of the past can be found, or has the past been deliberately [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden)? How have the residents of the nation adapted to change, and in what ways have they failed to do so?

##### Economy and Political Stances
<sup>GMG p. 126</sup>

Determine the key resources and industries that drive the nation's economy. The availability of natural resources can establish national boundaries, local industry, and other elements of the resident society. For example, an area with few resources might have a nomadic society, while a nation rich in resources might develop an opulent mercantile class.

These resources can also affect international relationships.

An area poor in a specific resource might have a strong trade relationship with a nearby nation that has it, or they might be at war! Nations also disagree about political structures, public policy, religion, and any number of other factors.

You'll also want to consider the significant NPCs of each nation. This includes the official ruler, but it also includes other major players, whether they act in an official capacity or entirely behind the scenes.

> [!pf2-brown] CONSCIENTIOUS CULTURE DESIGN
> 
> Creating fantasy cultures is a delicate topic, as it can be all too easy to create a culture or a group based on damaging stereotypes or simplistic reductions of real-world groups.
> 
> Creating entire cultures out of harmful genre tropes such as "jungle savage" or "noble samurai" reduces real-world cultures to caricatures and perpetuates stereotypes about people from those cultures. Taking inspiration from the real world is wonderfulâ€”our world is filled with an incredible diversity of cultures and peoplesâ€”but you should do so with care and respect for those sources.

#### Building Settlements
<sup>GMG p. 126</sup>

In Pathfinder, settlements are where characters can rest, recharge, retrain, and dedicate themselves to other downtime activities all in relative peace. Traditionally, an adventuring band comes together in some kind of settlement, be it a small hamlet nestled on the border of some wild frontier or a bustling port city at the heart of a nation. Some adventures take place entirely within a single settlement, while in others the party visits settlements only briefly between their adventures in the wilderness.

The first thing you should consider when building a settlement is its role in your story. Is this a major metropolis the heroes will visit again and again during their adventurers? A backwater village where their adventures begin? The distant capital from which an evil tyrant issues cruel edicts? The settlement's campaign role will inform many of the other decisions you make about the place.

Once you know why you need the settlement, consider why it would exist in the world. Settlements are typically founded near sources of fresh drinking water; most commonly along a riverbank or a place with access to adequate wells or springs. They additionally require some kind of transit to other places, either roads or waterways.

While it may be easier to create a village or city merely to serve the characters' needs, determining what function it has independent of the characters adds verisimilitude and can provide hooks for further stories.

Settlements, on page 132, describes the components of a settlement stat block, which you should create for any settlement you expect your characters to visit. The process of creating that stat block will help you further flesh out your community.

##### Mapping a Settlement
<sup>GMG p. 126</sup>

Don't underestimate the usefulness of sketching a map of significant settlements, like the one where your adventure starts. This isn't intended to be a picture-perfect rendition drawn to scale, but rather to outline the rough shape and size of the settlement. Be sure to highlight a few key structures useful to the campaign. For more inspiration, see the section on Drawing Maps (page 52)

**Step 1. City Layout:** The layout of a settlement is as unique as the terrain upon which it is settled. First, decide the major trade route for the settlement. This is typically a river, which brings fresh water, fish, and fast transport to the populace. Larger cities can sustain additional growth with access to a deep-water harbor or a major overland trade road. Even settlements conceived with a grid plan tend to stretch along established trade routes before expanding outwards.

**Step 2. Districts:** Towns with a population over a thousand typically have defensive walls. As a settlement grows further in size and population, additional stone fortifications are often constructed beyond the city center, which further segment the city into districts or boroughs. A metropolis, for example, might have several distinct neighborhoods: Castle Ward, Noble Quarter, Temple Hill, the Gardens, Scholars' Court, Artisan Plaza, the docks, the slums, and so forth.

**Step 3. Markets and Shops:** Designate one or more open spaces in the settlement for a market square. This marketplace typically grows in the city center, along a major road intersecting the settlement's primary trade route. Lining the perimeter of the temporary tents and stalls of a bazaar are permanent retail shops offering pricier goods and services. Here in the beating heart of city commerce, adventurers can arm themselves for upcoming expeditions or sell their ill-gotten gains once making it back to the settlement.

**Step 4. Inns:** Heroes need a place to celebrate and recover between adventures. In addition to both public and private lodging, a settlement's inns often serve food and drink. As with the town market, inns are commonly built in central locations where trade roads meet. In your campaign, inns are ideal locations to spread gossip, introduce notable NPCs, and initiate quests. For the right price, innkeepers might rent strongboxes to secure money and other valuables between adventures.

**Step 5. Landmarks:** To give your cities a sense of personality and local flavor, design a handful of iconic landmarks for the PCs to visit. Memorable names make these landmarks more interesting. A random observatory might be noteworthy, but the Celestial Watchtower has an air of intrigue that could lead to a fun adventure hook.

### Religion
<sup>GMG p. 127</sup>

The greatest stories from myth and legend speak of immortals with incredible powers of creation and destruction. Some meddle in the affairs of mortals, shaping heroes and history at a whim, while others remain aloof or oblivious to the mortal world. Regardless of the world you're building, religion (or even the absence thereof) shapes the people and the stories you tell.

#### Theology
<sup>GMG p. 127</sup>

Religious traditions are commonly categorized by their belief in one or more divine entities.

**Polytheism:** This belief system posits the existence of many gods. Polytheistic gods typically espouse particular areas of concern and often reflect the appearance of their worshippers. The primary religious philosophy of the Age of Lost Omens is polytheistic.

**Dualism:** This philosophy espouses an enduring conflict between two diametrically opposed cosmic forces; most commonly good and evil or law and chaos. Acolytes of each faith almost always see themselves as righteous, and those of the contrasting belief as false.

**Monotheism:** A monotheistic doctrine recognizes the existence of only one true god. The supreme deity may exhibit more than one aspect yet remain a single entity, like Gozreh from the Age of Lost Omens.

**Pantheism:** Divine power arises from the universe itself, or as a byproduct of the collective power of many deities sharing some common facet, either way forming a vast, all-encompassing divine entity. Worshippers sometimes appeal to or devote themselves to specific fundamental concepts or aspects of the universe.

**Animism:** Rather than worshipping gods associated with souls and spiritual essence from beyond, animism sees the life force in each part of the world, whether it be the trees of an old-growth forest or a towering waterfall.

An example of animism in the Age of Lost Omens is the connection between the Shoanti people and their totems, which they forge a relationship with when they come of age.

**Atheism:** In some campaign worlds, the gods have all died, abandoned their worshippers, or never existed at all. Mortals of this world may still cling to belief and establish religions in the name of the divine, but there are no true deities to answer their prayers.

#### Pantheons
<sup>GMG p. 127</sup>

In polytheistic traditions, a pantheon is a divine hierarchy of multiple (or even all) deities.

**Universal:** All deities in the setting belong to a single pantheon. Different cultures might have their own names for the god of magic, for instance, but only a single deity answers their prayers.

**Ancestral or Regional:** Each ancestry or region worships its own distinct pantheon. These pantheons coexist in the same cosmology but establish control in separate divine realms. Across the cosmos, several gods from disparate pantheons may share the same area of concern, but they seldom compete for worshippers from rival pantheons.

**Competitive:** The world contains smaller regional pantheons competing for mortal worship. Only one deity of a specific area of concern may ascend to greater power across all the pantheons. As such, deities typically have little loyalty to their own pantheons and may actually switch to another pantheon if it earns them additional worshippers.

**None:** The deities of this multiverse act as individuals with no familial ties or common agenda binding them to each other.

#### Deities
<sup>GMG p. 127</sup>

These immortal beings command vast power and influence fueled by the faith and souls of mortal worshippers. In Pathfinder, deities also dictate some of the abilities of those champions and clerics who channel their power.

When designing deities, you'll need to include the divine statistics and devotee benefits described below.

##### Divine Rank
<sup>GMG p. 127</sup>

Gods are usually ranked in a divine hierarchy, from newly ascended godlings to almighty creator gods of unfathomable power.

**God:** Taking a position atop the divine pyramid, gods command near unlimited power and resources. Their mortal congregations are large and (usually) well funded.

**Demigod:** Demigods still possess a great deal of power, though often in subservience to another god or simply inferior to the power of a full god.

**Quasi Deity:** The weakest rank of divinity, many quasi deities are recently ascended mortals who attained their deific powers through ritual apotheosis, or planar natives who have amassed divine power of their own.

##### Divine Statistics
<sup>GMG p. 128</sup>

In Pathfinder, deities are not only a narrative element of the world, but also a mechanical component of some classes.

**Alignment:** A deity's alignment reflects their innate moral and ethical outlook. In the Lost Omens setting, most deities maintain realms tied to the Outer Plane that matches their alignment.

**Areas of Concern:** Each deity has one or more areas of concern they have divine influence over. These portfolios typically embrace universal concepts, such as honor, night, or tranquility. Deities with similar areas of concern may work in common cause or against each other, depending on their goals and divine rank.

**Edicts:** Every deity has edicts, which are those tenets they require their faithfulâ€”especially divinely empowered clergy like champions and clericsâ€”to promote in the world. A deity usually has one to three simple and straightforward edicts.

**Anathema:** The opposite of edicts, anathema are those things a deity will not abide. Champions and clerics must avoid their deity's anathema or risk losing their divine powers, and even lay worshippers usually feel guilty for performing such acts, as they will be weighed against them in the afterlife. Like edicts, a deity usually has two to three simple and straightforward elements to their anathema.

**Follower Alignments:** Champions and clerics can gain power from deities only if they share a compatible moral disposition. Usually these allowed alignments are chosen from those within one step of the deity's alignments, with NG, LN, CN, or NE deities rarely allowing N champions and clerics. Less restrictive deities are rarer and occur most often when the deity has multiple aspects or a particularly wide view of things.

##### Devotee Benefits
<sup>GMG p. 128</sup>

Deities grant favored status and special power to the most fervent and influential of their flock.

**Divine Font:** Clerics channel a deity's divine power as a font of negative or positive energy. Most often, good-aligned deities grant _heal_ while evil deities grant _harm_, with neutral deities most often offering a choice between the two. However, there's nothing inherently good about positive energy or evil about negative energy, so a specific deity's divine font may vary based on their areas of concern.

**Divine Skill:** Champions and clerics automatically gain the trained proficiency rank in their deity's divine skill. Assign the deity one skill that synergizes well with their areas of concern. For example, [Intimidation](compendium/skills.md#Intimidation) would be appropriate for a god of tyranny, or [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) for a goddess of trickery.

**Favored Weapon:** Clerics gain access to their deity's favored weapon as well as the trained proficiency rank with it; warpriest clerics gain additional benefits. Every deity has a favored weapon. Because the benefits of having an advanced favored weapon are very strong, you should assign simple or martial favored weapons unless a deity is so thematically linked with an advanced weapon that you need to give them one.

**Domains:** Each deity grants a number of domains that reflect their divine areas of concern. Champions and clerics can learn the domain spells from their deity's domains. Pathfinder's deities each have four domains, and many have one or more alternative domains. Though this number is usually enough to convey a deity's portfolio and give players sufficient options, you can give your deities as many domains as you like.

**Cleric Spells:** When preparing spells, clerics can choose from specific spells granted by the deity, in addition to those available on the divine spell list. A deity always grants a 1st-level spell and usually two others, all chosen from non-divine spell lists. The exact number of spells a deity grants can varyâ€”a magic-focused deity might grant one spell per levelâ€”though this shouldn't exceed one spell per level.

### Cosmology
<sup>GMG p. 128</sup>

An enduring curiosity among many cultures is to ask what wonders lie beyond the night sky. Does anyone gaze back from the moon above? What realms do the gods call home, and what is it like to walk in their divine presence? Is the mortal world at the center of the universe, or is all life utterly insignificant? Spiritual ponderings like these are central to belief systems across the globe. As a world builder, you get to answer those enduring questions by designing the multiverse in all its inexplicable grandeur.

The following are some aspects of your cosmology you might consider, but as you decide these, you should also consider how many of these details are known in your worldâ€”and by whom.

#### The Universe
<sup>GMG p. 128</sup>

The reality in which mortals live out their short existence is known to sages and scholars by many namesâ€”the universe, the Material Plane, or the mortal realm, among others. The structure of the physical universe might follow any of the following models, or it might be something completely different.

**Vast:** The universe is an unimaginably sparse void of infinite space, littered with stars, planets, and various bits of detritus.

**Limited:** The physical universe in your campaign world may be smaller in scope yet far more fanciful.

For example, in Hinduism, the cosmos is supported on the backs of four elephants, themselves standing upon the shell of a world-sized tortoise, whereas Norse cosmology describes nine worlds connected by an immense ash tree.

**Bizarre:** Sometimes the universe is more complex than the previous two categories, or possibly nested within multiple realities. What if the universe the PCs first know is in fact a magical or mechanical simulation of such complexity that its inhabitants are unaware that they themselves exist as an artificial consciousness?

#### Composition of Outer Space
<sup>GMG p. 129</sup>

The spaces between the stars can also affect the stories told in that world.

**Vacuum:** In conventional astronomy, outer space is an immense void existing in a near-perfect vacuum. In some settingsâ€”including the Age of Lost Omens, where it is known as the Dark Tapestryâ€”the trackless firmament between the stars is an ominous expanse home only to terrible beings of incomprehensible malice.

**Endless Sky:** What if the blue sky overhead extended outward forever? One need only fly high enough and far enough to reach another world.

**Celestial Spheres:** The ancient Greeks posited that planets, stars, are more were embedded like jewels within celestial orbs of quintessence nested within one another.

#### Solar System
<sup>GMG p. 129</sup>

What is the shape and structure of the solar system containing your game world? **Heliocentric:** Physics dictate that all planets in a system orbit the sun.

**Geocentric:** What if your game world is in fact the center of the star system, or perhaps even the center of the known universe? **Dyson Sphere:** Perhaps a solar system has been enclosed in an artificial structure designed to harness the power of the sun.

#### Planets and Moons
<sup>GMG p. 129</sup>

In antiquity, astronomers noticed that some of the twinkling lights in the night sky moved differently than the others. In time, these celestial wanderers would come to be known as planets, many with their own complement of orbiting moons. Are there other planets orbiting your world's sun? Are they terrestrial, gas giants, or something less common? How many moons are there? The characters may never venture there, but celestial bodies can have a strong influence on a culture and help you describe your world in an evocative and distinctive way.

#### The Multiverse
<sup>GMG p. 129</sup>

In Pathfinder, the physical universe of your world is one plane within a much broader multiverse. The Planes, on page 136, details how planes work and the multiverse of the Age of Lost Omens, but you can fit planes to your story and world, or even build a new multiverse from scratch! Perhaps there are only two planes beyond the material universe, diametrically opposed and fighting over mortal souls, or the multiverse consists only of a series of infinite alternate realities. The options are truly infinite, limited only by your imagination and the story you want to tell.

## Nations
<sup>GMG p. 130</sup>

Nations vary tremendously, from massive empires to isolated island realms, and their characteristics can give flavor and depth to your story and the PCs' adventures. An encounter in shadowy Nidal, where allegiance to Zon-Kuthon has literally blocked the sun from the sky, is going to have a very different tone than one in sun-drenched Thuvia. A nation working to overcome generations of xenophobia, like Kyonin, might have a different reaction to adventurers than a long-established empire like Taldor. A journey into a new nation can introduce the heroes to a new people (if the party visits the hobgoblin nation of Oprak), a new philosophy (such as the materialistic Prophecies of Kalistrade in Druma), or a new foe (as visitors to the undead-ridden Gravelands will certainly learn)

Nations can also provide adventuring inspiration and hooks. When the heroes are caught in the crossfire between two nations in conflict, national concerns become their own. Learning more about a nation's history or practices might lead to a great findingâ€”or a loathsome practice the characters want to eradicate. A party might get involved in the political machinations of a nation's elite power mongers, or they might fall out of favor and find themselves on the run from the law! Nations also influence a character's story on a personal level. A nation can suggest a character's ancestry, inform the languages they speak, and influence their choice of deity. As a GM, the relationship between a character and a nation can provide opportunities to better hook that character into your campaign. Has the character always lived there, or have they emigrated from elsewhereâ€”and why? A character who fled due to political persecution might have long-standing enemies, while a hero who left due to ideological differences might have friends and family who seek to return them to the fold.

### Nation Stat Block
<sup>GMG p. 130</sup>

The stat block for a nation presents the core information about a nation in a simple, streamlined format.

#### Nations of Lost Omens
<sup>GMG p. 131</sup>

Presented below are stat blocks for two nations from the Lost Omens Campaign Setting. You can use these as examples when building your own nation stat blocks.

## Settlements
<sup>GMG p. 132</sup>

For some players, a settlement may be nothing more than a convenient place to purchase gear and sell loot.

For others, a settlement might be a beloved home they're willing to risk everything to protect. And sometimes, an entire campaign takes place entirely within the walls of a single city.

### Settlements in a Game
<sup>GMG p. 132</sup>

Given the variety of roles a settlement can play in an adventure, a Game Master should have a firm understanding of how they work in the game and how to best use them. Virtually every settlement uses the rules for urban environments presented starting on page 514 of the _Pathfinder Core Rulebook_. Those rules are primarily intended for encounter mode, however, and so the following guidance can help you best use a settlement in the broader narrative of your game.

#### Settlement Adventures
<sup>GMG p. 132</sup>

Designing adventures in a settlement generally follows the guidelines presented in Adventure Design on page 40.

However, a settlement's greater population density also allows for a number of adventure styles and elements that aren't as common beyond the city walls.

Social encounters are one of the most common interactions within a settlement, starting with the guards at the city gates all the way to an audience with the queen. The influence and reputation subsystems (pages 151 and 164, respectively) can facilitate these interactions in a more structured way. Chase scenes, using the rules starting on page 156, are an iconic component of a settlement adventure, especially in a larger city, where dense buildings and a variety of structures make for an exciting series of obstacles. A settlement is also an ideal place for a party to conduct an infiltration (page 160)

Since most libraries, archives, and similar repositories of information are located within settlements, you might make use of the research rules (page 154). Ambitious characters might want to build up their own organizations using the leadership subsystem (page 168)

##### Modes of Play
<sup>GMG p. 132</sup>

Just like in other adventure locations, all three modes of play can happen in settlements. Since a settlement presents far more opportunities for noncombat activities than most other environments, characters likely spend most of their time in exploration mode. Downtime almost exclusively takes place within a settlement.

#### Marketplaces
<sup>GMG p. 132</sup>

Where there are people, there is commerce. The Buying and Selling section on page 24 provides several sets of guidelines for handling commerce in your game, but it can also be [helpful](rules/conditions.md#Helpful) to have a sense of what items and economic power a given settlement has on its own merits.

In a given settlement, a character can usually purchase any common item (including formulas, alchemical items, and magic items) that is of the same or lower level than the settlement's. Usually, fewer of the highest-level items are availableâ€”you can use Table 10â€“9: Party Treasure by Level on page 509 of the _Core Rulebook_ as a guideline for how many of the highest-level items might be available, using the Permanent Items and Consumables entries for a level 1 lower than the settlement's actual level. Inhabitants of a settlement can usually purchase items from PCs as long as those items are the same or lower level than the settlement, with limitations on higher-level items similar to those available for sale. If a settlement's population is significantly smaller than its level would suggest, its ability to provide and purchase items may be more limited.

If a character's level is higher than the settlement's, that character can usually use their own influence and leverage to acquire higher-level items, as they convince shops to place specialty orders or artisans to craft custom goods, though it might take a bit of time for such orders to be fulfilled.

Spellcasting services are available in many settlements. Barring a powerful spellcasting NPC in the city with whom the party could negotiate for services, a character can find someone to cast common spells up to a level that could be cast by an NPC of the settlement's level. For example, a character in a 9th-level city can typically find and pay someone to cast a 5th-level common spellâ€”the highest spell available to a 9th-level spellcaster.

Some settlements have access to uncommon items, formulas, and spells. If a settlement could reasonably be considered to meet the Access entry for an item or spell, that item or spell is available just like any common item.

For example, the dwarven settlement of Kraggodan has plenty of dwarf weapons available.

#### Power Structures
<sup>GMG p. 132</sup>

Outside of city limits, adventurers spend much of their time operating on their own terms, accountable only to their own moral code. But in a settlement, the heroes become part of a larger system with its own codified laws, procedures, and enforcement. The details of a settlement's power structures shape the party's interactions within that settlement.

##### Government
<sup>GMG p. 133</sup>

The government of a settlement often reflects the nature of that settlement. A lawful, militaristic city likely has a hierarchical government with a single figure at the top, a crossroads market town might be under the control of its wealthiest merchant families, and a farming community might simply look to the oldest residents for leadership as necessary.

That said, the lawful and publicly recognized ruler of a settlement isn't always the one calling the shots. They may merely be a puppet to a secret entity that silently pulls the strings from the shadows. Some settlements are ruled by [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) cabals, from strange religious sects to thieves' guilds. A settlement might be swayed by politically powerful residents, such an occult vizier or a political savvy high priest. In some cases, the legitimate authority may seem to govern but has actually been replaced by a faceless stalker, a devil in disguise, or another powerful shapechanger.

##### Legal Codes
<sup>GMG p. 133</sup>

Most civilizations agree that laws are necessary to ensure a functioning society. The specific laws range from one settlement to another, and they might be as simple as a prohibition against murder and theft to exceptionally convoluted regulatory schemes dictating everything from clothing details to available confections. How well known these laws are can further flavor a party's interactions with that settlement, as it's likely easier to navigate a well-documented system than one in which the rules are learned only through experience and word of mouth.

Much like a government, the legal codes reflect the settlement's alignment and overall nature. Generally speaking, a more lawful settlement is likely to have more complex laws, and a more lax locale to have fewer and simpler laws.

##### Law Enforcement
<sup>GMG p. 133</sup>

Most settlements have systems in place to enforce their laws. In a small village, the residents might just police themselves, holding one another accountable to their shared values. Towns and larger settlements usually have some system of guards, whether that's a post filled by a rotation of volunteers or a city guard of professionals paid by the city's government to maintain order. Most settlements have some way of dealing with criminals, from fines to public stocks to prison cells, as well as individuals responsible for meting out those sentences.

##### Organizations, Churches, and Factions
<sup>GMG p. 133</sup>

The government isn't the only influential factor in a settlement. Prestigious organizations, prominent churches, and specialized factions all wield power as well, often in conflict with the official government or one another.

Religious congregations usually wield significant power in communities where faith is strong. A wizard, sorcerer, or bard of even moderate magical talent would be a rare and influential member of society in a small settlement.

An organization can wield overt influence over the community where they're based, or subtle control, as the Pathfinder Society does in Absalom. Other notable factions may include noble houses, wealthy merchants, innkeepers, and retired soldiers and adventurers.

##### Corruption
<sup>GMG p. 134</sup>

In any settlement, it's possible for officials to put their own interests before those of the people they serve.

Corruption might be as simple as a clerk willing to accept a bribe to expedite some paperwork, or it might be as sinister as selling civilians into slavery.

### Settlement Stat Block
<sup>GMG p. 134</sup>

A settlement's stat block consolidates the basic information about a settlement into a centralized format.

#### Sample Settlement Abilities
<sup>GMG p. 134</sup>

Here are some common settlement abilities you can use to customize a settlement of your own creation.

**Artists' Haven:** Residents of this city have a deep appreciation for fine art. It's easier to find higher-level tasks involving [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) or art, as well as buyers willing to pay more for art objects.

**City of Artisans:** Items of up to 4 levels higher are available from a particular category the settlement is famous for, such as armor and weapons.

**Magical Academy:** The settlement prides itself on teaching magic, and its residents are skilled at teaching others. Choose a magical tradition or traditions suitable to your settlement. When a PC pays an NPC to teach them a new spell of that tradition in the settlement, the NPC assists the process and provides an additional +2 circumstance bonus to the check to Learn the Spell.

**Religious Bias:** This settlement has a strong affiliation with a particular religion. Anyone who is visibly a worshipper of that deity gains a +1 circumstance bonus to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks to Make an Impression, Request, and Gather Information. Characters who visibly worship one of that deity's foes take a â€“1 circumstance penalty to the same actions.

**Scholarly:** An abundance of public libraries or other accessible places of learning within this settlement means that with 1d4 hours, a character can access a scholarly journal on a relevant common subject (Core Rulebook 291) before attempting to Recall Knowledge.

#### Changing a Settlement
<sup>GMG p. 135</sup>

Sometimes the characters spend a long period of time in a single settlement. Perhaps it's their home base, where they spend their downtime between adventures, or perhaps the entire adventure takes place there. In these cases, you might find you need to update your settlement stat block as it changes over time.

Several elements of the settlement stat block are simple to update; you change the population as it grows or shrinks, and you change the leaders on your stat block as different people move between those positions. But you also might make changes that reflect the results of the PCs' adventures. If the heroes eliminated a major threat facing the settlement, you should remove that threat from the stat blockâ€”but if they drew the wrath of a new foe in doing so, you might add that new threat! You can also update the stat block's abilities, should the PCs' actions have that large an influence on the city. For example, if the party (using the leadership subsystem on page 168) built up a wizard school focused on crafting magical items, you might add an ability to the settlement stat block that increased the availability of magic items in the settlement's markets.

## The Planes
<sup>GMG p. 136</sup>

Exploring the planes offers several opportunities for high adventure, as well chances to discover the secrets of creation.

### Planar Traits
<sup>GMG p. 136</sup>

Each plane, dimension, and demiplane has its own properties and attributes. Planar traits can be [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) down into six categories: alignment, scope, gravity, time, morphic, and planar essence. Combined, those traits describe the laws and makeup of the plane. These appear in the plane's traits entry, though any trait that matches the Material Plane (described in the Normal entry in each section below) is omitted.

#### Enhanced and Impeded Magic
<sup>GMG p. 136</sup>

Some planes enhance certain magic and impede opposing effects. A plane that enhances a particular type of magic grants anyone [Casting a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with that trait a +1 circumstance bonus to their spell DC or spell attack roll with that spell. Impeded magic means a character who [Casts a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) or Activates an Item with the specified trait must succeed at a DC 6 flat check or lose the spell or activation.

#### Alignment Trait
<sup>GMG p. 136</sup>

Certain planes, particularly in the Outer Sphere, are attuned to an alignment. Most inhabitants share that alignmentâ€” even powerful creatures such as deities. Planes with the neutral alignment trait are more often a mix of alignments than strongly neutral, and planes with no alignment affinity simply don't have an alignment trait, rather than being neutral. Alignments are given as an abbreviation (_Pathfinder Bestiary_ 345), which appears first in the plane's list of traits.

Spells that share any of the plane's alignment traits are enhanced, and those with opposing traits are impeded. For instance, in the chaotic evil Abyss, chaotic and evil spells are enhanced, and lawful and good spells are impeded.

#### Scope Trait
<sup>GMG p. 136</sup>

Most planes are immeasurable, so immense they are impossible to quantify. Which immeasurable planes, if any, are infinite is a subject of debate among philosophers and scholars alike. Since so many planes are immeasurable, those planes omit a scope trait. Otherwise, the plane likely has either the [finite](rules/traits/finite-gmg.md "Finite Planar Trait") or [unbounded](rules/traits/unbounded-gmg.md "Unbounded Planar Trait") trait.

**Finite:** Finite planes consist of a limited amount of space.

**Immeasurable:** Immeasurable planes are immeasurably large, perhaps infinite.

**Unbounded:** Unbounded planes loop back on themselves when a creature reaches the plane's "edge."

#### Gravity Traits
<sup>GMG p. 136</sup>

Many planes have unusual gravity.

**Normal:** Bodies of great mass are the centers of gravity, and objects fall toward those centers with a measured amount of force relative to the size of the body.

**High Gravity:** As in normal gravity, bodies of great mass act as centers of gravity, but the force relative to the size of the body is greater than on the Material Plane. The Bulk of all creatures and objects is doubled, meaning creatures acclimated to normal gravity can carry only half as much. Creatures used to normal gravity move at half Speed and can jump only half as high and far. Physical ranged attacks are impossible beyond the third range increment (instead of the sixth). Creatures that fall in high gravity take bludgeoning damage equal to the distance they fell.

**Low Gravity:** As in normal gravity, bodies of great mass act as centers of gravity, but the force relative to the size of the body is less than on the Material Plane. The Bulk of all creatures and objects is halved, meaning creatures acclimated to normal gravity can carry twice as much and jump twice as high and far. Physical ranged attacks are possible up to the twelfth range increment (instead of the sixth). Creatures that fall in low gravity take no damage for the first 10 feet of a fall, and then take bludgeoning damage equal to a quarter of the remaining distance it fell.

**Microgravity:** There is little to no gravity on this plane. Creatures float in space unless they can push off a surface or use some force to propel themselves throughout the plane.

**Strange Gravity:** All bodies of mass are centers of gravity with roughly the same force. A creature can stand on any solid objects that is as large as or larger than themself.

**Subjective Gravity:** All bodies of mass can be centers of gravity with the same force, but only if a non-mindless creature wills it. Unattended items, objects, and mindless creatures treat the plane as having microgravity. Creatures on a plane with subjective gravity can move normally along a solid surface by imagining "down" near their feet. Designating this downward direction is a free action that has the concentration trait. If suspended in midair, a creature can replicate flight by choosing a "down" direction and falling in that direction, moving up to their Speed or fly Speed. This pseudo-flight uses the [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md) action.

#### Time Traits
<sup>GMG p. 137</sup>

Time flows differently on many planes.

**Normal:** Time passes the same way it does on the Material Plane. One hour on a plane with normal time equals 1 hour on the Material Plane.

**Erratic:** Time slows down and speeds up, so an individual may lose or gain time as they move between planes. When a creature moves from a plane with erratic time to one with normal time, roll a DC 11 flat check. Creatures that leave an erratic time plane together share the same result.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** Time passed normally on the erratic time plane.
> - **Failure** For each hour spent on the erratic time plane, 1 day passed on the normal time plane.
> - **Critical Failure** For each round spent on the erratic time plane, 1 day passed on the normal time plane.

**Flowing:** The flow of time is consistently faster or slower.

A creature may travel to one of these planes, spend a year there, and find that only an hour passed on the Material Plane; alternatively, they might spend a minute on this plane and find out an hour passed on the Material Plane.

**Timeless:** Time still passes, but the effects of time are diminished. Creatures on these planes don't feel hunger, thirst, or the effects of aging or natural healing. The effects of poison, diseases, and other kinds of healing may also be diminished on certain timeless planes. Spell energy and other effects still dissipate, so the durations of spells and other effects function as normal. The danger of this trait is that when a creature leaves a timeless plane and enters a plane with another [time](rules/traits/time-b2.md "Time Creature Type Trait") trait, the effects of hunger, thirst, aging, and other effects slowed or arrested by the [timeless](rules/traits/timeless-gmg.md "Timeless Planar Trait") trait occur retroactively in the instant of transition, possibly causing the creature to immediately starve or die of old age.

#### Morphic Traits
<sup>GMG p. 137</sup>

This trait describes how easily the physical nature of the plane can be changed. The Material Plane is the norm, but other planes can warp through the plane's own sentient designs or be manipulated by extremely powerful creatures.

**Normal:** Objects remain where they are (and what they are) unless affected by physical force or magic. Creatures can change the immediate environment as a result of tangible effort, such as by digging a hole.

**Metamorphic:** Things change by means other than physical force or magic. Sometimes spells have morphic effects. Other times, the plane's nature is under the control of a deity or power, or the plane simply changes at random.

**Sentient:** The plane changes based on its own whims.

**Static:** Visitors can't affect living residents of the plane or objects the denizens carry in any way. Any spells that would affect those on the plane have no effect unless the [static](rules/traits/static-gmg.md "Static Planar Trait") trait is somehow removed or suppressed.

#### Planar Essence Traits
<sup>GMG p. 137</sup>

Planar essence traits describe a plane's fundamental nature. For example, many of the Inner Sphere's planes are infused with an element or energy, each of which affects magic on those planes, and the Shadow Plane is awash with shadow. Outer Planes are fundamentally made up of quintessence, a philosophically aligned material with infinite potential for shape and state that conforms to powerful and prevailing beliefs.

**Air:** Planes with this trait consist mostly of open spaces and air of various levels of turbulence, though they also contain rare islands of floating stone and other elements and energies. Air planes usually have breathable atmospheres, though they may include clouds of acidic or toxic gas. Air magic is enhanced, and earth magic is impeded. Earth creatures often find themselves at a disadvantage within air planes, which tend to at least make them uncomfortable, as there is little solid ground for them to gain their bearings.

**Earth:** These planes are mostly solid. Travelers arriving upon an earth plane risk suffocation if they don't reach a cavern or some other air pocket within the plane's solid matter. Creatures who can't burrow are entombed in the plane's substance and must attempt to dig their way toward an air pocket. Earth magic is enhanced, and air magic is impeded. Air creatures are ill at ease, as they rarely have the space to move freely through even the most lofty warrens.

**Fire:** Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn with no fuel source. Fire planes are extremely [hostile](rules/conditions.md#Hostile) to non-fire creatures.

Unprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost immediately, and creatures wearing unprotected flammable clothing catch fire, typically taking `1d6` [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). Extraplanar creatures take moderate environmental fire damage at the end of each round (sometimes minor environmental damage in safer areas, or major or massive damage in even more fiery areas). Fire magic is enhanced, and cold and water magic are impeded. Water creatures are extremely uncomfortable on a fire plane, and any natural resistance they have against fire doesn't function against this environmental fire damage.

**Water:** These planes are mostly liquid. Visitors who can't breathe water or reach an air pocket likely drown. Water magic is enhanced, and fire magic is impeded. Creatures with a weakness to water take damage equal to double their weakness at the end of each round.

**Negative:** Planes with this trait are vast, empty reaches that suck the life from the living. They tend to be lonely, haunted planes, [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) of color and filled with winds carrying the moans of those who died within them. At the end of each round, a living creature takes at least minor negative environmental damage. In the strongest areas of a negative plane, they could take moderate or even major negative damage at the end of each round. This damage has the [death](rules/traits/death.md "Death Effect Trait") trait, and if a living creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points by this negative damage and killed, it crumbles into ash and can become a wraith (_Bestiary_ 335). Negative magic is enhanced, and positive magic is impeded.

**Positive:** These planes are awash with life energy. Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder, and sensations are more intense. At the end of each round, an undead creature takes at least minor positive environmental damage. In the strongest areas of a positive plane, they could take moderate or even major positive damage at the end of each round. While this might seem safe for living creatures, positive planes present a different danger. Living creatures regain an amount of HP each round equal to the environmental damage undead take in the same area. If this would bring the living creature above their maximum HP, any excess becomes temporary HP. Unlike normal, these temporary HP combine with each other, and they last until the creature leaves the plane. If a creature's temporary HP from a positive plane ever exceeds its maximum HP, it explodes in a burst of overloaded positive energy, spreading across the area to birth new souls. Positive magic is enhanced, and negative magic is impeded.

**Shadow:** Planes with this trait are umbral with murky light. On a shadow plane, the radius of all light from light sources and the areas of [light](compendium/spells/light.md) spells are halved. Darkness and shadow magic are enhanced, and light magic is impeded.

### Planar Stat Blocks
<sup>GMG p. 138</sup>

Each of the planes listed in the following pages includes a short stat block of key information. The plane's typeâ€” whether it is a plane, dimension, or demiplaneâ€”appears in the stat block's heading, followed by the traits that define that plane. The following entries also provide important information about each plane.

**Category:** This indicates whether the plane is an Inner Plane, Outer Plane, Transitive Plane, or dimension.

**Divinities:** A list of all of the deities, demigods, and other powers that call this realm their home.

**Native Inhabitants:** A sample of typical inhabitants of the plane. Also listed are the plane's petitioners, the souls of dead mortals who have been judged and sent on to whichever plane reflects the life they led. More information on petitioners can be found in _Pathfinder Bestiary 2_

#### Inner Sphere Planes
<sup>GMG p. 138</sup>

The planes of the Inner Sphere form the heart of the cosmos. They are the home of mortal life, the focus of divine attention, the source of mortal souls, and the origin point of the great cycle of quintessence that fuels the motions and stability of reality itself. Arranged in a nested series of shells, like layers of an onion, the planes of the Inner Sphere include, from outer to inner: the Elemental Planes of Fire, Earth, Water, and Air; the universe of the Material Plane; and at the very core of this cosmological ensemble, the raw forces of creation and destruction of the Positive and Negative Energy Planes.

#### Transitive Planes
<sup>GMG p. 140</sup>

At a minimum, each Transitive Plane coexists with one or more other planes, a relationship oversimplified by stating that Transitive Planes are just used to get from one plane to another. The mists of the Ethereal Plane overlap the planes of the Inner Sphere, while the Astral Plane borders every other plane in existence like the backstage of the cosmos.

Bright and dark mirrors of the Material Plane, the First World and Shadow Plane overlap the mortal world, albeit often in bizarre ways such that a short distance in one might be a vast gulf in the other. The daring, wise, or desperate can utilize these planes to bypass barriers in the Material Plane or rapidly cross vast distances through much swifter travel.

#### Outer Sphere Planes
<sup>GMG p. 141</sup>

The planes of the Outer Sphere are the manifest realms of alignment: chaos, evil, good, law, neutrality, and their admixtures, populated by celestials, fiends, monitors, and others who promote these moral concepts. These planes are the backdrop upon which the mortal afterlife reaches its apparent conclusion, and the end destination of the River of Souls. The Outer Planes are regions of stability adrift in the raw, chaotic quintessence of the primordial Maelstrom, its tides forever gnawing at their edges even as mortal souls sustain them. The Abyss manifests as cracks in the Outer Sphere's fabric, while rising from the metropolitan Axis is the Boneyard's spire, the location where mortal souls are judged and then sent to their final destinations, be they reward, suffering, or oblivion. The Outer Planes are places of majesty, wonder, terror, and danger outstripping anything mortal adventurers might encounter anywhere else.

#### Dimensions
<sup>GMG p. 144</sup>

Existing in the metaphorical space between the Transitive Planes and smaller, finite demiplanes, dimensions are a category unto themselves, defying the neat categorization of planar scholars and adventurers. Seemingly infinite in scale, not necessarily spatial in the same way as a plane, and overlaying every other plane at onceâ€”including one anotherâ€”dimensions and planes are most significantly differentiated in how each of them breaks the commonly held rules of the other. Although some scholars include other extraplanar realms within the ranks of dimensions, only two such realms are uniformly agreed upon and classified as such. The Dreamlands, also known as the Dimension of Dreams, is readily accessed by mortal dreamers, while the Dimension of Time is notorious for the near impossibility of accessing it as well as the bizarre, often deadly restrictions upon travel to and within its bounds.

### Demiplanes
<sup>GMG p. 145</sup>

Demiplanes are much smaller and more limited than planes or dimensions, and they come into being more easily. They may arise naturally where the raw chaos of the Maelstrom churns at the border of the Astral, crystallize around shed memories of dead mortals on their way to judgment, or coalesce within the mists of the Ethereal set into motion by the forces of the Positive and Negative Energy Planes. They can also be crafted by will and powerful magic to suit their designers' whims. Almost innumerable, each is distinctly finite, with their own nature and rules set at their creation.

Desna's demiplanar realm of Cynosure exists as Golarion's literal north star, silently visible in the night skies, hosting her servitors and petitioners in her divine realm at its heart. Other demiplanes are crafted by mortals, such as the Refuge of Nex, created by the titular archmage seeking respite and solitude, and the Hao-Jin Tapestry, a demiplane stocked with its creator's collection and accessed through a literal tapestry artifact she fashioned as its entrance.

Created not by gods or mortals, the Akashic Record is a demiplane thought to exist deep within the Astral as a repository of the collective knowledge and memories of the cosmos, secure and unchanging, but so difficult to access that most doubt its very existence. Other demiplanes serve darker purposes and are perhaps best left forgotten, though their mysteries often tempt the ignorant, the foolish, and the desperate. The Prison of the Laughing Fiend serves to bottle its enigmatic and godlike occupant, Tegresin the Laughing Fiend, bound by nameless divinities whose nature and reason changes with each telling of the story, while the Dead Vault was crafted at Golarion's core by the gods themselves to forever bottle Rovagug the Rough Beast, lest he escape and devour all existence.
